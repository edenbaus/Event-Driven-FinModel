Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) are seen at the lower end, with estimated price hikes of $282 and $995, respectively.

 Electric vehicles are forecast to cut into oil demand by 1M-2M bbl/day by 2035, according to oil industry consultant Wood McKenzie. That estimate is actually much more conservative than Bloomberg New Energy Finance’s estimate for EVs to impact demand by 8M bbl/day by 2035. For perspective, OPEC agreed this week to coordinated production cuts of 1.2M bbl/day which swung crude oil prices wildly. EVs are only sipping up the equivalent of 50K bbl/day currently. The general consensus even in the oil industry is that governments are moving toward major changes with pollution and emissions regulations. Just this week, the cities of Paris, Mexico City, Madrid and Athens all said they would ban the use of diesel vehicles by 2025. Beijing is also slowly adopting pro-EV policies. A higher mix of EVs in the future has already been tipped off by the dramatic long-term electrification initiatives announced this year by companies such as BMW (OTCPK:BMWYY), Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAY), Ford (NYSE:F) and Toyota (NYSE:TM).

 Elaine Chao is the pick of Donald Trump to be the Secretary of Transportation, according to numerous media outlets. Chao served in the cabinets of Bush 41 and Bush 43. Early analysis is that she may be a known quantiy to the Detroit Three (GM, F, FCAU) who worked closely with her on a post-9/11 task force and broadly during the Bush years. The big picture: There's been some concern over the impact of the Trump administration for EV sellers such as Tesla Motors (TSLA -1.9%), Nissan (OTCPK:NSANY) and Toyota (TM +0.7%) -- although the $7.5K federal tax break is already set to expire when automakers cross over the 200K U.S. EV sale mark.

 While Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) may have grabbed some headlines this week for its ambitious goals with autonomous driving (SAE level 5), the technology is being widely discussed across industries as a potential future reality. At a real estate conference in New York this week, a panel member called autonomous vehicles the biggest tech news concerning real estate in the last ten years. Some see a future reversal of urbanization trends in a development that could have significant investment implications. City planners and architects are already thinking of next-gen design. A paper titled "Beyond Google's Cute Car" (.pdf version) is a good example of how cities are being reimagined. Then there's this from the man who designed the 2015 Ford Mustang. "The next 10 years in this business is going to be the biggest change and challenge since the turn of the last century when cars took over for horses," said Ford design chief Moray Callum. Ford (NYSE:F) aims to have a  high-volume, fully autonomous SAE level 4-capable vehicle in commercial operation in 2021.

SUV and truck sales have outpaced small car sales by a wide margin this year and generate higher margins for the automaker - thus allowing more leeway for union wages.

 Self-driving Ford Fusions are out in the wild in Pittsburgh as part of Uber's test run of the concept. Engadget posted a picture of the Uber self-driving fleet for those in Steel City on the watch. Ford (F -0.9%) isn't directly involved in the initiative with Uber engineers grabbing the Fusions off the lot, although autonomous technology has been a major talking point at the company's analyst day event. Execs have also been talking numbers in Detroit. Ford expects to achieve cost efficiencies averaging $3B annually between 2016 and 2018. Auto capex is seen rising to 5.6% of revenue in 2018 from a current level of 4.9% - before tailing off again. Operating margin is expected to fall this year below the 6.8% mark from a year ago.

 Ford (NYSE:F) announces a set of goals ahead of its analyst day presentation. The company says it aims to deliver growth that matches or exceeds global GDP, improve its risk profile, deliver operating margins of 8 percent or more for its core business         and 20 percent or more for its emerging businesses. “As we expand to be an auto and a mobility company, we’re not moving       from an ‘old’ business to a ‘new’ business. We’re moving to a bigger       business,” notes CEO Mark Fields. Ford also is also plotting strategy in select emerging       markets. The company sees Russia and South America positioned for       recovery, ASEAN remaining profitable, and a path to profitable growth in       Middle East and Africa. As announced recently, $4.5B will be invested in electrified solutions and 13 new electrified       vehicles will be introduced by 2020. Ford intends       to have a high-volume,       fully autonomous SAE-defined level 4-capable vehicle in commercial       operation in 2021 in a ride-hailing or ride-sharing service.

 Singapore became the first country in the world to offer a self-driving taxi service with the targeted launch of nuTonomy. A full roll-out of an autonomous taxi service across the nation is expected as early as 2018. While self-driving cars from Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and others have been out testing on the roads for the last few years, nuTonomy's service is the first commercial application of the nascent technology open to public use. Uber (Private:UBER) plans to test self-driving cars in Pittsburgh next month. NuTonomy will use human drivers as backups in the initial roll-out of the Renault (OTC:RNSDF, OTCPK:RNLSY) Zoe and Mitusubishi (OTCPK:MMTOF) i-MiEV taxis before moving to full autonomy. Other companies with autonomous vehicles on their radar include Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY), Delphi Automotive (NYSE:DLPH), Volvo (OTCPK:GELYF), Ford (NYSE:F), Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA), Toyota (NYSE:TM), Hertz Global (NYSE:HTZ), Avis Budget (NASDAQ:CAR), Nissan (OTCPK:NSANY), BMW (BAMXY), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Honda (NYSE:HMC), FedEx (NYSE:FDX), Lyft (Private:LYFT), and General Motors (NYSE:GM) to name just a partial list -- although analyzing which stocks may benefit from a future of a mix of self-driving cars on the road is a tricky business.

 Ford (NYSE:F) says it will make an announcement at 2:00 p.m. EDT to discuss the company's expanding presence in Silicon Valley and autonomous vehicle development. The automaker will also host a conference call with analysts at 4:00 p.m. to discuss its smart mobility ambitions. The roster of Ford execs on the call include global development and technology heavyweights. Earlier today on CNBC, CEO Mark Fields joined the group of leaders predicting a seismic change in the automobile industry. "Our view is autonomous vehicles could have just as much [of an] impact on society as Ford's moving assembly line did 100 years ago," Fields noted. In an important revelation, Fields says more customers are telling the company that they are interested in the autonomous driving option -- an anecdote that  runs counter to the view of some that drivers don't want to give up the wheel (partially or fully). Field hinted that the scheduled autonomous announcement for today will be significant.

 Automobile deliveries in China soared 26% Y/Y to 1.6M units in July, according to the China Passenger Car Association. The pace of sales was the highest in over 40 months, although it came against a weak comparable from a year ago. Car deliveries in China are up 11% since the government lowered the tax on small vehicles to 5%. Demand for SUVs and crossovers remained strong, with deliveries up 47% to over 580K. Domestic automakers posted strong growth during the month, led by Guangzho Automobile (+37%), Geely Automobile Holdings (+72%), and Great Wall Motors (+49%).

 There's almost no chance that the automobile industry won't be a major talking point during the U.S. presidential election campaign which adds a layer of uncertainty for investors in the sector. While the ramifications of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Donald Trump's plan to add tariffs on foreign car makers and auto parts suppliers are already being debated, it's the union workers who may be the target of the most discussion in the next few months with Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania considered critical battleground stocks. The United Auto Workers endorsed Hillary Clinton and expects her to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement to help land stronger unions in Mexico, while Trump has taken a more populist route of promising to add tariffs on Ford for cars built in Mexico. He's also hammering home that he will force better trade deals, but is walking a tightrope with some Rust Belt voters after suggesting that local plants should be closed and moved to states with lower wages. Most analysts think it's more likely that the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit will expire if Trump wins the election than if Clinton ascends to the White House. The EPA and some its regulations are also sure to get a hard look.

The new second-generation 3.5-liter EcoBoost engine will provide 50       lb.-ft. more peak torque compared with the first-generation 3.5-liter       EcoBoost engine, to 470 lb.-ft.

 A thoughtful piece in Scientific American take a look at the technological challenges in delivering automated driving services. An electrical engineer at Carnegie-Mellon notes that the vision systems of today's automated test cars are imperfect by a "very good" margin. A mobility expert at the University of California concurs, while adding that drivers may be overestimating their car's automated capabilities due to the use of terms such as "autopilot" and "self-driving." A refined system of cameras, sensors, and radar is still believed by some engineers to be a few years off. Alphabet's (GOOG, [[GOOGL]) top exec in charge of the company's self-driving initiative seemed to back the view of the scientists in his recent testimony to Congress. "We saw in our own testing that the human drivers can’t always be trusted to dip in and out of the task of driving when the car is encouraging them to sit back and relax," he stated.

 An analysis of data from LendingTree suggests that millennials want to drive and own cars. "The share of millennial auto loan requests has climbed from roughly 27 percent in early 2013 to about 34 percent in 2016, suggesting a return of younger buyers to the car market," concludes Lending Tree after diving into loan requests. On a volume basis, the most popular cars that millennials requested a loan for were the Nissan Altima, Dodge Charger, Honda Accord, Chevrolet Impala, and Chevrolet Tahoe. Millennials opted for used vehicles at a slightly higher clip than older drivers, 46% vs. 44%. The crush of major automaker-tech firm partnerships (Toyota-Uber, GM-Lyft, Fiat-Google, Volkswagen-Gett) popping up is predicated in part on a younger generation attuned to ride-sharing and ride-hailing. There's also been an assumption by some analysts of a topping out of U.S. auto demand this year or next due in part to millennial disinterest.

 Automobile industry heavyweights are gathered in Beijing ahead of next week's major auto show. Many of the side interviews with exec are as revealing as the model reveals.
Ford (NYSE:F) CEO Mark Fields is on the scene. He has already tipped to reporters that the automaker isn't interested in a merger with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU). Last week, Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne teed up Toyota (NYSE:TM), Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAY), and the Blue Oval as the only remaining potential merger partners left in the industry. This year's event takes on added significance with local manufacturers increasing market share in China. During Q1, the top five selling models in the high-margin SUV category were all made by Chinese companies.
Automobile sales are expected to rise 7% in China this year, aided by a tax break on purchases. Some analysts think that demand will fall flat next year.
Another key topic will be the supply chain disruption due to the earthquakes in Japan. Most of the majors have been affected by the natural disaster.
Models being showcased next week at the Beijing Auto Show include the Acura CDX, Audi TT RS, Chevrolet FV2030, Jaguar XFL, and the all-electric LeEco.
The LeEco is made by the Chinese parent company of EV player Faraday Futures. Though there's plenty of room in the China EV market for LeEco, Tesla Motors, and others - a Bloomberg report this week indicated that EV sales numbers out of China can't be trusted.

 Ford (F +2.1%) will increase the range on the Focus electric vehicle to about 100 miles, according to top electrification exec Kevin Layden. The automaker sees the 100-mile level as satisfying a large chunk of the potential EV buying crowd.

 Some digging into Ford's (NYSE:F) sales in the U.S. during March by the Wall Street Journal indicates that the percentage of fleet sales was higher than normal at 40%. Sales at U.S. dealers were actually down 5% in the month. The trend could be a concern for Ford's bottom line with fleet sales typically less profitable than retail action. Ford's inventory at the end of the March was 23% higher than what the automaker carried last year and higher than the industry average.

Sales at Ford (NYSE:F) and GM (NYSE:GM) are booming, but you wouldn't know it from their share prices, Barron's says in a bullish cover piece this weekend.
Key concerns include a drop from Q1's torrid sales pace (both slid when March sales came in at a mere 16.56M (annualized)); weaker China growth; rising buyer incentives; and subprime loans.
But investors fail to appreciate the degree to which the two have achieved efficiencies since the last cycle. "That means it can sustain profitability - and show good profitability - late in the sales cycle,"  Annie Rosen, manager of the Fidelity Select Automotive Portfolio, says.
Ford trades for 6.6x 2016 earnings and 3.9x projected cash flow; GM fetches 5.6x and 3.4x.
Barron's thinks shares have 25% upside in the coming year, not including dividends of 4.9% for GM and 4.6% for Ford.

 The SAE 2016 World Congress is underway in Detroit with a large number of automakers and suppliers in attendance. An early theme from the event is the widespread acceptance of electric cars as an inevitability in the future. General Motors (GM -0.4%) R&D chief Larry Burns presented a slide showing the "New Automotive DNA" of electric drive, electric motors, and diverse energy sources (Twitter picture of slide). He also noted that the company expects driverless cars to be cheaper due to the lower cost parts. Self-driving cars are seen having some commercial applications even if broad acceptance is far-fetched. The powertrain manager at Toyota (TM +3.3%) said the automaker sees EVs, fuel cells, and hybrids "dominating" the industry. Strong words from the world's largest seller of cars.
What to watch: Upcoming talks at the conference on cybersecurity take on added significance with nearly every automaker hyping its connected car concept. Ward's Auto is covering the event on its Twitter feed.

 March U.S. auto sales rose 3% Y/Y but a disappointing adjusted annual rate of 16.57M vehicles came in well below analyst expectations and the 17.5M clip the industry enjoyed in February. Ford (NYSE:F), GM and Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) each reported sales gains but their results missed expectations, sending shares lower (I, II, III). The sales report “plays into the idea that with 2015 being a record  year, maybe we’re set up to start peaking a little bit in terms of consumer demand," Bloomberg's Kevin Tynan says. However, historically-low gasoline prices and interest rates continue to lure consumers to dealer showrooms, setting the stage for car sales this year to remain near 2015’s record 17.5M, says Barclays analyst Brian Johnson, who adds that some automakers will need to “cough up incentives to keep it there."

"There was a lot of talk a little earlier this year about recession, and when we look at those metrics, they're giving us a different story. Plus, if you look back over the years, there's never been a recession in the U.S. without having an increase in unemployment, and you're not seeing that.
"For us the main policy is making sure that currency is not used as a weapon, if you will, to manipulate the cost of products, whether they're imported or exported. We can compete with anybody around the world. We can't compete with central banks.
"We are transitioning from an auto company to an auto and a mobility company. Mobility for us, at the very simplest level, is to allow people to live, play, and work where they want. How do we help enable them to get around to do that? And there's a lot of talk around technology companies disrupting the auto industry. Our approach is very simple: We're disrupting ourselves."

 The percentage of BMW (OTCPK:BAMXY) vehicles either leased or financed went to 46.3% in 2015 from a level of 41.8% just a year prior, observes Bloomberg Gadfly. A massive jump for a short time period. Though the company isn't suffering from some of the delinquency issues that are picking up in the automobile industry (see subprime concerns for lenders, auto retailers, and Detroit majors), there could be implications down the road as a glut of vehicles come off their leases. Across the industry, vehicle leasing as a percentage of sales rose to 32.3% in February vs. the average of 28% in 2015. That's a development that could add to pricing pressure down the road for high-end and mass market brands as a higher percentage of vehicles come off their leases.

 Credit Suisse downgrades Ford (NYSE:F) to Underperform from Neutral. The investment firm assigns a price target of $13 to the blue oval. "We believe North American EBIT guidance is at risk on overly optimistic implied volumes and global inventories that have fallen meaningfully out of step with demand, while recent pricing/mix gains from new product launches in NA have been fully offset by material cost increases," reads the analyst note.
The take from CS could underestimate the cost savings and momentum in the U.S. for Ford seen by many other industry watchers (see the long case on Ford from SA contributors). F -3.0% premarket to $12.05. |Feb. 23, 2016, 3:24 PM|Car talk: Best cars and brands named by Consumer Reports

Concern that automakers will need to sacrifice pricing power to entice  buyers and reduce inventory may not be felt as keenly by GM, whose 1.9% drop in  U.S. sales last month was better  than it looks, according to J.P.

 Major automakers are stealing the show this week at CES in Las Vegas off of some dreamy futuristic innovations, but are slumping in New York trading on some grounded reality. Detroit automakers Fiat Chrysler (FCAU -6%), Ford (F -3.4%), and General Motors (GM -2.8%) are all notably lower. U.S. auto sales increased 9% Y/Y in December, but were boosted by some extra discounting. Still, the higher mix of SUVs and premium trucks could help to make up for the year-end inventory clearing, note some insiders. Even accounting for discounting, pricing trends improved in December compared to a year ago, reports Kelley Blue Book.
Looking ahead, the strong appeal of crossovers with millennials is seen as underpinning demand into 2016. There's been skittish trading across automobile related sectors. Earlier today, AutoNation rattled the auto retailer group with a warning, while auto parts stocks are down sharply once again - led by Federal-Mogul (FDML -5.8%), Stoneridge (SRI -5%), and Lear (LEA -4%). |Jan. 5, 2016, 6:56 PM|U.S. auto sales set record in 2015 but face slower growth this year


U.S. automobile sales totaled a record 17.47M in 2015, up 5.7% Y/Y, even as  December sales trailed economist expectations, according to figures from  automotive research firm Autodata.
Analysts and execs foresee another record in 2016 but at a slower rate of growth, and provided that the automakers continue to serve a heavy helping of discounts.
The effects of discounts were felt in December, as industry sales set a record for the month even while falling short of predictions, in part because automakers kept their incentives even  with November after starting early with year-end dealmaking; as a result, most auto stocks fell in today's trade - including GM -2.6% and Ford (NYSE:F) -1.8% (I, II) - except for Nissan (OTCPK:NSANY),  whose sales led the group with a 19% Y/Y gain.
Slowing growth and rising incentives may add pressure on profits industry-wide, according to auto analyst Jeff Schuster, who says 2015 "will be the year that will really test the discipline of the manufacturers."

A huge talking point will be Ford's (NYSE:F) presentation when Mark Fields will talk strategy. The billion-dollar question is if Field will formally announce a self-driving car partnership between Ford and Google. That collaboration could influence EV demand across the board. Perhaps the most interesting EV reveal at CES will be when Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAY) exec Dr. Herbert Diess uses a keynote address to discuss the German automaker's electric car initiative. Diess will leave the diesel emissions scandal in the rear-view mirror to unveil Volkswagen's EV concept car. Autocar reports that an electric Microbus will be unveiled.

Yahoo Autos reports Google/Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Ford (NYSE:F) are creating a JV that will build self-driving cars using Google's technology. The companies reportedly plan to announce their effort at CES (runs from Jan. 6-9).
The JV, which limits Ford's legal liability, is said to be non-exclusive. Google has also been talking with other automakers, as it pushes forward with a goal of bringing a self-driving car to market by 2020. The company has suggested it doesn't want to be an auto manufacturer itself, but rather a hardware/software supplier to third-party automakers.
The report comes a week after one from Bloomberg stating Google plans to make its self-driving car unit a separate Alphabet company. In September, Google hired ex-Hyundai America chief John Krafcik to lead its self-driving efforts.
Google has a head-start in both creating advanced self-driving systems/prototypes and collecting real-world driving data - it has logged 1.3M miles to date - but is far from alone in going after the market. Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Nissan, Volvo, and Tesla are among the existing automakers to have invested in autonomous driving R&D. Baidu, Samsung, and Uber are also interested, and Apple reportedly so.

Proposed rules in California would require drivers in the state to apply for a special driver's license before being allowed to use an autonomous car. The self-driving car would also go through an independent test before being set free on the road. Self-driving cars will only be available for lease if the proposed regulations are approved. Controversial issues with where insurance liability will fall are still being hashed out.
Most automakers are dabbling with self-driving cars or autonomous features, while Alphabet has the most advanced program. However, by the looks of it the Alphabet concept vehicle could have trouble with the California DMV standards.

 Ford (F +1.9%) says it's received a permit to begin tests of its fully autonomous self-driving Fusion Hybrid models on California's public roads. The company is expanding work on autonomous vehicles at its Palo Alto Research and Innovation Center, where it has more than 100 employees working on the project after it opened in January. The lab has conducted research on virtual test driving, fusing the views that various sensors on a vehicle provide, pedestrian detection, and data-driven health care for rural Africa. Google (the old name for Alphabet) had said a year ago that it was talking with Ford as well as GM, Toyota and others about bringing a self-driving car to market by 2020. Ford also will work with cloud company Pivotal to speed up its connected-car work and boost its recently launched Ford SYNC Connect offering. Initial features include door lock/unlock, scheduling starts to warm up or cool down the vehicle, check fuel/oil levels and locating the vehicle. |Dec. 15, 2015, 6:18 PM|Corning lands automotive windshield design win for Gorilla Glass


The latest version of the Ford GT supercar will be the first production vehicle to have a windshield that contains Corning's (NYSE:GLW) Gorilla Glass. The GT also uses Gorilla Glass for two other applications.
Corning and Ford (NYSE:F) state the use of Gorilla Glass lowers the car's weight by more than 12 pounds. Pound-for-pound, Corning claims Gorilla Glass has over 5x the strength of standard window glass.
With Ford pricing the GT at $400K and aiming to sell ~250 units/year, the design win is far from a high-volume one. However, it serves as a useful reference win for Corning, which has been pitching automakers for years on Gorilla Glass' ability (for a price) to make cars lighter, more fuel-efficient, more aerodynamic (lower center of gravity), and quieter inside.

Morgan: U.S. automakers ending year with a bang

 J.P. Morgan sees a strong end to the year for automakers Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM), with a particularly strong November in the U.S. ahead as well as China sales beating expectations. The firm's Ryan Brinkman sees U.S. light vehicle SAAR heading up to 18.5M in November from October's 18.1M (which itself was up 10% Y/Y) -- meaning that not only would November purchases beat all other November figures, they would be the most of any other month in the current cycle. While incentives are down Q/Q, they're up about $100 Y/Y but resulting in average transaction prices up more than $1,000 from a year ago. “Some automakers we spoke to were surprised at the rate of improvement in recent months, pointing to unexpectedly strong consumer reaction to only modestly higher incentives, which has lowered inventories (a recipe for strong profitability),” Brinkman wrote.

 The average price for a gallon of gas in the U.S. has now dropped to $2.06 per gallon - a mark that is 27% lower than where gas prices stood heading into the holiday period last year. Despite the extra dollars in the wallets of consumers, most forecasts for holiday retail sales are on the modest side (below 4%). The extended period of sub-$3 gas prices in the U.S. hasn't exactly lit consumer spending across broad retail on fire (just ask Wal-Mart) - although it has stoked auto sales for the Detroit Three (GM, F, FCAU). The regional casino sector (ISLE, PENN, BYD, ERI, MTN, MCRI) and cruise line stocks (NCLH, RCL) have also benefited more than major chain stores. Some have suggested that lower gas prices are also an understated driver for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) which both score high on customer stickiness. What next?

 The United Auto Workers union ratifies a four-year labor agreement with General Motors (NYSE:GM), after most rank-and-file GM workers voted in favor of the new contract two weeks ago. The new contract, which goes into effect on Monday, calls for raises for all workers and the end of the two-tiered pay system; average labor costs, of which pay is nearly half, for GM workers will be $60/hour by 2019, up from $55 now, according to a new study by labor analysts released today.
Meanwhile, the UAW is racing to save a proposed labor deal with Ford (NYSE:F) that would mark a significant setback if rejected; a vote today at a Dearborn, Mich., plant is considered critical, and earlier plant  tallies had contract opponents leading by ~1,500 votes.

The harsh assessment was mirrored by several heavyweight CEOs at the Tokyo Motor Show. The major focus of the event has been next-gen concepts like hydrogen-powered cars and self-driving features, while execs such as Nissan's Carlos Ghosn have marginalized the future of diesel. Many automobile industry insiders have noted that diesel was in decline due to the focus on emissions even before Volkswagen (OTCQX:VLKAY) rocked the industry with a cheating scandal.

The gigantic bet by Ford (NYSE:F) on using aluminum in the popular F-150 line is starting to pay off as production wrinkles smooth out and consumers show confidence in the truck's reliability.
The gap between Ford F-150 sales and Chevrolet Silverado sales has widened in recent months as positive reviews on performance continue to pour in.
F-150 sales in September improved 16.4% Y/Y to 69,651 units. Perhaps more important than the raw volume number, the average F-10 sticker price was up $6.1K from a year ago.
What's next: An aluminum-bodied Ford Expedition was spotted near the Ford development center in Dearborn, Michigan.
Bottom line: Ford is up 11.8% over the last 52 weeks. Some auto industry analysts think that concerns on the F-150 roll-out have been a drag on share price.

On to General Motors! Fresh from securing member approval of a labor contract with Fiat Chrysler, the United Auto Workers is turning its attention to wage negotiations at GM, where union leaders believe they have the best chance of sealing a quick deal.
Officials aim to use the new four-year pact reached at Fiat Chrysler as a template for talks, although UAW President Dennis Williams has signaled he will press for a richer deal because GM is more profitable.
In the meantime, talks with Ford (NYSE:F) will be put on the back burner.

The proposed labor contract between the United Auto Workers union and Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) isn't necessarily the same wage deal that will be pressed upon other Detroit automakers, UAW Vice President Jimmy Settles told Ford (NYSE:F) workers.
For several years, contract deals struck by Ford, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Chrysler have largely mirrored one another, but the union's longtime commitment to pattern bargaining seems to be weakening based on the diverging finances of the carmakers.

 With market eyes on a Fed rate-hike decision considered to be a bit of a toss-up amid differing opinions, Goldman Sachs is banking on the (slightly) more dovish position that the agency will wait until December. The bank is still laying out how to play the hike when it invariably comes. 
Strength in balance sheets is what you need, it says, noting that those companies outperform (by an average 5%) in the three months after a rate-boosting cycle begins. In Goldman's "High Quality Stock" basket: CMG, DLTR, PEP, KMI, BLK, GOOG, AAPL, PCLN, ORCL, WFC. Meanwhile, it suggests avoiding companies with high floating-rate debt as they bear the brunt of a move away from near-zero interest rate policy. "When the tightening cycle finally starts, the immediate impact will be felt by firms with high proportions of variable rate borrowing." Included in that "avoid" list: CL, COL, JNJ, AAPL, EBAY, MET, KO, GIS, F, MCD, GM, TWX, CVX, AGN, MON.

A self-proclaimed "kid in a candy store" in 2011, Lowes (NYSE:L) CIO Joe Rosenberg isn't as excited now as he was then, but he remains a long-term bull and sees a few particular pockets of value.
Source: Barron's

On oil, either OPEC and non-OPEC countries reach an agreement to cut production and the price spikes upward, or there isn't an agreement and the price collapses - wiping out a lot of production. Either way, the price moves higher, says Rosenberg, and energy stocks (XLE, OIH) have likely bottomed.
Rosenberg doesn't think the dividend gets cut at Chevron (NYSE:CVX), noting board members like John Stumpf were buyers of the stock at much higher levels. "The probability of them then agreeing to a dividend cut seems somewhat remote." A similar case can be made for Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) or ExxonMobile (NYSE:XOM).
Catalysts for Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) include a breakup into three companies, and better capital allocation - notably, getting far more aggressive with share repurchases. "JNJ could raise $50B in the bond market in a heartbeat and use that money to buy back stock." Don't rule out an activist investor if management doesn't get with it.
Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) are "incredibly cheap," says Rosenberg. The strong sales pace is sustainable because the average age of cars on the road in the U.S. is about 11 years - they need to be replaced. "The stocks are discounting a very bearish scenario."

The automakers are Audi (OTCPK:AUDVF), BMW (OTCPK:BAMXY), Ford (NYSE:F), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Mazda (OTCPK:MZDAY), Mercedes Benz (OTCPK:DDAIF), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Toyota (NYSE:TM), Volkswagen (OTCQX:VLKAY) and Volvo (OTCPK:VOLVY).
The systems could prevent or mitigate 80% of the  ~1.7M rear-end collisions that cause ~1,700 deaths and 500K  injuries annually in the U.S., according to the National  Transportation Safety Board.
The announcement does not specify a timetable for implementing the change.

 Automobile sales in China fell 3% to 1.7M in August, according to an official tally from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Tighter restrictions on pollution and the impact of a cooler China economy remain significant factors. The decline is an improvement over the 7.1% slide in July, but puts YTD sales growth flat compared to last year. A top official with CAAM warns negative sales growth for the full year is possible. Strong sales of SUVs in the nation couldn't offset weak demand for sedans during the month. Domestic brands took sales from global sellers in August, improving their market share by 50 bps to 39.4%. Japanese automakers have also gained ground over the last several months. The development hits German automakers and the Detroit Three particularly hard due to their investments in China. Some analysts think sales could be tepid until the Chinese New Year next February when demand is traditionally stoked.

 Automobile sales remained under pressure in China in August as demand for higher-priced imports continues to fade. General Motors (NYSE:GM) reported a 4.8% drop in retail sales to 248,815 units through its joint ventures in the region. SUV models Buick Envision and Baojun 560 sold well during the month. Ford China (NYSE:F) sales declined 3% to 79,608 units. Nissan's (OTCPK:NSANY) sales in China were off 5.5% during the month.
Mercedes-Benz (OTCPK:DDAIF) and Honda (NYSE:HMC) picked up market share in China during August with positive sales growth. Both automakers have introduced fresh models this year in key categories.
Toyota (NYSE:TM) was the big winner during the month with a 20% Y/Y pop in sales to 94,200 units. YTD sales in China are up 13% for the Japanese automaker. |Sep. 3, 2015, 2:26 PM|Ford Sollers aims for more local production

 The timetable by Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) to introduce its mass-market Model 3 in two years appears to give the Chevrolet Bolt EV a head start with EV buyers in the $30K-$35K range. Though development on the Bolt has been quieter than the news coming out of Fremont, Reno, and Elon Musk's twitter account - GM is reported to have hand-built protypes up and running and sales to consumers planned for 2017. Early review for the Bolt could be important with Tesla having a solid track record of dazzling reviewers with performance on the EV high-end. Nissan (OTCPK:NSANY) is also player in the mass-market EV market with a new long-range Leaf in the works. Ford (NYSE:F) has denied reports it's working on a long-range EV. If the Los Angeles Auto Show comes and goes in late November with no official announcement from Ford, then it may indicate the Detroit automaker will sit out the initial battle. Toyota (NYSE:TM) isn't a pure EV player, but is busy with its hydrogen-powered Mirai introduction and has the well-established Prius program cycling along.

 Automobile industry labor issues have been teed up as a political topic with most 2016 Presidential candidates delicately walking a tightrope over the issue. The UAW is in the process of negotiating critical new contracts with Detroit automakers which involves tough talk on both sides as well as the Big Three (F, GM, FCAU) using the leverage of potentially moving more production to Mexico or Canada. One candidate making a lot of noise about automakers is Donald Trump. The GOP front-runner in the polls believes opening up more U.S. states for auto manufacturing would lead to lower wages across the board and take Mexico out of the equation. It's a position the UAW will challenge vociferously, and as pointed out in the Detroit Free Press, may backfire in the long run.
Trump also promises a tougher stance on Japanese automakers (OTCPK:NSANY, TM, HMC, OTCPK:MZDAY, OTCPK:SZKMY, OTCPK:FUJHY, OTCPK:MMTOF) - a populist stance that some other GOP candidates will be hesitant to match due to trade implications.

The regulator plans to focus on if wireless components supplied to Fiat are also used in other vehicles on the road in a way that isn't fully secure from remote access.
The U.S. Copyright Office is also a major player in the hacking drama. This fall the government body will rule on if third-party researchers can access components and software to check for vulnerabilities. The open source vs. proprietary debate will be familiar to tech investors.

 Major automakers face pressure from a drop in demand in China amid economic weakness. Deliveries turned negative in June for the first time since February of 2013 and the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers now expects industry sales growth of 3% vs. a prior forecast of 7%. Vehicle sales were up 1.4% to 11.85M units during 1H. Volkswagen (OTCQX:VLKAY) relies on China for half of its net profit and 71% of free cash flow. Credit Suisse notes the China factor gives the German automaker the punch to make a dividend possible. General Motors (NYSE:GM) churned up 40% of its new income and 20% to 30% of its operating cash flow from China, according to an estimate from Barclay tied to its downgrade of GM earlier in the week. Goldman Sachs and Buckingham Research have also recently cut profit estimates on GM. Ford (NYSE:F) cut its sales outlook for the China auto market to 24M-26M vehicles after Q1. The company could revise the broad forecast lower again with its Q2 report on July 28 and reset its own sales expectations. There's been some pricing cuts by the Japanese automakers (OTCPK:NSANY, TM, HMC, OTCPK:MZDAY, OTCPK:SZKMY, OTCPK:FUJHY, OTCPK:MMTOF) and German high-end sellers (OTCPK:BAMXY, OTCPK:DDAIF) as they adjust to the "new normal" in China. Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) is still trying to get out of first gear in China. The reception to the Model X debut next year and the impact of EV subsidies are key factors.

 Ford (F -1.6%) is offering incentives at a significant level on the deluxe version of its 2015 F-150 in some regional markets, according to industry watchers. Overall F-150 sales have lagged some forecasts this year as production has ramped up slower than expected. Kelley Blue Book's Akshay Anand calls the development a possible "hint" that the F-150 faces demand issues. A more plausible explanation may be that the automaker is just fine-tuning its pricing with the more expensive F-150s loaded with all kinds of extra features and options.

The big picture: Detroit automakers are expected to use the low-cost option of producing cars in Mexico as a bargaining chip in the contract talks with the UAW set to start in August.

 Ford (NYSE:F) is upgraded at Goldman Sachs by the same analyst who took GM down to a Neutral rating. The different take on the two Detroit automakers is based in part on the pricing edge that Ford is seen holding.

 The EPA and NHTSA have published a new set of rules covering fuel efficiency on medium and heavy duty vehicles built for the model year 2018 and beyond. The agencies forecast the program will cut greenhouse gas emissions by 1B metric tons and lower fuel costs by $170B for the lifetime of the vehicles manufactured under the program. Though the release of tighter emission rules has been widely anticipated, perhaps a bigger surprise this week was the strong statement made by Pope Francis on the global need to address climate control.

 Electric vehicles sales in the U.S. are tracking almost even with last year's pace after five months. An increase in advertising and key price cuts on some models contributed to a M/M boost in demand in May, according to analysts. There's also the ZEV factor as automakers balance EV production levels against government mandates. Despite the sluggish pace of EV sales over the last year, a fresh report from Navigant Research estimates 1.1M plug-in electric vehicle sales by 2024 as more models are introduced with extended ranges and mass-market pricing. TrueCar estimates several models will sell over 100K per year after the 200-mile range threshold is crossed.

 A 25-page thesis from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles titled "Confessions of Capital Junkie" presents the case that automakers need to consider consolidating through mergers. The automobile industry is set up for failure unless costs from R&D and regulatory changes can be shared on a larger scale, according to the company. "Capital consumption rate by OEMs is unacceptable—it is duplicative, does not deliver real value to consumers and is pure economic waste," reads the presentation. There's even a slide with a quote from Alice in Wonderland to hammer home the automaker's main points on the need for M&A. Today, Ford CEO Mark Fields told CNBC the company isn't looking for a merger within the auto space. Similar comments have been made by execs with General Motors, Nissan, and Toyota in the recent past.

 A self-driving car from Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) would be considered legal in 45 states at the moment, according to analysis from Wired. That 90% ratio is expected to change. The self-driving issue is likely to be teed up politicians and regulators over the next year as Tesla's new software update pushes up the timetable on the autonomous car concept.
In Germany, for example, an explicit ban exists on autonomous driving. Another riveting puzzle: How does the software code get tested? There's also the question of what the insurance industry will have to say about the burgeoning technology and how much advanced sensor components will cost. Automobile experts think some functions such as self-parking, car retrieval features, and collision prevention technology will be approved federally and locally - while the full Muskonian dream may be a reach.

 Investors betting on the Chinese automobile market need to factor in how runaway pollution impacts investment potential, warn analysts. The air Pollution index in China has hit dangerous levels this week with Beijing registering a 168 today and Nanjing hitting a shockingly high 288 yesterday (extremely unhealthy). Other cities with an "unhealthy" reading on air quality include Guangzhou, Nanjing, Maanshan, Chengdu, Chuzhou, Zhenjiang, Yahgzhou, Wuhu, and Hong Kong. Reports indicate the Chinese population has become more concerned about the medical ramifications of long-term exposure to pollution. Some automobile industry watchers think foreign car manufacturers could benefit at the expense of domestic automakers if the government in China is to take further steps to push low-emission cars and EVs.

General Motors (NYSE:GM) shares sank 5.8% today to a new 52-week low after Morgan Stanley  said GM's overseas risks are the same as those taking a big  bite out of Ford's (NYSE:F) earnings.
“Ford’s reduced outlook was based on increased macro pressure in Russia, Latin America and FX and quality-related issues,” Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas wrote in cutting his price target for GM shares to $27 from $29, adding that “GM’s exposure to each of these factors is at least as great as Ford’s."
GM has targeted a North American EBIT margin of 9%-10% by 2016, but Jonas forecasts only 7.2% in 2016 and 5.8% in 2017; while "a 10% margin is technically possible," Jonas wrote, "when we consider the full balance of risks and opportunities facing [North America's] light vehicle industry in terms of volume growth, mix, content and pricing, we believe a margin of 0% has a similar probability."
Ford also tumbled to a 52-week low today, falling 2.9%.

 Automobile prices in the U.S. rose 0.1% M/M and 2.1% Y/Y during July, according to estimates from Kelley Blue Book. The increase is due largely to a slight shift in mix toward SUVs and crossovers. General Motors (GM -0.4%), Chrysler (OTCPK:FIATY), and Volkswagen (OTCQX:VLKAY) showed the biggest gains of the major automakers. Edmunds sees the overall industry selling rate to be right at 16.8M units for the month. Truecar.com has its eyes on the incentives being offered by dealerships. The firm estimates incentive spending was up 8.4% Y/Y in July to mark the biggest jump since 2010 as automakers looked to clear inventory.

 Ford (F -0.8%) CEO Mark Field urged Congressmen today to take a harder line on currency manipulation as they negotiate over the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement.

 Ford (F -0.2%) will moderately increase the prices on F-150 trucks with the 2015 line to account for new features, according to execs.

Hammering away at the misconception that it pays to seek active managers in supposedly "less efficient" sectors like small caps, S&P Dow Jones' Philip Murphy finds - even choosing among the top mutual fund share classes - an alarmingly small number of managers failed to beat the benchmarks.
Starting at the March 2009 bottom and going out five years, only 9 of 139 share classes  beat the S&P SmallCap 600 benchmark (that's 5.9% of the starting set).
Where alpha might be able to be delivered though, is in choosing which benchmark to track. A fund tracking the S&P SmallCap 600 (IJR, VIOO) would have outperformed one tracking the Russell 2000 (NYSEARCA:IWM) by 23% over the 5-year period.

 In his first major personnel move since becoming CEO July 1, Ford (F -0.1%) CEO Mark Fields appoints Kumar Galhotra, currently Ford’s VP of engineering, as president of Lincoln, where sales have fallen 65% from a  1990 peak. Galhotra, a 25-year company vet, has overseen the engineering development of Lincoln’s new models, which also include a restyled  Navigator large SUV coming later this year, the mid-sized MKX SUV debuting next year and a replacement for its large MKS sedan after that. Lincoln ranks eighth among luxury brands sold in the U.S., and it is outsold by almost two-to-one by GM’s Cadillac luxury line. |Jul. 21, 2014, 12:22 PM|Citigroup analysts have high hopes for GM earnings, not so much for Ford

 Citigroup expects a big Q2 earnings beat from General Motors (GM -0.2%) but is somewhat less optimistic about Ford's (F +0.1%) results when the two automakers release their financial results on Thursday. The firm lifts its Q2 EPS estimate for GM to $0.63 vs. $0.57 consensus, led by North America, where it forecasts $1.7B adjusted EBIT (~11% margin excluding recall costs) on higher production/truck mix, exceptional pricing (Q2 ATPs up more than $600 Q/Q) and arguably easier structural cost comparisons; unlike last quarter, 2014 guidance should suggest an accelerating H2 EBIT pace consistent with GM’s June update.
Cit's Q2 EPS for Ford is reduced to $0.36 mostly on taxes vs. $0.36 consensus, with pre-tax auto EBIT at $1.7B; although the firm isn't expecting an earnings beat, it believes the quarter/outlook could still result in upward 2014-15 Street revisions. |Jul. 18, 2014, 2:43 PM|Massive number of U.S. auto recalls only dent sales slightly

 Buried inside an economic report from the Richmond Federal Reserve this week is an interesting tidbit on the auto industry. As part of its scan of the economic horizon for the Beige Book, the bank noted the massive wave of automobile industry recalls has only had a "slight adverse" impact on sales. Customer traffic was still up and new car sales strong on solid pricing. The read from Richmond is consistent with recent U.S. sales reports from major automakers, although with a slight disconnect existing between a "sale" and a "delivery" in the industry the confirmation is noteworthy.
Chaos theory: Some industry analysts think recalls can actually spur sales as safety is teed up as a consumer issue and older cars replaced.

Ford earned a profit of $54M for the Africa and Middle East region in Q1, a mark some analysts see doubling by next year. |Jul. 15, 2014, 5:57 PM|Barron's: GM stock looks dirt cheap

 
GM is seeing strong results on the sales floor, and with a rock-bottom valuation and 3.3% yield, shares could rise 30%, according to a Barron's profile. Investors who look beyond the recall headlines will find much to like in GM, Jack Hough writes: U.S. light vehicle sales are the strongest since summer 2006, Europe's besieged car market has begun to recover with nine straight months of growth, and overall market share rose to 18.9% in June from 17.8% in May thanks to strong sales of SUVs and crossovers. GM will struggle to top $3 in EPS this year after recall costs and other expenses, but next year it could earn $5, with two-thirds of the increase coming from simply moving past one-time costs, Sterne Agee says; if that's right, GM  now trades at 7.5x next year's earnings, an 18% discount to Ford (NYSE:F) and a 50% discount to the market. |Jul. 11, 2014, 10:52 AM|New NHTSA probe covers 500K Ford vehicles

Production of the aluminum-bodied pickup starts this summer. What to watch: Early testing of the F-150 has gone well, according to the automaker.

Alcoa (AA) shares hit a 52-week high today amid reports that Ford's (F) lightweight Fusion concept car could provide a profound impact on aluminum demand and aluminum producers’ profits.
The prototype unveiled Tuesday is ~800 pounds,  or 25%, lighter than the regular Fusion model due to increased use of aluminum; Ford isn't selling the car for now, in  part because the lighter materials are more expensive, but Sterne Agee says the vehicle confirms its "thesis of the automotive industry  moving down an aluminum adoption curve beyond expectations."
Given the momentum of automotive aluminum announcements over the last  six months, Sterne Agee believes industry estimates for ~1.2M tons of  automotive aluminum sheet usage by 2025 - as well  as Alcoa's $1.3B revenue assumption for 2018 - are "very conservative."

General Motors (GM) bested estimates with a 6.9% gain, while Ford (F) had a strong pace of truck sales although car sales came in light. Pricing and incentives: The industry averaged $2,751 in incentives per vehicle in April, up 8.9% Y/Y and 1% M/M. Japanese automakers (HYMLF, HMC, NSANY) led the promotional charge. The average transaction price was estimated to be 1.2% higher at $32,141. Detroit automakers saw solid pricing trends in most segments. Trucks: Sales gains at most major automakers were paced by strong demand for pickup trucks. Gains at Ford (8%), Nissan (10.5%), and Chrysler (34%) stood out. 2014 forecast: Demand in April was strong enough to keep a sales forecast for +16M units  for the year in place. New models continue to sell well, but inventory levels will be closely watched as investments continue to pour into North American factories. CEO transition: Ford handed the reigns to Mark Fields a bit sooner than anticipated today. Wall Street analysts see a smooth transition with Fields strongly aligned with the course already laid out by Alan Mulally. "It's a story of continuity," Fields told reporters today.

 The EPA says the average fuel efficiency of vehicles in the U.S. improved to 24 mpg last year. Subaru (FUJHY), Volkswagen (VLKAY), and Mazda (MZDAY) topped the list with fleet-wide averages of 26 mpg or better. Chrysler (FIATY), General Motors (GM), and Ford (F) all fell below the industry average due to their higher mix of pickups trucks, while Daimler (DDAIF) kept luxury a priority over slashing weight. Tesla Motors (TSLA) boasts a gaudy equivalent efficiency rating of 89 mpg, but didn't sell enough cars to land in the rankings. What to watch: The U.S. government wants each automaker to boast a fleet average of 54.5 mpg or better by 2025. If those regulations stands, it will create a need for a higher mix of vehicles powered by electric and fuel cell technology as moves like Ford's to build F-150s with aluminum won't be enough to swing the averages far enough north. |Apr. 28, 2014, 8:16 AM|Kelley Blue Book: U.S. auto sales to rise 10% in April

A common thread between the spate of recent recalls and the line of reasoning behind the MS downgrade is the need for automobile manufacturers to upgrade and integrate technology inside of vehicles. There's a disparity on the design side between risk-tolerant tech firms and risk-averse automobile companies that could worsen as software fixes become part of the recall atmosphere.

Autodata reports that the average discount on a Chevrolet Silverado rose $500 M/M to $4,218 - compared to the $2,835 that Ford offered to potential F-Series buyers. |Mar. 5, 2014, 7:17 AM|Ford ramps up R&D in China

 Ford (F) plans to ramp research and development in China as it stays on a pace to sell more than one million vehicles in the region. The automaker will add new facilities and increase headcount by 50% to close to 2K by 2018. The goal of the initiative is to integrate "local customer insight" into product designs. |Mar. 4, 2014, 1:53 PM|Highlights from the Geneva Motor Show

 The overall tone at the Geneva Motor Show is positive as sales patterns in Europe have stabilized and even shown some pockets of strength. Perhaps the biggest question is if the sales gains are organic or the results of heavy discounting? Autohaus PulsSchlag reports price cuts of at least 10% at most major manufacturers. European automakers are downplaying the impact on sales in Russia from the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Russia is Europe's second largest automobile market and is expected to pass Germany within a few years. Jeep unveiled its all-new 2015 Renegade compact crossover SUV. The model is unique in that it will feature seven different engine choices tailored to different global markets. BMW announced plans to build over ten new smaller models on its latest platform.

 Ford (F) COO Mark Fields issues a warning at the Geneva Motor Show on the pace of investment by the industry in the BRIC nations. Global automakers may have built up too much capacity in emerging markets as regions such as India and Brazil continue to disappoint, notes Fields. Another factor is the recent turmoil in the Ukraine which could hurt auto sales in Russia after interest rates in the nation saw a sudden hike. The view of the heir apparent at Ford lines up with research by KPMG which indicates that by 2016 the global automotive market will have built up 20%-30% excess capacity.

 General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) have increased their level of discounting in order to drive traffic into showrooms, according to Reuters.

March and April could be the months that slimmer profits for GM and Ford unless pent-up demand is unleashed. |Feb. 27, 2014, 3:59 PM|Poor weather seen denting February U.S. auto sales, Edmunds says


New U.S. auto sales are expected to rise just 0.8% Y/Y in February, according to Edmunds.com, which expects to be hampered by poor winter weather for the second month in a row.
Edumnds estimates 1.2M new cars and trucks will be sold in the U.S. in February, up from slightly less than 1.2M a year ago and improving from January's total.
Among major auto makers, roughly 5% sales declines are projected for GM and Ford (F), with more modest sales drops seen at Toyota (TM) and Honda (HMC); Fiat Chrysler (FIATY) and Nissan (NSANY) are likely report double-digit sales increases, and Hyundai (HYMLF) sales are expected to rise 2%.

 Automobile sales made an impressive jump in the second week of February, according to data compiled by J.D. Power. Winter storms had auto sales for the month tracking 5% lower than a year ago, but a strong bounce has now cut the falloff to closer to 1%. A monthly forecast for 15.7M vehicles delivered is back on track with more late-month momentum expected. Perhaps of equal importance, pricing has held up with the average transaction price of $29.9K looking good for a challenging month to get potential buyers onto dealer lots. What to watch: Analysts know February alone won't solve the inventory issue of the Big Three (GM, F, FIATY), but an improving trend needs to be confirmed to alleviate concerns. The month will also give a good read on several head-to-head model battles between Toyota (TM) and Honda (HMC). |Feb. 21, 2014, 4:55 AM|GM, Ford optimistic about China

 General Motors (GM) is "working hard" to increase sales in China by 10% or more this year, says Matt Tsien, the President of the car-maker's operations in the country. Such growth would take sales to almost 3.5M vehicles from 3.16M in 2013. Ford (F) is way behind GM in China, although it expects to top 1M vehicle sales this year after the company and its joint ventures sold 935,813 units last year.

 Shares of General Motors (GM +0.7%) and Ford (F +0.5%) are both mild out-performers after GM announces it will use aluminum in future truck lines. GM is expected to reap some significant long-term benefits from its move, while Ford's aluminum play doesn't look as risky with its rival following its tracks.
Automobile industry analysts are split on which automaker is set up to see the largest gains: Ford has a huge head start and the F-150 brand juggernaut in its favor, while GM has scale and a production tech advantage. |Feb. 18, 2014, 7:21 PM|GM follows Ford, steps up effort to use aluminum in high-volume pickups



GM is accelerating efforts to field a largely aluminum-bodied next-generation pickup truck by late 2018, recently locking in supply contracts with Alcoa (AA) and Novelis which are now working to increase their aluminum sheet production to supply the GM pickup, WSJ reports.
The push to develop an aluminum intensive large pickup marks an apparent change of direction for GM; before Ford (F) unveiled its 2015 F-150 with a body made almost entirely of aluminum, GM execs had questioned whether such a vehicle could be cost competitive or appealing to U.S. customers.
GM is said to believe it can offset Ford's head start by using more advanced welding techniques to produce a lighter, stronger and easier to assemble truck.

It's a big risk: F-Series trucks - which include the F-150 and heavier duty models like  the F-250 - have been the best-selling vehicles in the U.S. for the last  32 years, and Ford makes ~$10K profit on every F-Series truck it sells.
The 2015 F-150 goes on sale late this year; although aluminum is more  expensive that steel, Ford says the  truck will stay within the current price range.

Will customers accept the change? "Trucks are put to such hard use. They take bangs and dings and a lot of hard use," says a somewhat skeptical Kelley Blue Book editorial director Jack Nerad. "We'll see." |Jan. 13, 2014, 8:29 AM|Ford hits the stage at Detroit Auto Show

 Ford's (F) CEO Alan Mulally exudes confidence in his press conference at the Detroit Auto Show. The exec says the portfolio of vehicles offered by the automaker in 2014 will be the most balanced in its history. In the next year, Ford expects to introduce 23 new models globally and strategically add plants in high-growth regions. The company brought the new Mustang out on the stage with its top management as it aims to use the iconic car as a brand-builder in new global markets.

 GM (GM) is set to unveil its new GMC Canyon later today, ahead of the official opening of Detroit Auto Show tomorrow. GM hopes that the redesigned vehicle, which is due to go on sale in Q3 along with the new Chevrolet Colorado, will pull sales from Ford's (F) F-150, Chrysler's (FIATY) Ram 1500 and Toyota's (TM) Tacoma, the market leader. GM acknowledged that the Canyon could also take minimal sales away from the company's larger Chevrolet Silverado, although execs aren't worried. GM abandoned the mid-sized segment in 2012 due to waning popularity. However, sales of mid-sized pick-ups are forecast to grow by more than a third, research firm LMC Automotive has estimated. |Jan. 10, 2014, 9:26 AM|Automakers dazzle at CES, but what about privacy?

 The intersection of technology and the automobile industry was on full display this week at the Consumer Electronics Show where a record number of automakers presented. Though the sneak peek at the new gadgetry and the evolution of on-board systems was quite impressive, there's a bit of backlash building on privacy issues. As more mobile devices connect to cars, and Google's Open Automototive Alliance and GM's OnStar system evolve, hyper-local marketing could take off. It's a gray area with few legal precedents, note privacy advocates. A Ford exec probably got a little too fired up at CES earlier this week with this comment: "We know everyone who breaks the law, we know when you're doing it.

 Ford (F) is taking the game right to Toyota (TM) with the re-introduction of the Fiesta model in Japan to compete directly with models from local brands. The automaker has struggled in Japan in the past and only sold 3.5K vehicles in the nation last year, but thinks the Fiesta can fill a role in the market.

 Despite some recent concerns on the U.S. automobile industry - including high inventory at General Motors (GM) and pricing pressures at Ford (F) -  the industry is in the best shape that it's been in years, say some analysts. On demand: The average age of vehicles in the U.S. has never been higher at 11.3 years. Some pent-up demand from the fall when government shutdown worries stalled sales is also still being unleashed. On profits: Though a high level of promotional activity in December helped to juice sales figures at the expense of profits, some underlying positive trends remain in place. The increased use of domestic production in supply chains and the early success of 2014 models at premium pricing bodes well for bottom lines in the sector. On leased cars: Analysts think the lease cycle sets up well for the industry in 2014.Toyota (TM) has aggressive leasing plans in place. On gas mileage: Consumers will be tempted to trade into new vehicles with vastly improved gas mileage ratings. Honda (HMC) tops the list while Ford's betting truck owners will go for a lighter F-150 in the future. In the luxury segment, Tesla (TSLA) and Mercedes-Benz (DDAIF) want to carve out more EV market share by reeling in middle-class buyers trading up while cutting down on gas costs.
On brand reputation: Automakers such as Subaru (FUJHY) and Chrysler (FIATY) have seen consumer sentiment scores turn around as new models impress. |Dec. 26, 2013, 8:13 AM|Forecast: U.S. auto sales to be strong on stable pricing

 IHS Automotive forecasts light-vehicle sales in North America will top 16M in 2014.

Nomura's Rick Sherlund, who not long ago predicted Mulally would be Microsoft's next CEO, now wonders if the Bill Gates quote included in Thompson's remarks indicates "the board is rethinking the role and looking more exhaustively at candidates from the technology field."
Moreover, if reports about Ford's board pressing Mulally to give "a definitive answer" regarding his future plans are accurate, Sherlund thinks "he might need to pull his hat out of the ring at some point soon."
Like others on the Street, he's worried a CEO with an IT background won't be as "shareholder-friendly" as Mulally. Sherlund has previously suggested Mulally might cut costs, boost capital returns, and unload Xbox and Bing.
However, FBR's Daniel Ives still thinks Mulally has a shot. He observes today's Ford business update contained no discussion of Mulally's plans, as many expected.

 The age-old battle between the Ford (F) Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro takes a new twist tomorrow when the redesigned Mustang is unleashed in global markets. By market share, Camaro has raced past Mustang, but the iconic car also has a "halo" effect which has helped the Ford brand.

 Though it's clear that automobile sales in the U.S. are booming as the industry brushed aside a tough Superstorm Sandy-boosted comparison to topple the sales estimates of analysts, the level of promotional activity used to pull off the feat is up for debate Truecar.com estimates the average transaction price for major automakers declined by 0.6% Y/Y to $30,634. However, a survey by Kelley Blue Book shows General Motors (GM -3.4%) and Nissan (NSANY -0.8%) were able to raise their average sale price in November compared to a year ago. Execs with Ford (F -3.2%) and Volkswagen (VLKAY -2.1%) both cited increased incentive activity during the month, but an increase in the mix of high-margin truck sales at many automakers could counterbalance the promotional fever.

On production, Ford says it will build 770K vehicles in Q1 of 2014 in North America, lower than last year's level of 784K.

 Automakers are walking a tightrope between accounting for strong demand in the U.S. and keeping inventory at levels where they don't have to use painful incentives to clear dealer lots. The industry entered November with inventory of 3.4M cars which at 76 days' supply reps the highest level for the month since 2005.

But COO Kevin Turner, ex-Skype CEO Tony Bates, and Stephen Elop are also said to be in the running.
Meanwhile, Microsoft is holding its annual meeting today. The departing Steve Ballmer defended his company's investments in Xbox and Bing (a successor might have a different take), which some analysts/investors have called on the software giant to unload.

 Major automobile companies are making a big mistake in thinking they can increase profit margins by taking on German automakers (BAMXY.PK, VLKAY.PK, DDAIF.PK) in the luxury market on their home turf, argues Neil Winston of The Detroit News. The "delusional" strategy to invest in the high-end market - instead of slashing capacity and following the lead of the successful South Korean automakers (KIMTF.PK, HYMLF.PK) in Europe - has proven disastrous to automakers such as Saab, Renault (RNSDF.PK), and Volvo (VLKAY.PK) in the past. Peugeot (GM, PEUGF.PK) and Ford (F) are guilty of falling for the temptation to move more models into the European upscale market, while Fiat (FIATY.PK) is playing small ball on the continent. |Oct. 10, 2013, 9:36 AM|Ford Motor Company declares $0.10 dividend

While the pace of annualized vehicle sales is running less than 2M shy of 2005's record 17.5M pace, WSJ notes that the industry employs far fewer works now than eight years ago, (647,600 workers last year versus 925,700 in 2005).
Agreements struck with unions have allowed the Big Three to add shifts and work their factories on nights and weekends.
Some say the industry is bumping up against the upper limits of production and will be forced to increase capacity by expanding plants or building new factories.
Nonsense, says Ford VP James Tetreault: "As a manufacturing guy, I never say we're maxed out."

 The Environmental Protection Agency says it will update rules on miles-per-gallon claims in response to disparities cropping up with hybrid and electric vehicles Ford (F) and Hyundai (HYMLF.PK) have both had to adjust mileage claims on models in the recent past. |Aug. 15, 2013, 4:43 PM|Ford lowers fuel economy claims for C-Max hybrid


Ford (F) lowers the fuel economy rating for its C-Max hybrid in response to complaints from consumers and an EPA investigation that its mileage falls short of claims.
Ford apparently won't be reprimanded by the EPA after following the agency's protocol for testing; the C-Max fuel economy rating is expected to be revised to 43 mpg from 47.
The decision to restate the mileage hurts Ford's efforts to compete with Toyota (TM) for consumers seeking high-mileage hybrid cars; TM is the top seller of hybrids, primarily through its Prius lineup, while Ford is no. 2 and has been gaining market share.

 Ford (F +0.4%) thinks it can lure younger buyers to new Lincoln models due to the heavy reliance on tech features and a slick redesign of the venerable brand. As part of Ford's renewed focus on Lincoln, dealers will be trained on how to appeal to the "progressive luxury" buyers it seeks to jumpstart the brand. The big picture: Though only accounting for about 3% of Ford's U.S. sales last year, Lincoln's contribution to the automaker's bottom line was significant. |Aug. 12, 2013, 8:11 AM|Subcompact war to heat up

 Japanese automakers (NSANY.OB, TM, HMC, MZDAY.PK, SZKMY.PK) want to take back subcompact market share lost to Ford (F) and Chevrolet (GM) in the U.S. after the Detroit automakers turned the tables on a segment once dominated by the group.

 Ford's (F +0.4%) Russian JV plans to scale back production at its plant near St. Petersburg, as demand for the compact cars made there has fallen sharply. The factory, which has capacity for 125K cars/year and employs 3K people, produces the Ford Focus, but "changes in customer demand with shifts between market segments" has resulted in a 16% decline this year in the compact car segment in which the Focus is a top seller among foreign brands. Ford sales in Russia are down 6% this year vs. last year's record pace of 2.93M new cars sold.

 The U.S. might end a 50-year tariff on pickup trucks with the measure seen contributing to higher prices for consumers. Toyota (TM), Nissan (NSANY.OB), and Honda (HMC) already avoid the tariff by building trucks on U.S. soil, but other automakers have tread somewhat lightly in the U.S. in the truck segment. The Big Three (GM, F, FIATY.PK) have built up so much brand loyalty for their popular truck models that ending the tariff probably won't hurt the trio, and could actually help them raise sales if other markets like Japan are opened up as a counter-measure. |Aug. 2, 2013, 8:16 AM|Ford sells $1B in 10-year bonds

 Double-digit gains were the norm for July with the Big Three (GM, F, FIATY.PK) posting a big month and a pair of Japanese automakers - Subaru (FUJHY.PK) and Honda (HMC) - topping the 20% sales growth mark. Toyota (TM) recorded a strong enough month to pass Ford in deliveries for the first time in several years per Autodata. Despite some analysts thinking U.S. consumers would deliver a few more sales, strong retail traffic and a controlled level of inventory in a soft spot for new model introductions sets up very well for the rest of H2.
