 Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) has asked Guyana's government for a production license  to let it start pumping oil from the seabed by late 2019, in the country's first-ever oil and gas license, the Geology and Mines Commissioner says.XOM also has submitted its general production plan alongside its production permit application, the official says; XOM so far has drilled five wells and is now completing work on a sixth, with one coming up dry so far. XOM said last year that exploratory wells off Guyana discovered a  "world-class" reservoir that could hold up to 1.4B barrels of  oil; two weeks ago, XOM said it expects Guyana production to start by 2020. |Yesterday, 1:10 PM|Reuters: Trump seeks energy company input on Paris climate pact

 The Trump administration has been contacting U.S. energy companies to ask them about their views on the U.N. global climate accord, Reuters reports, in a possible sign that Trump is reconsidering his 2016 campaign pledge to back out of the deal. Many of the companies reportedly reached by the administration - including Exxon Mobil (XOM +0.6%) and ConocoPhillips (COP +0.9%) - had said previously that they would prefer the U.S. remain in the pact, but also would support reducing the U.S. commitments in the deal. As part of the agreement reached in 2015 by nearly 200 countries meeting in Paris, the U.S. committed to reducing its emissions by 26%-28% below 2005 levels by 2025.ETFs: XLE, VDE, ERX, OIH, XOP, FCG, ERY, GASL, DIG, DUG, BGR, XES, IYE, IEO, FENY, IEZ, PXE, GASX, FIF, PXJ, RYE, NDP, GUSH, DRIP, DDG, FXN, CRAK |Yesterday, 11:42 AM|Australia gets commitments from gas producers to boost local supply

 Australia's top gas producers, led by Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), pledge to increase domestic gas production in Australia as Prime  Minister Turnbull threatens to impose restrictions on gas exports in an effort to solve a supply shortfall that threatens the country’s energy security. The government says the commitments mean that Australia will avoid a projected shortfall of gas-powered electricity generation in the summer of 2018-19. The pledges come shortly after Australia's energy market operator warned the country faces a gas crunch from 2019 that could trigger supply cuts to industry or power outages for lack of gas for generation, even as Australia is on track to become the world's top exporter of liquefied natural gas. The growing alarm at the prospect of further blackouts across South Australia prompted Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) Elon Musk last week to offer his company's energy storage technology as a solution to the area's energy problems. |Yesterday, 9:58 AM|Iraq talking with Exxon to develop new southern oilfields

 Iraq's talks with Exxon Mobil (XOM +0.4%) to develop two small southern oilfields are progressing well, the head of state-run South Oil Co. says.

 The New York attorney general's office will seek to question Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) executives under oath as part of its investigation into the company’s statements about climate change after discovering an email alias used by former CEO Rex Tillerson. Tillerson used the name Wayne Tracker for his secondary internal email account at XOM when sending some sensitive messages to and from board members, AG Eric Schneiderman revealed earlier this week; the company says the alias was set up because Tillerson's primary account was stuffed with too many messages. The discovery of the alias address increases the likelihood that Tillerson will be among those questioned under oath in the case, former Massachusetts assistant district attorney Jon Barooshian tells Bloomberg. Justice Barry Ostrager in New York state court in Manhattan, who has been overseeing the case, must decide whether to schedule a hearing on the matter.|Yesterday, 3:05 AM|Exxon clarifies Tillerson's email alias

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, while CEO of Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), used an alias for emails with employees and board members because his primary account was jammed with too many messages."This was not an alias used to discuss only climate change," said Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers. He received thousands of emails a day at his regular address and that made it difficult to parse which messages were important.Previously: Tillerson used alias email at Exxon to discuss climate change, NY AG says (Mar. 13 2017)|Tue, Mar. 14, 12:45 PM|Energy drags averages lower, weighed by sinking crude oil

 Former Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) CEO and current U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson used an email alias to discuss risk management issues related to climate change from at least 2008 to 2015, the New York attorney general says. AG Eric Schneiderman makes the claim in a letter to the NY Supreme Court, accusing XOM of failing to turn over all relevant documents required by a court order. XOM acknowledges the emails containing the pseudonym, but says it has provided more than 2.5M pages of documents in response to a subpoena from Schneiderman’s office, and will respond to the specific claims in court. The news comes amid a legal conflict in which XOM seeks to stop probes by New York and Massachusetts into whether the company misled investors for years about the possible impact of climate change on its business.|Sat, Mar. 11, 8:25 AM|Energy execs stress "efficiency" as key to new projects, fears of new oil rout

 The big buzzword this week at the CERAWeek energy conference was "efficiency" - and how too much of a good thing could turn out bad. From Exxon Mobil's (NYSE:XOM) Darren Woods to Statoil's (NYSE:STO) Eldar Saetre, nearly every executive talked about lower breakeven prices; for some new projects tying back to existing facilities, execs said they could avoid losses at as low as $12/bbl. Wael Sawan, the head of Shell’s (RDS.A, RDS.B) deepwater business, said the company had cut the cost of its wells by 50% over two years, mostly because it now uses four standard well designs worldwide vs. dozens previously. With costs down, companies are starting to approve more investment: Bob Dudley said BP would bring on more projects this year than ever, Total (NYSE:TOT) CEO Patrick Pouyanne said his company plans to approve as many as 10 big projects in the next 18 months, and shale firms such as EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) and RSP Permian (NYSE:RSPP) said they expected to boost annual production by 20%-30% over several years. Amid all the optimism came some warnings: Pioneer Natural Resources' (NYSE:PXD) Scott Sheffield said prices could fall to $40/bbl if OPEC fails to extend its output agreement, and Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR) CEO Harold Hamm warned that undisciplined growth could "kill" the oil market. Although several reasons may explain why oil prices plunged this week, including another build in U.S. crude stockpiles, at least part of the drop surely was attributable to the CERAWeek talk on breakeven prices. |Fri, Mar. 10, 5:13 PM|Analysts see little credibility in Exxon-for-BP takeover chatter

 BP raced to its best gain of the year in today's trade, +2.5% in reaction to a London rumor that Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) was sounding out major shareholders about a potential takeover. Reports about XOM's supposed interest in BP have popped up from time to time for years, but most analysts believe a deal is unlikely; Tudor Pickering's Anish Kapadia says the combined company would be "potentially too big and complex to be manageable.” As well as the sheer size of a deal, a buyer of BP might be forced to accelerate the payment of as much as two-thirds of the $20B-plus in penalties levied for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, which Kapadia says "may not be what someone would want to take on." “There’s nothing unique about BP that Exxon can’t get something similar by just buying single assets," says Macquarie's Iain Reed. Such a combination also likely would attract the attention of antitrust regulators around the world, particularly in the U.K. “given the excitable nature of British domestic politics at the moment," Canaccord's Alex Brooks says. |Fri, Mar. 10, 12:55 PM|Tillerson recuses himself from Keystone pipeline review

 Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has recused himself from issues related to TransCanada's (TRP +0.6%) application for a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline. Tillerson had recused himself in February, the State Department said yesterday in a letter responding to a demand from Greenpeace, which argued that his former emplyer, Exxon Mobil (XOM -0.2%), would "directly and predictably" benefit from Keystone's approval because the company has investments in Canadian oil sands.

 Market rumors in London say Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) has reached out to major BP shareholders regarding a potential takeover, the U.K.'s Evening Standard reports. XOM and BP have several top shareholders in common, including BlackRock and Vanguard, and according to the chatter, BP is concerned impatient shareholders will  urge it to do a deal if it cannot create value on its own, much like  Unilever’s decision to launch a review of options after rejecting Kraft Heinz’s bid. In another twist, Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, [RDS.B]]) supposedly would be prepared to swoop in with its own bid to save the day and keep BP on British soil if XOM makes an approach.BP +2.4% premarket. |Thu, Mar. 9, 6:38 PM|Venezuela lawyer says $1.4B Exxon damage award overturned

 Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) rose 2.1% today for its biggest gain since mid-December, thanks to the upbeat outlook presented at its annual analyst day, as new CEO Darren Woods did not announce any major shift in strategy but exuded confidence in offering details of the company’s ambitious investment plans through the end of the decade - particularly in U.S. shale, where the company is a late-comer. Woods said U.S. shale will absorb half of XOM’s worldwide drilling budget in 2018, with production from shale wells growing an average of 20%/year through 2025; the company plans to spend more than $5.5B this year to drill wells in the Permian and Bakken shale regions, among other so-called short-cycle assets. “The ultimate prize in the Permian is significant,” Woods said, noting that the land XOM controls in the play may hold 6B equivalent barrels of oil and natural gas. Woods was effective today in laying out the story, but he was "hamstrung  by his predecessor's mistakes and the market's increasingly skeptical  sentiment on the stock," Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov says.Cowen analysts say XOM still needs M&A to move the needle, given  that XOM’s “size and scale creates reserve replacement challenges that  continue to outweigh positive exploration developments." |Wed, Mar. 1, 11:29 AM|Eni close to finalizing deal to sell stake in Mozambique gas field, CEO says

 Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) will host its annual analyst day tomorrow, but Credit Suisse analysts do not expect a catalyst coming out of the event that will lift its lagging shares. But Credit Suisse does see XOM's free cash flow improving over time, as the company enjoys one of the highest share of longer lived cash flows among the oil majors, and the ability to offset upstream decline through capital efficient shale, tiebacks, low cost greenfield e.g. Guyana, and lowest cost LNG/oil sands.The firm believes that if XOM can hold onto the cost savings from 2016, deliver Permian growth and maintain capex control in the legacy assets, then the unlevered free cash flow yield could rise toward 6.5%.Credit Suisse also says XOM's 3.8% dividend yield is well covered, and the company can grow the dividend over time; XOM dividend hikes normally come just ahead of Q1 results, the firm adds. |Mon, Feb. 27, 8:23 AM|Reuters: Algeria's Sonatrach in talks to begin offshore drilling

 Losing a net 3.3B barrels of reserves actually is good news for Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), as it provides an opportunity for the company to attack its biggest problem - an obsession with bigness - Bloomberg's Liam Denning writes. Denning says Rex Tillerson left XOM with lemons: About half the company's projects scheduled for 2018 onward consist of oil sands and liquefied natural gas, neither of which look economical absent a sustained increase in oil prices. When Darren Woods presides next week over his first analyst day as CEO, Denning says he should emphasize a decisive break with the past decade by committing to keep capex flat for the next few years and to pull back in certain traditional areas such as oil sands in favor of assets with better economics or more flexible production, such as more shale. "Being big is no longer the biggest idea out there," Denning concludes. "Access to profitable production providing cash for distributions, rather than reserves and growth per se, is what counts - even if it means being flexible on traditionally non-negotiable things [such as] formal ownership of reserves." |Thu, Feb. 23, 7:10 PM|New Exxon CEO endorses carbon tax, mirroring Tillerson's view

XOM also says it plans $22B in capex for 2017, up 14% Y/Y (which marked a 35% decline) from $19.3B, which the company said in its earnings conference call was not due to rising prices for oilfield contract work or other services,. XOM also signals that it likely will recognize that as much as 4.6B barrels of its reserves, predominantly in Canada’s oil sands, are not profitable to produce, according to SEC rules; in its Q4 results, the company wrote down the value of more than $2B in U.S. assets.|Tue, Jan. 31, 8:48 AM|Exxon little changed premarket as Q4 earnings miss, revenue rises

 Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) +0.1% premarket after posting a large Q4 earnings miss, taking a $2B impairment charge related to dry gas operations with undeveloped acreage in the Rocky Mountains region. The impairment resulted from XOM's review of its reserves, after the company had warned it would need to revise the amount of unproduced resources it holds if oil prices remained low through year-end; XOM said at the time that the resources likely would no longer qualify as proven reserves under SEC rules. Excluding the impairment, Q4 earnings rose to $3.7B, due to higher liquids realizations partly offset by weaker refining margins; revenue rose 2% Y/Y to $61B, the first increase in many quarters. XOM's upstream business posted a $642M loss, including the $2B impairment; excluding the charge, earnings were $1.4B, up from $528M in the year-ago quarter the year before: U.S. upstream lost $2.32B vs. a $538M loss a year  earlier. Q4 downstream earnings totaled $1.2B, down $110M from a year ago, due to weaker refining and marketing margins; U.S. downstream earnings were $270M, down $165M from Q4 2015. Q4 global production totaled 4.12M boe/day vs. 3.81M boe/day in the prior quarter and 4.23M a year ago; liquids production of 2.38M bbl/day rose from 2.23M in the prior quarter, while gas production of 10.42B cf/day fell from 10.6B cf/day in the year-ago quarter. |Tue, Jan. 31, 8:02 AM|Exxon Mobil EPS of $0.41

 Exxon Mobil's (XOM -0.3%) giant Liza discovery offshore Guyana will have an average production of 100K bbl/day of oil when it begins flowing in 2020, according to the company's country manager speaking at a Trinidad and Tobago energy conference. XOM says it plans to use a FPSO unit to produce the oil and then export it, and is confident of meeting the early start-up deadline because of the use of “cutting edge” technology. XOM is operator and holds a 45% interest in the Stabroek block that contains the Liza discovery, while Hess (HES -2.7%) owns a 30% stake and Cnooc's (CEO -0.9%) Nexen has 25%. |Thu, Jan. 26, 11:48 AM|Reuters: Australia's LNG projects face big delays, benefiting Cheniere, Exxon

 Australia's plans for a huge increase in its production of liquefied natural gas are hurting from a series of production delays, as at least three of the country's major projects - Shell’s (RDS.A -1.2%) Prelude floating  LNG production vessel, the expansion of Chevron’s (CVX -0.6%) Gorgon operation, and Inpex's Ichtys project - likely will not begin exporting until 2018 or even later, rather than 2017 as previously planned, Reuters reports. Australia remains likely to become the  world's top LNG exporter, dispatching ~85M metric tons/year by the end of the decade, up from 30.7M tons in 2015 and 45.1M in 2016, but the pace of growth is much slower than  expected because of technical problems and cost overruns that have delayed plans to start or increase LNG exports from the projects, according to the report. Neil Beveridge, oil and gas analyst at Alliance Bernstein, says "the returns of many of the projects are going to be low and probably lower than the cost of capital in the current oil price environment." Traders say the biggest beneficiaries include Cheniere Energy (LNG +2.7%), with its facility at Sabine Pass in the Gulf of Mexico, and Exxon Mobil (XOM -0.1%), with its production in Papua New Guinea. |Wed, Jan. 25, 7:12 PM|Exxon names atmospheric scientist Avery to its board

 Oil and gas discoveries around the world fell last year to just over 6B boe, the lowest since the 1940s, after companies reduced their search for new resources amid falling oil prices, according to the Rystad Energy consultancy. The decline in discoveries means companies such as Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) are likely to struggle to offset the natural depletion of existing fields, reinforcing forecasts of a supply shortage by the end of the decade, Rystad says. Companies were able on average to replace only 10% of their oil and liquid gas reserves last year, compared with a reserve replacement ratio of 30% in 2013, and the number of exploration wells drilled fell by 40% from 2014 when oil prices began their sharp decline.ETFs: USO, OIL, UWT, UCO, DWT, SCO, BNO, DBO, DTO, USL, DNO, OLO, SZO, OLEM|Tue, Jan. 17, 9:09 AM|Exxon to buy companies doubling Permian Basin resource to 6B barrels

 Former Exxon Mobil (XOM +0.2%) CEO and secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson may have to testify on the day before Pres.-elect Trump's inauguration in a lawsuit that claims the U.S. government failed to protect future generations from global warming. The suit was brought by a group of youth plaintiffs, although several fossil fuel industry groups have legally intervened on the defense’s side, including the American Petroleum Institute. The lead attorney tells Business Insider that the plaintiffs' questions will focus on what XOM scientists knew about climate change and for how long; Tillerson sidestepped similar questions posed during his confirmation hearing, but likely would need to be far more forthcoming when under oath in a federal lawsuit. |Fri, Jan. 13, 8:22 AM|Exxon, PetroVietnam sign gas generation deal

 Exxon Mobil (XOM -0.6%) reports positive results from its Payara-1 well offshore Guyana, encountering more than 95 ft. of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs. The discovery is XOM's second off the coast of Guyana, in a another reservoir 10 miles from the Liza field discovered in 2015, which is estimated to contain 100M-150M boe. In addition to the Payara discovery, XOM says appraisal drilling at the Liza-3 well has identified an additional high quality, deeper reservoir directly below  the Liza field, which is being evaluated for development.

Pres.-elect Trump once suggested that climate change was a hoax created by the Chinese to help make U.S. manufacturing less competitive. Tillerson also appeared to differ from Trump’s promise to tear up the Paris Agreement on reducing global emissions, but noted Trump's "America first" policy and said participation in global climate agreements may be subject to  considerations about their impact on U.S. business. The former CEO declined to address XOM’s past positions on climate change; the company potentially could face legal or investor sanctions given some ongoing state investigations. |Wed, Jan. 11, 10:38 AM|Exxon downgraded at Wells Fargo as acquisition window closes

The court was responding to requests for a preliminary injunction against the June decision, opposed by groups who sought a halt or a deeper cut to production at Groningen. Output has been cut several times from 53.9B cm in 2013 amid criticism that Dutch authorities had failed to adequately assess the risk to citizens from earthquakes caused by gas production. Groningen is operated by a joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM).|Thu, Jan. 5, 8:03 AM|Exxon's Tillerson discloses global assets of as much as $400M

 Rex Tillerson, likely the next U.S. secretary of state and chairman and CEO of Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) until Jan. 1, disclosed assets worth as much as $400M in an ethics filing that reflected investments spanning more than a dozen countries. XOM has said Tillerson would receive a ~$180M payout in lieu of restricted stock awards that have yet to vest; in the ethics filing, Tillerson says the money would be placed in an irrevocable trust that would be managed by an independent trustee. Tillerson would recuse himself for a year from government decisions involving XOM, possibly including decisions over whether to ease sanctions placed on Russia; under Tillerson’s leadership, Russia became XOM’s single biggest exploration theater as the company amassed drilling rights across tens of millions of acres.Tillerson continues to own shares in Shell, Chevron, Total, Sinopec, Phillips 66, Schlumberger and GE; outside of energy, he holds stakes in Apple, Caterpillar and Deere.

 Chevron (CVX +0.6%) is upgraded to Outperform from Neutral with a $130 price target at Macquarie, saying OPEC production cuts put a floor on oil prices moving into 2017, which benefits CVX as one of the most oil-levered stocks among the majors.With most of CVX's operational issues now behind it and a restrained capital budget recently announced for 2017, the firm thinks CVX should be able to generate significant free cash flow in 2017, sufficient to cover its dividend. Macquarie remains cautious on Underperform-rated Exxon Mobil (XOM +0.1%), which it thinks still looks much too expensive vs. peers, although the free cash flow profile should improve significantly in 2017 due in part to its U.S. onshore production becoming more profitable. |Dec. 14, 2016, 7:45 PM|WSJ: Exxon faces Tillerson pay dilemma, as $175M award could spark criticism

 Now that Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) CEO Rex Tillerson is Pres.-elect Trump’s pick for secretary of state, the company board faces a difficult decision on how make a clean financial break, WSJ reports. The board is considering whether to grant Tillerson - who will step down at year's end to start his new job - more than $175M in stock compensation that he is currently eligible to receive only upon hitting the retirement age of 65 in March. Allowing Tillerson to retire early and cash out would be a break from XOM policy under which vesting occurs after a decade, and could open the company to criticism it is giving Tillerson a gift as he heads to a government post in which he could have influence over XOM’s fortunes.

Woods' selection was expected; he was promoted to president and the board of directors in December a year ago, and has been a member of XOM's six-person management  committee that oversees day-to-day operations since June 2014.Shares of XOM and most other energy producers have turned lower following the Fed's interest rate hike. |Dec. 13, 2016, 9:52 AM|President Darren Woods in line as likely Tillerson successor as Exxon CEO

 ExxonMobil (XOM +0.9%) opens with gains following news that Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson will be nominated for secretary of state; the company issues a statement saying its board "will be meeting shortly regarding transition." Darren Woods, XOM’s head of refining since 2012, appears to be in line to succeed Tillerson, who already was due to retire no later than March upon reaching the company's mandatory retirement age. Woods was promoted to president and the board of directors in December a year ago, and has been a member of XOM's six-person management committee that oversees day-to-day operations since June 2014. Refining has outperformed upstream operations for the past five quarters, a complete reversal of the traditional relationship; since June 2015, XOM’s refineries and related business lines accumulated $6.34B vs. $3.05B for the oil and gas business, while refining capital spending totaled $3.1B vs. $22.9B in upstream.|Dec. 13, 2016, 2:16 AM|Trump to name SecState Tuesday

 Pres.-elect Trump's reportedly imminent selection (I, II) of Exxon Mobil's (NYSE:XOM) Rex Tillerson as his secretary of state may not be so imminent after all, after some Republican U.S. senators signaled that the CEO could have trouble winning confirmation because of his ties to Vladimir Putin. Criticism over the weekend from Senators including Rubio and McCain, not to mention key Democrats, suggest that nominating Tillerson could become a messy distraction for the new president. A Kremlin spokesperson today was cautious on Tillerson's cabinet prospects but praised the CEO's personal qualities, but a consultant to Putin's staff called Tillerson, combined with presumptive defense secretary James Mattis and national security adviser Michael Flynn a "fantastic team," and a member of the Russian parliament said the choice of Tillerson would be "a sensation." Putin and Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin both consider Tillerson “a quintessential no-nonsense Texan with a  very businesslike attitude,” says Konstantin Von Eggert, a former XOM vice president in Russia. |Dec. 12, 2016, 4:59 PM|Judge cancels Massachusetts AG's Dallas deposition in Exxon case

 BP has the highest exposure in the countries that have said they will cut oil production, Rystad Energy says, with the likely participation of Russia, where BP holds a 20% stake in Rosneft (OTC:RNFTF), puts it ahead of rivals Total (NYSE:TOT), Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Eni (NYSE:E) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX). “If Russia should deliver on their production cut, we believe that the fields operated by Rosneft will be affected,” Rystad's Espen Erlingsen says. "Also in Iraq, the government will need to reduce production from the large Basra fields. Here the BP-operated Rumaila is a likely candidate for cuts.” BP has ~1.6M bbl/day of production in the affected countries, with Russia accounting for roughly half the total, according to the Rystad analysis; Total has ~700K bbl/day of output in the countries, Shell has 586K bbl/day, followed by XOM with 563K, Eni with 497K, and CVX 194K.|Dec. 6, 2016, 12:48 PM|Oil minister plays down landowner threats to operations at Exxon's PNG LNG

 Papua New Guinea's oil minister is playing down threats of disruptions to ExxonMobil's (XOM +0.1%) PNG LNG project due to landowners being unable to buy a stake in the project by the end of this year, and says the government could look at other options after year-end to help landowners if necessary. Under a 2009 agreement, local landowners had the option  to buy a 4.27% equity stake in the project by June 2016 - a deadline that was extended to Dec. 31 - but the landowners have not been able to line up the $640M needed to pay; landowners reportedly were "threatening to create chaos" last week after a state-owned firm withdrew plans to provide finance for the stake purchase. "The risks are real. We know weapons have been amassed by landowners," a project officer tells Reuters, but the oil minister does not expect any disruption, saying "The project is very important to the country's economic standing. We can't discredit our standing when there is a way forward." |Dec. 6, 2016, 11:10 AM|Exxon reportedly pulls out of three Kurdistan exploration blocks

XOM says the Beaumont project builds on supply advantages created by the expansion of its Mont Belvieu plastics plant in Texas, where two similar polyethylene units are being added; combined, the new Beaumont uniti will increase XOM's U.S. polyethylene production by 40%, or nearly 2M metric tons/year. XOM’s previously announced investments at Beaumont include expansion of the refinery’s crude refining capacity in 2015 and, earlier this year, construction of a new unit to increase domestic supply of ultra-low sulfur gasoline and diesel. |Nov. 14, 2016, 11:58 AM|Exxon adds New York to lawsuit in bid to stop climate change probe

 ExxonMobil (XOM -1.1%) adds New York's attorney general to the lawsuit it filed in June against the Massachusetts AG in a bid to stop an investigation into what the company knew about climate change. The company says the two attorneys general are “conducting improper and politically motivated investigations of Exxon Mobil in a coordinated effort to silence and intimidate one side of the public policy debate on how to address climate change." Massachusetts, New York and other states are investigating whether XOM violated securities laws and consumer protection rules by withholding information that man-made emissions were changing the climate.|Nov. 10, 2016, 6:49 PM|Exxon VP calls climate change “serious risk” in tweet

 Two days after Donald Trump won the White House, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) makes clear its position on  climate change, tweeting that “The Paris agreement is an important step forward by governments in addressing the serious risks of #ClimateChange.” Suzanne McCarron, XOM's VP of public and government affairs and author of the tweet,  linked to a statement that appeared to be written last week when the  company commended officials for the “entering into force” of the climate  deal.It's worth remembering that XOM is fighting with New York's attorney  general and others who want to force the company to hand over decades of documents  as part of a broad inquiry into its policies about  climate change risks. |Nov. 10, 2016, 8:22 AM|Sunoco Logistics, Exxon to combine pipeline assets in new joint venture

 Voters in California’s Monterey County yesterday passed a fracking ban that may shut down all oil production in the county after 70 years, marking the first time a U.S. county with relatively significant oil production has voted to ban fracking. Monterey County’s San Ardo field has produced an average 21.9K bbl/day of crude this year, ~4.4% of California’s overall 499K bbl/day of onshore output. A group funded largely by Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and a venture between ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) spent millions of dollars fighting the measure. Also, voters in Washington state rejected a  ballot initiative that would have created the first U.S. statewide  carbon emission tax on the sale or use of fossil fuels and fossil  fuel-generated electricity. |Nov. 9, 2016, 2:57 PM|Big Oil praises Trump victory, expects less red tape

 U.S. big energy stocks surge on Trump's victory, seeing an opportunity for more oil and gas production and to cut red tape that has held back billions of dollars of investment in new projects. The E&P industry is looking to Trump to "undo many of the onerous regulations that  have plagued our industry throughout an Obama presidency," says Continental Resources (CLR +3.9%) CEO Harold Hamm, who adds that the government's reluctance to lease federal land for drilling is holding back E&P firms. Trump may be considering Hamm as a possible energy secretary, in what would be the first time the job has been filled from the oil and gas industry since the position was created in 1977. ExxonMobil (XOM +1.2%) says it hoped Trump's administration would use "sound science" on future regulations, and ConocoPhillips (COP +3.5%) says it plans to work with Trump to protect the environment but also produce oil and gas needed to grow the economy.

 Nigeria's government has reached an outline settlement to resolve a dispute with western energy firms that would pay the companies $5B to cover exploration and production joint venture costs in the country, Financial Times reports. Nigeria's petroleum minister tells FT that Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Eni (NYSE:E), Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Total (NYSE:TOT) accepted the settlement of costs incurred during 2010-15, and hopes a deal can be finalized by year-end. The settlement, which would be a haircut on the $6B-plus the western companies claim they are owed by Nigeria, needs the approval of two government bodies and final signoff from Pres. Buhari.E&P costs are supposed to be split in the  partnerships between the two sides, but western companies have accused  Nigeria of failing to pay its portion of the expenses, which has  caused the companies to hold back on investment. |Nov. 7, 2016, 2:28 PM|InterOil rebounds as Exxon "fully supportive" of merger dealdeal

 InterOil (IOC +3.6%) recoups much of its Friday losses after seeking to reassure investors that its deal to be acquired by ExxonMobil (XOM +2.1%) is still alive and well despite a Canadian court's ruling that the deal was unfair to shareholders. IOC says XOM has advised that it remains fully supportive of the deal as the companies work through issues raised by the court's decision that overturned a previous ruling by the Yukon's Supreme Court to allow the deal to proceed. IOC says it is in discussions with XOM "with respect to  extending the outside date," and also is "considering options to file  for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada." |Nov. 4, 2016, 3:45 PM|InterOil -6% as Canada court sides with former CEO in merger dispute

IOC says the current deal represents compelling value for its shareholders, and that the two companies are determining a path to closing the transaction. Mulacek, who stepped down in 2013 but still owns IOC shares, has called the offer from XOM - which would see IOC shareholders receive $45/share of IOC paid in XOM shares - "vastly inadequate." |Nov. 3, 2016, 12:45 PM|Shell CFO says oil demand could peak in as little as five years

 Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) CFO Simon Henry says demand for oil could peak in as little as five years, an outlook that runs counter to the standard industry view that forecasts decades of growth. “We’ve long been of the opinion that demand will peak before supply,” Henry says, "and that peak may be somewhere between 5 and 15 years hence, and it will be driven by efficiency and substitution, more than offsetting the new demand for transport.” Shell will be in business for “many decades to come” because it is focusing more on natural gas and expanding its new-energy businesses including biofuels and hydrogen, Henry says. The consensus oil industry view recently was typified by Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), which said in its annual outlook that “global demand for oil and other liquids is projected to rise by about 20 percent from 2014 to 2040.” ETFs: USO, OIL, UWTI, UCO, DWTI, SCO, BNO, DBO, DTO, USL, DNO, OLO, SZO, OLEM|Nov. 3, 2016, 10:37 AM|WisdomTree Equity Income ETF (DHS) October Summary

Goldman sees a more favorable risk/reward in Chevron (NYSE:CVX), which is upgraded to its Conviction Buy List, after XOM reported another drop in quarterly profit and warned that it may be forced to recognize that billions of barrels of its reserves are no longer profitable to produce.

 ExxonMobil (XOM -1.2%) warns it may be facing the biggest reserves revision in its history, as it may be forced to recognize that as much as 4.6B barrels are no longer profitable to produce. XOM says ~3.6B barrels of reserves in the Canadian oil sands and the equivalent of another 1B barrels in other North American fields may be in jeopardy if the average YTD energy prices persist, which would equate to 19% of the company’s reserves. “The fact that everyone else has recorded charges and they have not created a red flag,” says Edward Jones analyst Brian Youngberg; XOM is under state and federal investigation for how it accounts for the value of its oil and gas wells. The disclosure comes as XOM's Q3 earnings declined for the eighth straight quarter and production hits seven-year lows, with Q3 output of  3.81M boe/day below analyst expectations of ~3.99M boe/day. |Oct. 28, 2016, 8:58 AM|ExxonMobil slips as earnings fall for eighth straight quarter

 ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) -1.6% premarket as it extends its consecutive declines in quarterly profit to eight, with Q3 earnings of $0.63/share vs. $1.01 in the year-ago quarter, but it was good enough to beat analyst expectations; revenues fell 13% Y/Y to $58.68B. XOM says the results reflect lower refining margins and commodity prices, and CEO Rex Tillerson says the operating environment "remains challenging." Q3 profit in the exploration and production, or upstream, business fell 16% Y/Y to $620M; in the U.S., upstream widened its loss to $477M from $442M a year ago.J.P. Morgan analysts Phil Gresh and John Royall anticipated $1.18B in upstream net income for the period. Q3 profit in the refining and marketing, or downstream, business fell 40% Y/Y to $1.2B; XOM says weaker margins, mostly in refining, weighed on segment earnings by $1.6B, while  volume and mix effects boosted earnings by $170M. XOM says ~3.6B barrels of reserves in the Canadian oil sands and another 1B boe in other North American fields may be written down if average YTD energy prices persist. |Oct. 28, 2016, 8:02 AM|Exxon Mobil beats by $0.05, misses on revenue

 ExxonMobil (XOM +0.2%) is considering building a full-scale trading division for the first time in its history, as it searches for new ways to boost profits during the oil price slump, Financial Times reports. The move would be a major change for a company that has deliberately shunned trading other producers’ oil, but the two-year oil downturn has prompted some XOM execs to consider the case for establishing a trading division that buys and sells other producers’ crude and refined products as well as its own, according to the report. The large trading divisions of BP, Royal Dutch Shell and Total have earned substantial profits during the downturn, which surely has caught the eye of XOM top brass. |Oct. 26, 2016, 6:57 PM|NY Supreme Court orders Exxon to comply with climate probe subpoena

 Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov has long been bearish on ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), and now he recommends the same advice for current InterOil (NYSE:IOC) shareholders following XOM's buyout: Sell. Molchanov says XOM is poorly positioned to take full advantage of a sustained oil price recovery, as the company's structural overweight to refining, chemicals, and (within upstream) non-LNG gas does not directly benefit from rising oil prices; he also says XOM shares already are pricing in long-term oil prices at an above-consensus WTI at $70/bbl. For current IOC shareholders, Molchanov says sell the post-buyout shares and use the proceeds to reinvest into any of a wide range of oil-levered stocks such as Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), Hess (NYSE:HES), Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) and Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL).

 ExxonMobil (XOM +0.7%) CEO Rex Tillerson, speaking directly after Saudi Arabian oil minister Khalid Al-Falih at the Oil & Money conference in London, offered a rebuke to the Saudis, saying fears of a future supply shortage are overblown. Tillerson said U.S. shale oil producers' resilience in cutting costs to make some wells profitable at as low as $40/bbl means that North American production has effectively become a swing producer that will be able to respond rapidly to any global supply shortage. Tillerson: "I don't quite share the same view that others have that we are somehow on the edge of a precipice. I think because we have confirmed viability of very large resource base in North America... that serves as enormous spare capacity in the system. It doesn't take mega-project dollars and it can be brought on line much more quickly than a 3-4 year project." His stance contrasted with al-Falih, who minutes earlier warned that the sector faces challenges due to the drop in long-term investment in the market, a reason the Saudis have cited in their recent move to push for a production cut.

 Kazakhstan's Energy Ministry says production will resume at the Kashagan  offshore oil field by early October, with initial output of 75K bbl/day and rising to 150K-180K bbl/day in November and December. The $50B Kashagan field in the Caspian Sea already was years behind schedule when it achieved first oil production in 2013, but operations were halted just a month later when a leak in a pipeline forced the whole project to shut down.

 ExxonMobil (XOM +0.1%) agrees to pay a $12M settlement related to environmental damages caused by a 2011 pipeline break that spilled 63K gallons of crude oil into Montana's Yellowstone River. Montana will receive $9.5M from the settlement, and the U.S. government will get $2.5M. The payment settles claims from the U.S. and state governments that the 2011 spill harmed natural resources as it fouled an 85-mile stretch of the river. XOM previously has said it spent $135M on cleanup and repair work, although penalties against the company for federal Clean Water Act violations have not yet been levied, and an EPA investigation continues. |Sep. 21, 2016, 11:32 AM|Some smoke but no fire likely in Exxon probe, Wells Fargo says

 Saying there may be "some smoke but likely no fire," Wells Fargo analysts rate the likelihood of a negative outcome from a reported SEC investigation into ExxonMobil’s (XOM -0.1%) accounting and climate practices as very slight. XOM has long been conservative on when and how much is capitalized, and its returns on capital employed have consistently outperformed its peers, which is a harder performance to deliver without write-downs, Wells says. But the firm sees the headline risks associated with the SEC probe creating enough investor angst to damage XOM’s reputation and impact its share price performance during the investigation period; while maintaining its Outperform rating, Wells cuts its valuation range on the shares to $93-$103 from $103-$114. |Sep. 21, 2016, 4:25 AM|Announcement expected on 2011 Exxon pipeline spill

Mulacek objected to XOM’s bid when it was announced in July, saying IOC directors should have pressed for a better deal, and says that during the final months of his time as CEO, negotiations were underway with XOM over an offer that was 3x higher than the current deal. Under the July deal, XOM agreed to pay $45-$71.87/share, depending on how much gas in IOC's Elk-Antelope field, which prompted Mulacek to rip into IOC directors as “incompetents” who “ripped off shareholders.”

 Exxon Mobil (XOM -0.8%) is the subject of an SEC investigation over its accounting methods related to asset valuation, and how it calculates the impact of climate change on its business, WSJ reports. The SEC has sought information and documents from XOM as well as auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers, and has been receiving documents that the company submitted as part of the probe into similar issues by New York's attorney general's office, according to the report. The probe may signal the opening of a new front of climate-related regulation and enforcement at the SEC, which would have far-reaching implications for the oil and gas industry. |Sep. 16, 2016, 12:16 PM|Europe's Groningen gas field could face larger production cap

 The Dutch parliament adopted a motion yesterday to review production at the Groningen gas field annually in a bid to determine whether output can be reduced further. In June, the government capped production at 24B cm/year for the coming five years, but the new motion opens the door to further reductions. Output from Europe's largest gas field has been cut in half over the past two years after the country's Safety Board said the government was failing to protect citizens from earthquakes triggered by gas exploitation. The Groningen field is operated by a joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM). |Sep. 16, 2016, 6:14 AM|Exxon's accounting practices are investigated

 Woodside Petroleum (OTCPK:WOPEF, OTCPK:WOPEY) announced yesterday that it would pay as much as $400M for half of BHP Billiton’s (BHP +1.2%) interest in the Scarborough gas field off the Western Australia coast as part of a drive to boost its reserves. The deal will take Woodside’s net share of the Scarborough assets to ~2.6T cf of gas out of a total resource of 8.7T cf. Woodside says it will pay $250M to BHP when the deal is completed, which it expects by year-end, and another $150M if the companies decide to develop the Scarborough field, although Bernstein's Neal Beveridge says the structure of the deal suggests plenty of uncertainty over whether the project will move forward.

 The oil supermajors may struggle to make their dividend payouts as the worst oil downturn in a generation stretches into its third year, Macro Risk Advisors chief energy strategist Chris Kettenmann tells Bloomberg, singling out Exxon Mobil’s (NYSE:XOM) $12B in annual payouts as susceptible. Without a recovery in oil prices from the current sub-$50/bbl level, Kettenmann says major energy explorers will need to increasingly cannibalize drilling budgets to ensure they have enough cash to cover dividend commitments next year.

 Exxon Mobil (XOM -0.3%) is seeking a potential buyer for its 60K bbl/day Billings, Mont., refinery, one of only two XOM refineries in the U.S. that is not integrated with its chemical operations, Reuters reports. Potential buyers including PBF Energy (PBF -0.5%) have visited the plant this summer, according to the report, which says the plant also could attract interest from other independent refiners and Canadian oil producers that seek additional processing capacity. The Billings refinery is considered one of the highest quality plants in the Rocky Mountains, but analysts say plants that do not produce chemicals may have a less predictable profit stream, making them candidates for majors to sell off as refining margins have narrowed. |Aug. 29, 2016, 9:58 AM|Filings show BlackRock withheld support from two key Exxon directors

 BlackRock funds withheld support from two high-profile directors at Exxon Mobil (XOM +0.4%) at the oil company's May 25 shareholder meeting, securities filings show, in a rare dispute apparently driven by a board communications policy. Funds including the $45B BlackRock Global Allocation Fund withheld support from XOM directors Jay Fishman and Kenneth Frazier this year. Reuters reports that BlackRock execs tried to discuss strategy and capital allocation with independent directors of an unnamed "large oil and gas corporation," but were rebuffed because of a policy against such talks, so BlackRock withheld support from the company's lead independent director and the chair of the committee that set the policy; the two were re-elected with 88% and 90% of votes cast, respectively, down from 95% and 98% in 2015.

BP, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) tell state legislators that they will not proceed further with the Alaska LNG project as it is currently structured, saying they support a state takeover of the project.
The companies say the project is still not economical even after cost estimates have been trimmed to the lower range of a previous estimate of $45B-$65B. Energy consultant Wood MacKenzie says the traditional model of a producer owned and financed gasline would be the least competitive of major LNG projects now being planned, although alternatives such as third party investors or full state ownership and tax-exempt status could make the project more competitive. The Department of Energy has issued a license to Alaska LNG to export up to 20M metric tons/year of liquefied natural gas, which would make it one of the world's largest LNG  projects.

Natural gas production from the Marcellus and Utica shales remains surprisingly strong and defying predictions that output would fall, averaging 22.63B cf/day so far in August, up 2% from last month and the most since  February’s all-time high of 22.78B cf/day.
Even though the number of drilling rigs has declined, new production per  rig now averages ~11.4M cf of gas in the Marcellus, up 18% Y/Y, as producers have managed to maintain volumes by tapping inventories of drilled but uncompleted wells and burrowing deeper, longer wells that yield more gas.
Production has been strong despite regional prices at ~$1.2757/MMBtu, less than half the price for benchmark  gas in Louisiana.
Top Marcellus/Utica producers include EQT, RRC, RICE, CVX, CNX, VTG, REXX, XOM, NBL, COG, CHK.

 Some of the world’s largest energy companies are saddled with their highest debt levels ever as they struggle with low crude oil prices, raising worries about their ability to pay dividends and find new barrels, according to a WSJ analysis. Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), BP and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) hold a combined net debt of $184B, more than double their debt levels in 2014, when oil prices began the decline that eventually bottomed out at $27/bbl earlier this year. The rise in net debt has helped push the companies’ gearing, which measures the proportion of a company’s net debt to its equity and influences the ratings given by credit agencies: Shell’s gearing is at 28%, BP’s is more than 25%, CVX’s is 20% and XOM's is ~18%. “Eventually something will give,” says Michael Hulme, manager of the Carmignac Commodities Fund, which holds stakes in Shell and XOM. “These companies won’t be able to maintain the current dividends at $50 to $60 oil.

 Oil Search (OTCPK:OISHF) says development of a second standalone liquefied natural gas export terminal in Papua New Guinea is unlikely, as Exxon Mobil and Total are expected to favor cooperation to expand the existing PNG LNG project.
The company says it is in the midst of a strategy review after losing out in its  battle for InterOil (NYSE:IOC) to be  completed by Q4, which will focus on cooperation between the  PNG LNG and Papua LNG projects to determine what strategies hold the  most value for all stakeholders.
The remarks followed Oil Search's release of H1 results, which included an 89% Y/Y decline in net income to a below consensus $25.6M as a drop in energy prices  offset increased production.
Oil Search owns 29% of the Exxon Mobil-led (NYSE:XOM) PNG LNG project and a 22.8% stake in the Papua LNG development operated by Total and  co-owned by IOC. |Aug. 23, 2016, 10:25 AM|Iraq asks foreign companies to raise oil production and exports

 Iraq's government is asking foreign oil companies to increase oil output and exports, as it joins those spotlighting production potential ahead next month's major meeting of oil producers and consumers. Iraq is OPEC's second largest producer after Saudi Arabia, and an increase in its output - along with Iran - could aggravate the global oil glut and complicate discussions between OPEC and non-OPEC producers on output limits to prop up prices. Iraq has service agreements with companies including BP, CNPC (NYSE:CEO), Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), Eni (NYSE:E), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Lukoil ([[LOUKOY]], OTC:LUKOF), which get paid for the extra barrels produced at fields awarded to them through a bidding process.

 Exxon Mobil (XOM -0.1%) defended its handling of an outage at its Torrance refinery in California following a February 2015 explosion that knocked a gasoline producing unit offline for more than a year, after the Vitol trading company told a state commission that the process had lacked transparency. XOM said it had "operated responsibly and in strict compliance with all laws," after Vitol said a lack of information from XOM made it difficult to time cargo deliveries into the U.S. west coast market. A Vitol trading told a committee of the California Energy Commission earlier in the week that XOM promising that the Torrance refinery would come back online "next month," but that it never seemed to happen.

New York AG Eric Schneiderman said his investigation into Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) has focused on relatively recent statements by the company related to climate change as opposed to the distant past, NYT reports.
In other words, the question for Schneiderman is less about what the company knew, and more what it predicts.
For example, the investigation is scrutinizing a 2014 report by Exxon stating that global efforts to address climate change would not mean that it had to leave enormous amounts of oil reserves in the ground as so-called "stranded assets."

 Exxon Mobil (XOM -0.1%) is urging a quick resolution to a dispute between the Papua New Guinea government and disgruntled landowners, following a protest at its PNG LNG project over royalty disagreements. Protesters reportedly have given the government a seven-day deadline to pay royalties to landowners or they will forcefully shutter the operation. Production at the 6.9M metric tons/year liquefied natural gas project has not been affected, and the protests have been peaceful. |Aug. 5, 2016, 2:31 PM|Reuters: Eni, Exxon finalize deal for Mozambique LNG stake

 Eni (E +0.7%) has wrapped up long-running talks to sell a multi-billion dollar stake in its planned Mozambique liquefied natural gas development to Exxon Mobil (XOM -0.1%), but a deal will not be announced for several months at XOM's request, Reuters reports. Offshore gas reserves already discovered by Eni in Area 4 are large enough to need a large land-based LNG export plant, but talks to bring in a deep-pocketed partner have dragged on due to differences over valuations; last year, Mozambique awarded XOM three offshore exploration license blocks which are just south of Eni's discoveries, giving a new dimension to development prospects. According to the report, Eni and XOM have agreed to terms that could give XOM its desired operating stake in the onshore LNG export plant - perhaps up to 25% - while Eni would retain control over the Area 4 gas fields feeding it.

A pact that 15 U.S. states signed to jointly investigate Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) for allegedly misleading the public about climate change sought to keep prosecutors' deliberations confidential and was broadly written so they could probe other fossil fuel companies.
The agreement, which had not been made public until now, says signatories should keep discussions private and "refuse to disclose any shared information unless required by law."

 "There’s just no place for the supermajors to hide” in the wake of Exxon Mobil's (NYSE:XOM)  lowest quarterly profit since 1999 (I, II) and Chevron’s (NYSE:CVX) third straight loss for its longest slump in 27 years (I, II).
“Oil prices, natural gas, refining, it all looks very bad right now," says Edward Jones analyst Brian Youngberg. The results from both companies came after disappointing results from European peers Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) and BP earlier this week. Q3, which likely will feature the same weak refinery  margins, “could be even worse," says Michael Lynch of Strategic Energy & Economic Research. The pain will extend far longer than just the next quarter, says John LaForge, head of real asset strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, who believes crude oil is in the early stages of a 20-year commodities bear market supercycle - "you might be looking at $30-$60 for the next decade, and it's going to keep bouncing back and forth."

 Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) -2.7% premarket after reporting a substantial Q2 earnings miss for its seventh straight quarter of Y/Y profit declines as well as its eighth straight quarter of falling revenue. XOM says the results reflect sharply lower commodity prices and weaker refining margins; while the company cut its capital budget by 38% during the quarter  to $5.16B, the cuts were not enough to offset depressed oil  prices. Q2 upstream earnings fell 85% Y/Y to $294M from nearly $2B in the year-ago quarter; in the U.S., upstream division losses rose to $514M from $47M a year ago.
Q2 downstream earnings fell 45% Y/Y to $825M from ~$1.5B in the year-ago quarter; before global fuel inventories swelled, the refining unit had helped insulate the company from weak crude prices.
Q2 production was essentially unchanged at 4M boe/day, with liquids up 1.7% and natural gas down 3.6%. |Jul. 29, 2016, 8:01 AM|Exxon Mobil misses by $0.23, misses on revenue

Combined with the ongoing project started last year to add 20K bbl/day of capacity, Beaumont's total refining capacity could reach 400K bbl/day from  the current 345K, making the refinery the  eighth largest in North America.

 Former InterOil (NYSE:IOC) chairman/CEO Phil Mulacek - as well as the company's third-largest investor, with a 5.35% stake - says ExxonMobil’s (NYSE:XOM) takeover offer is “vastly inadequate” and urges XOM to sweeten the offer. Mulacek claims the bonus XOM plans to pay out based on how much gas the Elk-Antelope discovery holds will force IOC shareholders to “forego billions of dollars of value," and believes XOM should modify the way it will calculate the contingent resource payments.
XOM struck a deal last week to pay from $45 to $71.87/share, depending on how rich the  Elk-Antelope field is in gas: XOM’s base price is $45 of its own stock  for each IOC share, and XOM will pay CRPs as high as $26.87/share for every 1T cf of  gas reserves above 6.2T cf that Elk-Antelope holds. |Jul. 25, 2016, 12:20 PM|Saudi's SABIC studying petrochemical JV with Exxon

The project would include a production facility to supply ethylene to other units to produce ethylene  derivatives for shipment to developing countries in Asia and elsewhere, SABIC says. Before making a final decision on the project, XOM and SABIC say they will conduct studies and work with state and local officials to help identify a potential site with adequate infrastructure access; XOM, which has worked with SABIC for more than 30 years on JV projects within Saudi Arabia, also has existing petrochemical complexes in Baytown and Mont Belvieu outside of Houston. |Jul. 22, 2016, 5:57 PM|Exxon deal for InterOil to launch "very active" resource M&A, analyst says

While not the long hoped-for U.S. onshore transaction, the deal "represents a solid example of XOM leveraging its considerable footprint and technical capability into [an] attractively priced long-term resource," the firm says.
The deal size is relatively small for the likes of XOM with limited impact on valuation, but Deutsche Bank believes the asset is a high-quality addition and expects additional similar transactions by XOM.

 Forced to shut its $54B Gorgon liquefied natural gas export plant twice in its first five months, Chevron (CVX +0.1%) now faces calls from union officials for a probe into the site's safety, Reuters reports. The Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union says a failed weld on a valve casing caused the gas leak that forced the plant to close on July 1, and has formally requested access to the site. Two industry sources claim CVX ignored advice from project partners Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) to go slow with the launch of Gorgon, according to the report. The two shutdowns may have cost Gorgon more than $200M in lost output, excluding repairs and other expenditures, and the outages have contributed to a jump in global LNG spot prices, which are up by ~40% since April.
CVX said yesterday that it expected Gorgon production to resume shortly. |Jul. 20, 2016, 11:38 PM|Oil Search concedes to Exxon, pulls out of InterOil bidding

 The way is clear for Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) to buy InterOil (NYSE:IOC) after Oil Search (OTCPK:OISHF) says it is dropping out of the bidding. Oil Search and Total (NYSE:TOT) had jointly offered to buy IOC in May in a deal that valued the company at $2.2B; XOM topped the bid earlier this week with an all-stock offer Oil Search says totaled $2.5B. IOC owns a 36.5% stake in Papua New Guinea's Elk-Antelope natural gas field (TOT is the operator) and had proposed building a second gas project in the country to compete with the existing XOM-led PNG LNG facility. Oil Search and TOT say that allowing XOM to take over IOC could help speed up development of Elk-Antelope and that cooperation between the two projects could save ~$2B. "This scenario would be the lowest cost viable supply in the Pacific Basin," Wood Mackenzie analyst Saul Kavonic tells Reuters. "Those are the negotiations that will have to take place in order for that joint development to occur." |Jul. 20, 2016, 10:27 AM|Total unlikely to fight Exxon over Papua New Guinea gas, analysts say

 Total (TOT -0.7%) says it is analyzing Exxon Mobil's (XOM -0.3%) competing offer for InterOil (IOC -0.4%), its partner in developing natural gas in Papua New Guinea, by Oil Search (OTCPK:OISHF), but analysts say TOT is unlikely to challenge XOM in a bidding war. Analysts say it makes sense for TOT to let XOM have IOC, as using the Elk-Antelope gas field to feed an expansion of XOM's existing PNG LNG plant could generate double the return compared to building TOT's proposed $10B Papua LNG plant. TOT says in its statement that it would remain the largest shareholder of the Elk-Antelope joint venture with 31.1% interest while IOC owns 28.3% and OISHF holds 17.7%. The oil majors are targeting Papua New Guinea for growth as the quality of its gas, low costs and proximity to Asia's big  liquefied natural gas consumers make it one of the world's most attractive places for gas projects.
|Jul. 19, 2016, 12:48 PM|Reuters' Russell: Exxon bid for InterOil a model for buying at the bottom

 Exxon Mobil's (XOM -0.3%) offer to buy InterOil (IOC -0.5%) for at least $2.2B shows “that rare corporate ability of planning a deal at the bottom of the commodity cycle that holds the promise of long-term returns,” Reuters’ Clyde Russell writes. Russell believes that XOM’s best option to expand its 6.9M metric tons/year capacity at its existing Papua New Guinea liquefied natural gas plant is to acquire sufficient reserves to justify building another liquefaction train in the country; IOC's Elk-Antelope gas field holds at least 6.2T cf of natural gas, and further drilling should expand this reserve. Russell says this means that XOM's bid, if successful, could underwrite the expansion of its PNG LNG project on a time scale that may see it deliver its first cargoes just as the surplus of LNG is expected to disappear in the mid-2020s. The big question, according to Russell is the next move from Total (TOT -1%) - operator and 40.1% owner of Elk-Antelope with IOC the next biggest holder at 36.5% - which has outlined plans to build its own LNG project in Papua New Guinea. |Jul. 18, 2016, 2:23 AM|ExxonMobil launches bidding war for InterOil

 Exxon Mobil's (XOM -0.1%) Nigerian subsidiary says it has declared force majeure on exports of Qua Iboe crude oil, the country's largest export stream. XOM says only that a "system anomaly" was observed during a routine check of its loading facility on July 14, but traders say it will take least 2-4 weeks to repair. XOM has struggled to bring Qua Iboe production back to normal after a May accident on a drilling rig that damaged a pipeline, after which the company also declared force majeure. 
Earlier this week, XOM refuted claims from the Niger Delta Avengers to have blown up the Qua Iboe 48" crude oil export pipeline operated by the company.

 Lower costs and improved productivity have enabled U.S. shale oil drillers to made major strides in adapting to lower crude prices, energy consultant Wood Mackenzie says. Shale drillers have cut the costs of producing new supplies of oil by as much as 40% in the past two years by pushing for lower rates from the companies that provide rigs, pipes and other services. Wood Mackenzie estimates that oil companies could make money in west Texas' Bone Spring and Wolfcamp tight oil  plays with $37/bbl oil, the Eagle Ford Shale  in south Texas could turn a profit at $48/bbl, the average  breakeven price in North Dakota’s Bakken Shale is $58/bbl, while breakeven at Oklahoma’s SCOOP region is $35/bbl.

 A group of 19 Democrats took the senate floor yesterday to call for an end to the fossil fuel industry’s “web of denial” on climate change, particularly singling out Exxon Mobil (XOM +0.2%) for criticism. A resolution introduced by Sen.

XOM says, “To suggest that we had reached definitive  conclusions, decades before the world’s experts and while climate  science was in an early stage of development, is not credible.”

 Chevron (CVX -0.6%) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) are the top picks among supermajor oil companies, while BP (BP -0.3%), Total (TOT -3.2%) and Exxon Mobil (XOM -1%) are less desirable, according to a new report from Tudor Pickering Holt. Tudor likes CVX for its high-margin growth, free cash flow turnaround from its Australian liquefied natural gas projects and its top quality Permian position, and appreciates Shell for its "safe dividend" and achievable asset sale program, which will help it reduce debt and ultimately re-initiate a stock buyback. The firm is only lukewarm on BP because of its stretched balance sheet, is concerned about TOT's project execution risk and lack of longer-term projects, and says XOM  remains challenged in terms of future growth which should weigh on its premium valuation. |Jul. 5, 2016, 11:47 AM|Exxon may be InterOil's mystery suitor, reports say

 Chevron (NYSE:CVX) said this week in a presentation that the decision on expanding its Tengiz development in Kazakhstan will be made in mid-2016, which would essentially confirm a prediction made in May by the Kazakh energy minister. The project, which was put on hold last year after cost estimates ballooned amid plunging oil prices, may cost as much as $40B and add crude supply equivalent to that of the country of Libya. "This is very big and very important for Chevron and for Kazakhstan, [and] shows that the situation is now turning in the oil market that people are putting down this kind of money," says an analyst at the IHS consulting firm. Tengiz produced ~595K bbl/day last year, and the expansion will involve pumping sulfur-laden gas back into the rocks to force out an additional 250K-300K bbl/day. CVX has a 50% interest in the field that already accounts for nearly 20% of the company's total worldwide production; minority partners are Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Kazmunaigaz and Lukoil (OTCPK:LUKOY, OTC:LUKOF).

 Exxon Mobil (XOM -0.5%) and BP (BP +1.2%) are at odds over a giant oil production deal with Azerbaijan, blocking renewal of what was once called "the contract of the century," Reuters reports, citing three high-level industry sources. BP, which operates the Azeri-Chigar-Guneshli fields in the Caspian Sea and relies on them for 10% of its global output, is said to have tentatively agreed to terms with the Azeri government on extending the 30-year contract, but XOM, which also has a stake in the ACG consortium, is holding out for a better deal. The result is a deadlock in talks over a project that could produce another $100B worth of oil at current prices and has exacerbated old tensions between XOM CEO Rex Tillerson and BP's Bob Dudley, according to the report. BP holds a 35.8% interest stake in the project, and XOM owns only 8%; other members include Azeri state oil firm Socar and Chevron (CVX -0.7%) each with more than 11%, Japan's Inpex with 11%, and Norway's Statoil (STO +0.4%) with 8.6%. |Jul. 1, 2016, 8:15 AM|Chevron suspends Gorgon LNG production after leak

 Chevron (NYSE:CVX) says it has suspended production at the Gorgon liquefied natural gas export facility in Australia after a leak but remains on track to make a second shipment in coming days. Traders cite news of the leak as a reason for a boost in Asian LNG prices to the highest level since February. The $54B project faced delays, cost overruns and labor unrest during construction, and in April temporarily halted production just two weeks after making its first shipment, citing a  malfunction with the propane refrigerant circuit, used to cool gas  supplied to the plant. Gorgon is a joint venture including operator CVX with a 47.3% stake, and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) with 25% each. |Jun. 30, 2016, 6:58 PM|WSJ: Exxon more aggressively pushing for carbon tax

 Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is ramping up its lobbying of other energy companies to support a carbon tax, marking a shift in its approach to climate change, WSJ reports. Top XOM officials have been more vocal about their support for a carbon tax and have met with D.C. officials and trade associations about related legislation, according to the report, citing the company’s recent lobby disclosure forms. "Exxon’s positioning on a carbon tax had been passive - ‘Hey, we’re not loving it, but we’re not going to get in the way of it,’” says Michael McKenna, president of energy lobbying firm MWR Strategies. “In just the last six months, there’s been an uptick in how they are asserting themselves in meetings about how to address this issue.” In actively pushing for a carbon tax behind the scenes, XOM would be the first major U.S. energy company to move closer to the positions of European energy firms such as BP and Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) which have publicly advocated for a price on carbon.

 Exxon Mobil (XOM +1.2%) and Hess (HES +3.5%) confirm a “world-class discovery” off the coast of Guyana that probably will yield 800M-1.4B boe of crude. The news confirms earlier comments by Guyana's natural resources minister, and the upper end of the new estimate is 2x larger than an earlier estimate that the field could contain 700M barrels of oil. The discovery is considered particularly significant for Hess; at the high end of the estimate, Hess' stake equates to 420M barrels, a 39% addition to its proved reserves; the company says more exploratory drilling is planned for the Stabroek block that hosts the Liza field. The companies could break even on developing the field at less than $40/bbl, Wells Fargo analysts estimate. XOM is operator of the Liza discovery and owns a 45% interest, while Hess holds a 30% stake and China's Cnooc (CEO +0.8%) owns the remaining 25%. |Jun. 30, 2016, 2:48 PM|U.S. Virgin Islands withdraws subpoena of Exxon in climate probe

 Exxon Mobil (XOM +1.2%) scores a small victory against its detractors as the U.S. Virgin Islands' attorney general agrees to withdraw his subpoena against the company that was part of a push by a group of state prosecutors to investigate whether XOM misled the public about climate change risks. The subpoena from the U.S. Virgin Islands was noticeable because it tried to invoke the territory's anti-racketeering laws, which are similar to  U.S. RICO laws.
The Virgin Islands AG was one of at least four who had issued subpoenas.

 Canadian oil and gas companies say they are not worried about the new North America-wide energy and climate change strategy announced yesterday by Canadian PM Trudeau, U.S. Pres. Obama and Mexican Pres. Nieto, which includes reducing methane gas emissions from the oil and gas industry by 40%-45%. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers says “having our competitors held to a similar standard is going to be good for all of us," since Canadian producers already are under pressure to cut methane emissions and pay carbon levies. TransCanada (NYSE:TRP) says it welcomed the agreement and cited its growing natural gas pipeline business in Mexico and its acquisition of Columbia Pipelines in the U.S. as evidence of the need for an interconnected energy system.
The pact would force the three countries to add renewables, nuclear projects or carbon capture and storage projects on coal-fired  power plants that would raise the total to 50% from the current 37%.

 Exxon Mobil (XOM +0.8%), Chevron (CVX +1.2%) and Tesoro (TSO -0.5%) are among refiners being investigated by California's attorney general over allegations they withheld supply in an attempt to artificially raise  gasoline prices in the state, WSJ reports. The subpoenas were sent in late May and seek information about trading, maintenance and repair activities at the companies since 2014, according to the report. Other companies receiving subpoenas reportedly also included Phillips 66 (PSX -0.9%), Valero (VLO -2.1%) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B). "Many factors that determine the price of gasoline," a TSO spokesperson says, including "the cost of crude oil, distribution and marketing costs, refining costs and federal and state taxes. Market conditions, such as supply and demand, determine the price that consumers pay at the pump.” |Jun. 29, 2016, 11:57 AM|Bloomberg: Exxon weighs stakes in Eni and Anadarko blocks off Mozambique

 Exxon Mobil (XOM +1.5%) is considering buying stakes in natural gas discoveries off Mozambique made by Anadarko Petroleum and Eni, Bloomberg reports. Acquiring a share of APC’s Area 1 in the Rovuma Basin off Mozambique’s north coast could generate ~$1.3B in capital gains tax for the government, which would help ease the country's credit crunch, according to the report. XOM also is said to be interested in Eni’s Area 4; three years ago, China National Petroleum purchased 20% of Area 4 for $4.2B. XOM last October won three exploration licenses for offshore blocks to the south of the APC and Eni Mozambique discoveries, and has a working interest in Statoil’s Block 2 in Tanzania, north of the Rovuma Basin. |Jun. 28, 2016, 2:29 PM|Union warns Statoil not to scale back agreements in strike threat

 Statoil (STO +3.3%) must not attempt to scale back existing labor agreements if it wants to prevent a strike by Norwegian oil and gas workers beginning July 2, says the Industri Energi union, which represents two-thirds of the workers that would strike. Three unions said yesterday that 755 Norwegian workers on seven oil and gas fields operated by STO, Exxon Mobil (XOM +1.2%) and Engie (OTCPK:ENGIY) will strike unless a deal on wages and other working conditions is agreed; Reuters says the fields account for ~18% of Norway's combined output of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. XOM and Engie have said a conflict would cut output at the fields they operate, while STO has declined to comment on all aspects of the negotiations. 
Crude oil prices today are ~3% higher, bouncing off their Brexit-fueled selloff, and the threat of the Norway strike is said to be one of the causes. ETFs: USO, OIL, UWTI, UCO, DWTI, SCO, BNO, DBO, DTO, USL, DNO, OLO, SZO, OLEM

 A Canadian government study yields a surprising result about what happens to oil sands crude in a freshwater spill: it floats, at least for a while, sinking more slowly than conventional oil, unless exposed to high temperatures and weathering. The results may help dispel some concern that a spill of diluted bitumen would be more difficult to clean up, and help companies make the case for pipeline projects such as Kinder Morgan’s (KMI +0.9%) Trans Mountain expansion and Enbridge’s (ENB -0.1%) Northern Gateway pipeline.

 The Dutch government said on Friday it would lower the cap on production at the Groningen gas field to 24B cm/year for the next five years, following a recommendation by the Dutch National Mines Inspectorate. The Dutch economic affairs minister says the state expects to lose €345M/year ($380M) in revenues because of the new cap, but analysts say the reduction from 27B cm/year is close to what was expected and "may even provide some relief to markets that may have anticipated a prolonged decline to 2020." The Inspectorate says earthquakes have been decreasing in frequency and intensity in Groningen since the government began reducing production from 42.5B cm in the peak production year of 2014; the field is operated by NAM, a joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM).
|Jun. 25, 2016, 8:25 AM|Oil companies cranking up 500K bbl/day in new Gulf of Mexico production

 The U.S. currently pumps ~8.7M bbl/day of crude oil, 480K less than at the end of 2015, but more than 500K bbl/day of new crude from the Gulf of Mexico is set to come online this year and next, WSJ reports, threatening to prolong the oil glut and hold down prices. One reason is a handful of massive oil fields sanctioned for development years ago by companies such as BP and Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) that will start pumping later this year, but another is that companies have found that smaller satellite fields can be tapped inexpensively by tieback wells linked to existing offshore oil platforms via underwater pipelines. Exxon (NYSE:XOM) this year began pumping from the tieback Julia offshore well, with production piped back to a Chevron (NYSE:CVX) platform; CVX also recently executed a tieback that will produce 50% more oil and gas than it originally expected. Noble Energy (NYSE:NBL) nearly doubled its Gulf output in Q1 and has another well starting to pump later this summer; Anadarko (NYSE:APC) has more than 30 tieback well prospects in satellite fields, and will drill up to seven this year. Companies also are getting better at accessing deepwater finds; Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) saved $1B drilling its Stones project, which will start up later this year, by using a slim-well design offshore engineers borrowed from onshore shale operations.

 PBF Energy (PBF -1.7%) once expected to take control of the Torrance, Calif., refinery from Exxon Mobil (XOM -0.2%) by around May 1, but the handoff has been plagued with problems, and PBF now expects to take over the refinery on July 1, Bloomberg reports. A crane that fell over this week is the latest incident to highlight the challenges in finalizing the $537M sale, after damage from a February 2015 explosion forced the closure of a catalytic cracker, which finally was restarted just a month ago. The delays are keeping PBF from fully benefiting from typically higher margins seen during peak driving season, but PBF is not likely to walk away from the deal, as it still wants control of the Torrance plant to gain exposure to the West Coast gasoline market. |Jun. 22, 2016, 11:43 AM|Southern California refiners grow concerned over blackout risk

 Southern California refiners are bracing for potential disruptions ahead of possible  blackouts this summer as state regulators to warn of power and gas shortages. On top of a heat wave that has swept the region, testing power grids that rely heavily on natural gas for fuel, power generators face strained gas supplies as SoCalGas' Aliso Canyon facility remains out of commission following last year's huge gas leak. Any stoppages at the refineries likely would cause gasoline prices to rise in California, already the largest and most expensive gasoline market in the continental U.S. Tesoro (TSO +0.1%), which operates two refineries in the region, says the Watson cogeneration facility at its Los Angeles refinery utilizes natural gas to produce steam to operate the refinery.

Crude oil prices push more than 2% higher, with Brent at $50.68/bbl and WTI at $49.75, thanks to a falling dollar, continued attacks on oil infrastructure in Nigeria, and reports of a pipeline failure and spill at Exxon Mobil's (XOM +1.2%) Torrance refinery near Los Angeles. However, XOM has since told CNBC that the refinery had experienced a refining byproduct leak in an internal pipe that was contained in the Torrance property, and there is no impact to operations. An incident at Torrance normally would not cause a significant jump in oil prices, but analysts say the current market is sensitive to any perception of a supply disruption.

 ConocoPhillips (COP +0.3%) is BofA Merrill Lynch analyst Doug Leggate's "top free cash yield idea" in the oil and gas E&P group, despite COP's reduced dividend yield after the dividend cut earlier this year, as he shifts focus from top dividend payers such as Exxon Mobil (XOM -1.5%) - which the analyst downgraded to Neutral from Buy - to yield plays. Leggate says COP is well positioned to deliver outsize returns to shareholders via buybacks, while “potentially supporting competitive ‘growth per share’ that bridges the gap between the majors and the E&Ps.” Because of under-investment in both short and long cycle oil and gas projects, the analyst believes "the commodity discussion is poised for a shift towards one of undersupply and increased risk that oil prices overshoot to the upside. In that scenario, Big Oil would likely lag more levered peers, further positioning COP as our preferred major oil name.” BofA maintains a Buy rating for COP with a $71 price target.

 A Who's Who of Big Oil - including Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), BP, Total (NYSE:TOT), Statoil (NYSE:STO), Repsol (OTCQX:REPYF, OTCQX:REPYY) and Mexico's Pemex are among the major players now registered to take part in Mexico’s deepwater oil auction to be held in December. The Mexican government hopes to see ~$7B in investment come in from the auction phase for what is reputed to be the most lucrative blocks in the Gulf of Mexico. “Exploration in deep water can take as long as eight years and production can be up to 10 years, so the current low prices don’t really have a big effect on these projects," says the president of Mexico’s National Hydrocarbons Commission. |May 31, 2016, 6:38 PM|Exxon's lack of output growth outweighed by other factors, Wells Fargo says

 Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) seems unlikely to deliver much production growth but it likely will deliver industry leading returns, dividend growth - as it has for 34 consecutive years - and solid shareholder returns, Wells Fargo analysts say as they reiterate an Outperform rating on the shares.

 The amount of pollution created by vapor from Canada’s oil sands ranks on par with most major cities in North America, according to a new study by the country’s environmental regulator. While the connection between the oil sands’ carbon emissions and climate change is well documented, the study is the first to track the vapor produced in the process and the extent of the resulting pollution. Vapor from the bitumen of the oil sands is released into the air when it is dug up in open pit mines and later as the oil is separated out, and once in the atmosphere and exposed to sunlight, the vapors mix with other chemicals to become particles known as secondary organic aerosols; according to the study, the oil sands were rivaled by only the largest metro areas such as Los Angeles in creating the particles; vehicle exhaust and electrical generation are the main sources of the particles in cities.

 Exxon Mobil (XOM +0.6%) shareholders defeat resolutions backed by environmentalists that would have pushed the company to take a stronger stand on actions to limit climate change. Investors at XOM's annual meeting rejected 10 climate-related proposals, but did vote to ask directors to adopt a proxy-access rule, which would make it easier for shareholders to propose board candidates and remove incumbent directors; the rule potentially could allow a climate activist eventually to become a director. More than 60% of XOM shareholders backed proxy access, which was narrowly defeated last year; XOM's board had opposed the proposal, saying it risked increasing the influence of "special interest groups."

 Global oil firms have warned Iraq that projects to increase crude oil output will be delayed if the government insists on drastic spending cuts this year, Reuters reports. Oil companies helping Iraq develop its oil fields must clear spending with the government each year, and they are then repaid with crude oil produced from existing fields; since crude prices have weakened, the government has been struggling to find enough oil to repay the companies for their investment and is spending heavily to fight Islamic State in its northern and western provinces. The Iraqi government request was contained in Oil Ministry letters to BP, Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), Exxon (NYSE:XOM), Eni (NYSE:E), Lukoil (OTCPK:LUKOY, OTC:LUKOF) and Petronas, some of whom say that the proposed budgets may prevent them from continuing operations in the country. |May 13, 2016, 4:05 PM|Blast hits another Chevron oil facility in Nigeria's Delta

 Analysts say the recent spate of investments in renewable energy by the likes of Exxon Mobil (XOM -0.9%) and Total (TOT +0.5%) shows the supermajors recognize the potential for growth in low-carbon sources of energy, but it is too early to know if the moves represent a broader push by oil companies at large to diversify their clean energy holdings. XOM last week unveiled a partnership with FuelCell Energy (FCEL -0.9%) to cut the cost of cutting emissions from new  and existing fossil fuel plants, Enbridge (ENB -0.5%) yesterday said it would pay $218M for stakes in offshore wind farms, while Total announced a $1.1B deal on Monday to buy battery maker Saft Groupe, complementing its 2011 purchase of a majority stake in solar-panel maker SunPower Corp. Oil companies are not the only traditional energy players pushing into clean power: France's Engie (OTCPK:ENGIY) said this week it was buying an 80% stake in California storage company Green Charge Networks. Still, the investments are tiny by petroleum industry standards: TOT’s $1.1B deal to buy Saft represents a tiny fraction of its $120B  market value, and ENB’s $218M deal equals less than 1% of its 2015 revenue. |May 11, 2016, 10:58 AM|Academics back climate disclosure votes at Exxon, Chevron

As part of its start-up procedure, XOM plans to turn off the  refinery's pollution control system for six hours, a step approved by  the South Coast Air Quality Management District.
The refinery has been operating at only ~20% of its normal production since a February 2015 explosion destroyed the plant's pollution control system; without the full operation of the plant, which usually generates 20% of southern California's refined gasoline capacity, gas prices in the Los Angeles region rose as much  as $1.50 above the national average last year.
After Torrance is fully operational, XOM plans to sell the plant  to PBF Energy (NYSE:PBF) in a deal expected to close by  midyear.

 Alberta's raging wildfire has caused Canadian crude oil output to drop by at least 475K bbl/day, or nearly 20% of Canada's 2.5M barrels in total oil sands production - much of it typically sent to U.S. refineries. While no oil operations have sustained damage from the fires, many operators have cut output amid evacuations of non-essential staff, pipeline outages and the risk from encroaching fire. The amount of daily oil production threatened by the Canadian fires would be enough to nearly wipe out the world's oversupply, says Tim Pickering of Auspice Capital Advisors, calling the blaze "the most important issue in oil today." The Bank of Nova Scotia says the destruction of property and loss of production could mean "very little" GDP growth during Q2 for the overall Canadian economy and that the damage to infrastructure will slow the recovery in the country's oil patch. In the latest of a series of plant closures, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) today shut down its Surmont oil sands site that produces 50K bbl/day and evacuated all staff, and Suncor (NYSE:SU) cut output at its 350K bbl/day Syncrude mining operation and its 203K bbl/day Firebag well site without specifying how much.

 FuelCell Energy (NASDAQ:FCEL) +22.7% premarket after announcing a partnership with Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) to pursue potentially revolutionary technology for capturing carbon dioxide emissions through a new application of carbonate fuel cells. The companies say they will focus initially on how to further increase efficiency in separating and concentrating carbon dioxide from the exhaust of natural gas-fueled power turbines; a second phase would more  comprehensively test the technology in a small-scale pilot project prior to integration at a larger-scale pilot  facility.
Carbon capture technology has been plagued by setbacks and delays, but the new FCEL-XOM method uses fuel cells; the exhaust from a power plant and  natural gas are fed into a fuel cell, and the reactions generate power  and create a concentrated stream of carbon dioxide that can be more easily  captured.

 The huge wildfire (I, II) that already has forced more than 80K people to flee their homes in and around Fort McMurray and disrupted oil sands operations in Alberta reportedly is set to expand. Wildfire officials say the blaze probably will grow to 100 sq. km (40 sq. miles) from ~80 now, and that although lower temperatures may aid firefighters tomorrow, the fire is expected to last at least until the weekend.
WTI crude oil prices have jumped past $45/bbl overnight as the fire disrupts oil sands production. Alberta oil sands producers are not yet in the fire's path but have cut or halted operations because of evacuations: Royal Dutch Shell’s (RDS.A, RDS.B) Canadian unit shut its Albian Sands mining operations which produce ~255K bbl/day, Suncor (NYSE:SU) cut production at all of its oil sands sites, Inter Pipeline (OTCPK:IPPLF) partially closed its 540K bbl/day Polaris pipeline system and its 346K bbl/day Corridor system, Husky Energy (OTCPK:HUSKF) cut output at its Sunrise oil sands plant by two-thirds to 10K bbl/day, Exxon’s (NYSE:XOM) Imperial Oil (NYSEMKT:IMO) Canadian unit says production has not yet been affected, and operations by Enbridge (NYSE:ENB), Pembina Pipeline (NYSE:PBA) and Canadian Natural Resources (NYSE:CNQ) apparently have not been affected.

Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU) said late last night that it was “reducing production” at all of its oil sands operations in the region; the company, which produces 453K bbl/day from its oil sands sites in northern Alberta, did not quantify the volume or timeline for the reduced output.

 A new study finds that fracking of U.S. shale fields is causing a global surge in ethane emissions. Ethane is known to contribute to global warming and dangerous air pollution. Global ethane levels had been falling since the 1980s, but in 2010 a sensor in Europe picked up a surprise increase. U.S. shale fracking was thought to be the culprit. More recently, a single field in the North Dakota and Montana Bakken Formation has been found to be emitting 2% of the worldwide total. "Two percent might not sound like a lot, but the emissions we observed in this single region are 10 to 100 times larger than reported in inventories. They directly impact air quality across North America. And they're sufficient to explain much of the global shift in ethane concentrations," said Eric Kort, the first author of the new study published in Geophysical Research Letters. Ethane emissions from other U.S. fields, especially the Texas Eagle Ford, likely contributed as well, the research team says. The findings illustrate the key role of shale oil and gas production in rising ethane levels. Baaken stocks include: CLR, ERF, EOG, HK, HES, MRO, OAS, QEP, SM, STO, TPLM, WLL

While the four oil majors reporting this week - Exxon (XOM +0.4%), BP, Total, and Chevron - were bailed out by their downstream businesses (only Chevron missed estimates), they're still borrowing heavily to fund capex and the dividends upon which they've staked their reputations, writes Liam Denning.
Combined free cash flow for the trailing four quarters stands at negative $39B.
While Exxon isn't the worst of the bunch, S&P did take away its AAA rating earlier this week. In true Exxon fashion, the company responded with a dividend hike, this morning's earnings release made no mention of the rating change, and the earnings call had plenty of reminders of the company's long history of dealing with good and bad times.
But CEO Rex Tillerson is set to retire within a year, and it looks like he'll turn over a weaker company than the one he inherited from Lee Raymond. Along with the rating cut, the company didn't replace reserves last year for the first time in more than 20 years, paid $35B for XTO Energy at the peak in natural gas prices, inked an ill-timed partnership with Rosneft, and hasn't really grown oil and gas production.
As part of its ratings cut, S&P cited worry about Exxon's ability to replace reserves as debt climbs. Without production growth, notes Denning, how do you square rising leverage with a commitment to raising dividends, not to mention restarting buybacks (barring, of course, a big rebound in oil prices)?

 The long-coveted AAA credit rating doesn't seem to mean as much as it used to for Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and its investors, as the company raised its quarterly dividend one day after Standard & Poor's downgraded XOM, citing generous payouts to shareholders. With interest rates so low, many companies would rather borrow more to fund items such as shareholder returns than maintain a top rating, and XOM has hiked its dividend for 34 consecutive years. However, the dividend increase was just 2.7%, the smallest raise since at least Q1 2006, when the dividend rose 10%. At a combined $325B in dividends and repurchases, XOM's spending on shareholders in the last 11 years has exceeded by nearly 20% its outlays of $271.7B for new property, plant and equipment over the same period, according to Reuters.

 Goldman Sachs global head of commodities research Jeff Currie says oil prices  may stay low enough for long enough to force Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and its big oil peers to cut their dividends. Goldman sees oil prices ending the year at $45/bbl, and "if we stay in a $50-$60-type price environment most of  these companies have embedded in their outlooks, it's going to be very  difficult to actually make those types of dividend payments" that were  structured when oil prices were much higher. Other analysts believe the majors have brought down costs enough to fund dividends; Cowen says "operational efficiencies, cost reduction, and asset sales should allow [integrated oil companies] to sustain dividends and bridge the funding gap through 2017." ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) cut its dividend by two-thirds earlier this year, while Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and XOM have maintained their respective 4.2% and 3.3% payouts but have suspended stock buybacks. 
BP, which reported better than expected Q1 earnings today, maintained its dividend but RBC Capital warns that tighter margins in BP's downstream refining business combined with  weakness in its upstream gas exploration segment could make its  dividend unsustainable.

 Exxon Mobil (XOM +0.2%) loses the AAA credit rating from Standard & Poor's it held since the 1930s, as the ratings agency downgrades XOM to AA+ and says the company’s greatest business challenge is replacing its ongoing production.
"We believe Exxon Mobil's credit measures will be weak for our  expectations for a 'AAA' rating due, in part, to low commodity prices,  high reinvestment requirements, and large dividend payments," S&P  says. S&P maintains a stable outlook on XOM but says the company's debt level had more than doubled in recent years, reflecting high capital spending and dividends as well as share repurchases that substantially exceeded internal cash flow.

Australia's competition regulator says it wants to break up a marketing joint  venture between  Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and BHP Billiton (NYSE:BHP)  to help  boost  competition in the eastern Australian gas market.
Suppliers have "taken advantage" of potentially  lower gas supply by raising prices  and placing onerous  conditions on buyers, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission concludes following a year-long probe.
The commission says one possible step to help deal with the problem for  end users would be to  consider ordering XOM and BHP to sell  gas separately; XOM says such a move would increase costs, and BHP notes that the joint venture has been producing for  more than 45 years and has served the market well.

 Alberta's provincial government releases technical formulas for its new oil and gas royalty framework, a move welcomed by the energy industry as providing clarity to potential investors and enabling producers to move forward with drilling and investment plans. Analysts say the technical formulas  are a net positive for producers by basing well cost allowances on the 2012-15 period when costs were higher, but oil prices - and whether they recover or continue to languish near $40/bbl - would have a much greater impact on investment decisions in Alberta than the royalty structure. Alberta's new NDP government unveiled its new royalty framework in January which left rates largely unchanged on oil sands projects and existing wells.

Bloomberg's Liam Denning makes the case for Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) as the real winner in the failure to reach a production freeze at Doha, as the company is well equipped to weather what is likely to be a volatile few quarters in the oil market.
For starters, Denning says the highly levered sectors of the oil industry no longer will be lifted by freeze hopes and instead must sink or swim based on market fundamentals, an environment that should help XOM.
XOM now can hope that weaker petro-states will be forced to soften the resource  nationalism that has kept western oil majors away from reserves on  economic terms for much of the past decade or so, Denning writes.
More tangibly, XOM has said it is looking at possible acquisitions but that potential targets have unrealistic expectations on price, which likely will soften now, according to Denning, adding that when XOM finally makes its move, it will be "a reasonably good sign that a sustainable rally, not one based on ministerial mutterings, is underway."

 Spending in Canada’s oil and natural gas sector has fallen by a record C$50B (US$38B) over the past two years, a 62% drop that marks the biggest two-year decline since 1947 when data  was first collected, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.
The  group predicts total capital investment in the oil and natural gas  sector will fall to C$31B in 2016, down from C$48B in 2015  and a record C$81B in 2014.
CAPP  also forecasts that the total number of wells drilled in Canada’s western  provinces, home to the world's third largest oil reserves, will  fall to 3,500 in 2016 from 10,400 drilled in 2014 and that capital spending there will drop to $17B this year, about half of 2014 levels.

 Chevron (NYSE:CVX) says it expects to resume production within 30-60 days at Australia's Gorgon liquefied natural gas export terminal, which was halted after only one export shipment due to mechanical problems. CVX says that based on initial findings from a team assessing the problem, the repair work is "of a routine nature" and all required equipment and material are available on site. CVX says it still expects Train 1 to ramp up to full capacity over  6-8 months, and construction work on Trains 2 and 3 are not affected by the production halt; the three production lines will produce 15.6M metric  tons/year of LNG at full capacity, plus enough natural gas to generate  electricity for 2.5M Australian homes. Gorgon's first cargo, which was shipped in March, arrived today at  its destination with Japanese utility Chubu Electric. CVX is Gorgon's operator and majority owner, with stakes of 25% each by Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B).

 Chevron (CVX -0.4%) says it has temporarily shut down its massive Gorgon  liquefied natural gas facility in Australia, less than a month after it started first production, after encountering mechanical  problems at a cooling unit that prevents the plant from chilling natural gas for exporting on tankers. The production halt is a blow to CVX, which operates Gorgon and owns 47% of the project; Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) and Exxon Mobil (XOM +0.7%) each own 25%, with the balance held by a trio of Japanese utilities. Traders say the outage of the huge facility could support Asian LNG prices, which have slumped by nearly 80% from their peak in 2014 to $4.30/MMBtu. An LNG business development manager for Asia Pacific at Platts says teething problems are not unusual in projects of Gorgon's scale, and rigorous testing  likely will continue for at least three months; CVX says it is not yet able to provide details and that "a site team is currently assessing the situation and we should know more shortly."

 Regulators have agreed to let Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) resume operations at its Torrance, Calif., oil refinery more than a year after an explosion crippled  the plant.The South Coast Air Quality Management District board voted 3-2 to allow the restart following a boisterous daylong public hearing on Saturday, but passage was expected. During the restart, the refinery is expected to pump emissions into the air for about six hours longer than allowed by the South Coast Air Quality Management District, so the regulator told XOM not to restart during school and business hours, when people could be exposed to excess pollution, and pay $5M in penalties for air pollution violations after the explosion.XOM is selling the refinery to PBF Energy (NYSE:PBF) for $537M, though the plant must be operational before the sale is  completed; some opponents of the plant criticized XOM at the hearing for getting the plant up and running just so it can complete the sale.Now read Exxon Mobil: More reasons why you should be buying |Apr. 4, 2016, 7:23 AM|WisdomTree LargeCap Dividend ETF (DLN) March Summary

The anticipated return to service of Exxon Mobil's (NYSE:XOM) Torrance refinery, which has operated at less than 20% of capacity since a February 2015 explosion, could help narrow the ongoing gap between fuel prices for motorists in southern California and other parts of the U.S. Today, the South Coast Air Quality Management District will hold a hearing in Torrance to review XOM's request to fully restore the refinery, which usually provides 20% of the refined gasoline capacity in southern California and 10% of statewide capacity.
Returning the refinery to full service will set the stage for the sale of  the plant to PBF Energy (NYSE:PBF), which announced last fall that it was  acquiring the facility once it is fully operational; the acquisition  also could help lower California pump prices, depending on how  aggressively PBF decides to operate.
Some residents are alarmed by the planned restart, saying it is not known how much emissions limits will be exceeded and that residents are forced to rely on XOM rather than independent evaluations to provide data. In other Exxon news, the last group of union workers at its Baytown, Tex., refining and petrochemical complex have voted to accept a four-year contract extension, joining workers who had passed the extension in voting last week. |Apr. 1, 2016, 3:47 PM|InterOil confirms requisition by Mulacek-led investor group

 The world’s biggest oil companies are draining their petroleum reserves faster than they are replacing them, a symptom of how the oil price decline is reshaping the energy industry’s priorities, WSJ reports. The seven biggest publicly traded Western energy companies - including Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), BP and Statoil (NYSE:STO) - last year replaced only 75% of the oil and natural gas they pumped; among the group, only Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Total (NYSE:TOT) and Eni (NYSE:E) added more new barrels than they pumped. For XOM, 2015 marked the first time in more than two decades it did not fully replace production with new reserves, replacing 67% of its 2015 output, but it certainly is not about to run out of crude, retaining enough reserves to last 16 years at the current rate of production. Low oil prices mean “it becomes less important” to replenish stockpiles, says Eni's chief exploration officer, one of several oil producers that have shifted spending in favor of squeezing more out of fields that are already producing.

If approved, the proposal would force XOM to outline specific risks that climate change or legislation designed to curb it could pose to its ability to operate profitably. XOM had argued the proposal was vague and that it already publishes carbon-related information for shareholders, but the SEC determined XOM's efforts do not go far enough.

Credit Suisse says CVX is reaching a "sweet spot" and in an ideal position for better capital efficiency moving forward; the firm thinks CVX has reached the crossover point where long-lived  mega-projects are completed, cash flow is set to rise, and management could steer the capex wheel towards shorter cycle and lower capital intensive activity.

XOM has the financial flexibility to increase spending if the right opportunities arise, but the CEO said the company is more likely to purchase stand-alone assets than whole companies, and he believed many companies have damaged their value by raising debt or issuing equity to deal with low oil prices.
Meanwhile, Evercore ISI analyst Doug Terreson told CNBC he is confident that XOM will be able to weather the low-priced oil  storm, and the company is in a "superior position" vs. competitors because it has done a better job of managing its capital, "and  they're in a really strong position from a financial perspective."
Terreson thinks dividends from XOM, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and BP  are safe, and that it would "take a lot" for the companies to cut: "If we have $15-$20 oil for a period of time" it  might happen, although in that scenario there would  ultimately be "bigger problems."

Exxon Mobil's (NYSE:XOM) sale today of $12B of new bonds pushed the investment grade  corporate bond market to the second busiest February on record, totaling $104.3B, Reuters reports.
The strong result is all the more impressive considering the market volatility that had frozen credit  market for the first  half of the month; when the market calmed down, the stability allowed a string  of big name issuers to come to market, starting with Apple's $12B offering on Feb. 15.
XOM's $12B, eight-part deal today shows the bond boom is not over,  and that debt markets are still available for highly rated companies  that need to sell bonds to pay for debt refinancing, capital spending  or share buybacks; five other firms also sold bonds today,  including Hyatt Hotels (NYSE:H) and SunTrust Banks (NYSE:STI).
Still, XOM has not emerged unscathed from the oil downturn; for example, a 10-year bond offered today is expected to yield 1.3 percentage points more than Treasurys,  compared with 0.58 percentage point for a 10-year bond last year.

|Feb. 29, 2016, 10:53 AM|Bloomberg: Exxon plans bond offering, eyeing assets on the cheap

 Exxon Mobil (XOM +0.1%) may be preparing to tap the bond market, as Bloomberg reports the company may sell debt in as many as nine parts for general corporate purposes. The longest portion of the offer reportedly is a 30-year bond yielding 1.75-1.8 percentage points more than comparable government debt; XOM also is said to be selling 10-year and 7-year bonds. As XOM likely does not need cash for anything in the near term, the debt offer may be a sign that the company intends to "start picking up great assets at fire-sale prices" and "take advantage of the downturn and start shopping." Moody’s cut XOM's outlook to negative last week, warning that the crude oil collapse imperils cash flow XOM needs to cover debt payments and investment in new discoveries; S&P made a similar move earlier this month. |Feb. 25, 2016, 5:58 PM|Exxon's AAA rating affirmed by Moody's but outlook turns negative


Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) retains its AAA credit rating at Moody’s but perhaps not for much longer, after the ratings agency changes its outlook to negative from stable ahead of a possible downgrade.
Moody's says XOM's negative outlook reflects its expectations of negative free cash  flow and weak cash flow based leverage metrics; while  XOM is cutting capex and operating costs, "this diminished level of capital  reinvestment could adversely affect [XOM's] reserve replacement and  production profile in the latter part of this decade."
The move by Moody’s follows a negative outlook assigned by S&P earlier this month.

 Even with the price of oil at just ~$30/bbl, the U.S. Energy Information Administration foresees crude production from the Gulf of Mexico hitting record levels in 2017. The EIA projects Gulf production - which generally is less sensitive to short-term crude pricing movement than onshore shale production - will average 1.63M bbl/day in 2016 and 1.79M bbl/day in 2017, including hitting  1.91M bbl/day in December 2017; The previous high of more than 1.7M came in 2009 ahead of the 2010 drilling moratorium after the Deepwater Horizon spill.
The low price of oil is keeping most energy companies from approving new Gulf projects, but several already are in the works, such as Shell’s (RDS.A, RDS.B) Stones and Noble Energy’s (NYSE:NBL) Gunflint.
Some of the projects already in operation include Shell’s  Perdido and Mars B projects, Exxon’s (NYSE:XOM) and Anadarko Petroleum’s (NYSE:APC)  Lucius, and NBL’s Rio Grande; APC’s Heidelberg  field just came online in January.

XOM held a massive 24.8B boe of reserves as of Dec. 31, enough to continue current rates of production for 16 years, but the total was down from 17.4 years of reserve life at the end of 2014, according to Bloomberg data. Liquid additions during 2015 totaled 1.9B barrels, but gas proved reserves fell by 834M boe; XOM says it expects the gas reserves to be developed and booked as proved reserves at some point when prices are higher.

 A mysterious oil tanker is the latest in the long list of speculated reasons why Californians pay far more for gasoline than most other U.S. drivers, the LA Times reports. Consumer advocates contend that Exxon Mobil (XOM -0.7%) could have done more to increase gasoline inventories and help lower prices in the past year after the explosion at the Torrance refinery; now they say an Exxon tanker sailed for 70 days off the coast of Singapore but never picked up fuel for California from the company's refineries in Singapore that produce the state's special blend of environmentally friendly gasoline.
The president of the Consumer Watchdog group told California's Petroleum Market Advisory Board yesterday that the ship stopped in Los Angeles after its Asian trip but did not unload any gasoline before taking its fuel to Florida.
XOM dismisses the allegations without  discussing the tanker's sailing records or deliveries. |Feb. 8, 2016, 5:21 PM|Exxon’s payout ratio could top 100% in 2016, Bespoke says

XOM is one of three U.S. companies with S&P’s highest AAA rating - which it has held since 1930 - but the ratings agency placed XOM on credit watch with negative implications because its credit measures probably will remain weak through 2018. S&P says it will decide whether to downgrade XOM within 90 days; it if chooses to make a cut, it probably would be only by a single notch.

Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) -1.9% premarket after posting a Q4 earnings beat on larger than expected revenue, but this morning's decline in WTI crude oil prices below $31/bbl poses headwinds for the broader energy sector.
XOM reports $2.78B in Q4 profit but that was 58% lower than the $6.57B in the year-ago quarter and the first time the company logged a quarterly profit below $3B since 2002.
XOM says it will cut spending this year by ~25% to $23.2B, after reducing capex by 20% in 2015 to $31B, a bigger cut than the 12% cut forecast by management in March.

Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) gains approval from Santa Barbara County, Calif., officials for its plan to use trucks to move 17M-plus gallons of oil stranded in storage tanks after a  California pipeline break in May.
The county says moving the oil from the tanks  would decrease the potential risks posed by long-term storage, since the  pipeline is expected to be inoperable for a prolonged period; critics say the county's ruling puts people and the environment at risk of "fiery accidents or another devastating oil spill."
Eight months ago, the ruptured pipeline created the largest coastal oil  spill in California in 25 years, fouling beaches near Santa Barbara and  spreading goo as far as 100 miles.

 Alberta's government says it will provide up to C$500M (US$357M) in subsidies to support new petrochemical plants, part of a plan to help diversify the province’s economy by creating higher value products from its resources. The subsidies are designed to attract two or three new petrochemical projects, each of which would be eligible for up to C$200M in credits for purchasing ethane or propane; the credits would be provided only once a facility is built and starts operating to reduce the financial risk to the province. The program follows Alberta’s review of oil and gas royalty charges, which  was unveiled Friday and said there was an opportunity to encourage  more petrochemical processing in the province.

 Investment in Canada’s oil and gas industry is forecast to fall again this year, as the price of the heavy crude produced from Alberta's oil sands has fallen so low that some companies are losing money on every barrel they sell, and are looking at ways to cut production. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers predicts the industry will invest C$42B in 2016, 13% less than in 2015 and 48% less than in 2014 - a steeper decline than investment in oil and gas production worldwide, which is expected to drop by 40% during 2014-16, according to Wood Mackenzie. On top of plummeting prices, Alberta's new left-leaning government plans to cap carbon emissions from the oil sands, a move that threatens to strand billions of barrels of crude; companies including Exxon (NYSE:XOM), BP, Chevron (NYSE:CVX), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO), Total (NYSE:TOT), Statoil (NYSE:STO) and Cnooc (NYSE:CEO) have invested in Alberta megaprojects to tap the world's third largest oil reserves, smaller only than Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. |Jan. 25, 2016, 10:48 AM|Exxon foresees global energy demand rising 25% by 2040

 Crude oil futures settled more than 4% higher  on the back of perceived oversold conditions, despite a higher than expected inventory build; March WTI jumped 4.2% to settle at $29.53/bbl after trading as high as $30.25, while Brent surged 4.9% to $29.25. 
Crude prices were supported by the inventory increase in this morning's EIA report, which was less than the API’s report released on Wednesday, says Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group; also, reports of Libyan oil tanks on fire eased speculation that Libya would be exporting more oil soon. Also supportive for prices, oil production in the lower 48 states edged lower for the first time in seven weeks, “which is at least ‘less bearish’ for the extremely oversupplied global oil market,” says Tyler Richey of The 7:00’s Report.

Of the 15 large E&Ps Oppenheimer covers, 13 likely will report losses in Q4 vs. 10 in Q3 and none in Q4 2014, with only Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) and Range Resources (NYSE:RRC) reporting a profit; the analysts expect most of the other 13 to report steeper declines, including Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC), Apache (NYSE:APA), Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG), Hess (NYSE:HES), Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO), Murphy Oil (NYSE:MUR), Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) and Southwestern Energy (NYSE:SWN).
Earlier this week, Gheit predicted that half of U.S. shale oil producers could go bankrupt before the crude market reaches equilibrium.

 Short selling in S&P 500 energy companies in December hit levels not seen since 2003, as average short interest rose to 7.28% at the end of the month from 6.59% at mid-month, Reuters reports. Companies that saw notable bets against their stocks in late December include Southwestern Energy (NYSE:SWN), with short interest up to 24.8% of its float from 17.1% just two weeks earlier, and Consol Energy (NYSE:CNX), whose short interest rose to 24.9% from 21% in mid-December; short interest in ONEOK (NYSE:OKE) rose to 6.9% from 3.9% at mid-month. Companies that short sellers reduced bets against during the period include Cimarex Energy (NYSE:XEC), Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI); among industry giants, short interest in Chevron (NYSE:CVX) edged up to 1.4% at the end of December from 1.2% while Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) held steady at 1.2%.
But with crude oil prices hitting 12-year lows and the energy sector down ~10% in the first two weeks of the new year,  some short sellers are said to have become more selective about the companies they bet against, thinking further losses may be limited.

 Nymex crude oil settled -5.7% at $29.42/bbl, its lowest level since November 2003, with concerns that Iran will soon add to the world's glut of crude supplies added to fears about an economic slowdown in China. When a decade of trade and banking sanctions against Iran end, perhaps as soon as Monday, the country could lift exports by 500K bbl/day and gradually raise shipments by the same amount again; Iran reportedly has 22 VLCCs floating off its coast, with 13 fully or almost fully loaded.

 New York’s state pension fund and the Church of England, both investors in Exxon Mobil (XOM -2.3%), say they will file a shareholder resolution demanding the company assess the impact of climate change policy on its business. Government attempts to tax or put a price on carbon, for example, could  affect the viability of some of XOM’s long-term investment plans, says the head of responsible investing for the Church of England, which has a ~£10B ($14.44B) portfolio.

Chevron (NYSE:CVX) says it is on track to export the first cargo of  liquefied  natural gas from its $54B Gorgon project in Western Australia early this year.
CVX says that in preparation for the project's start-up,  it has begun to  cool down the LNG storage and loading facilities  at the Gorgon plant.
CVX does not specify when the first cargo will be  exported, but  CEO John Watson said last year it  would be shipped in Q1 2016.
Commercial deliveries of LNG from the 15.6M metric ton/year project will go mainly to customers in Asia, although prices for the fuel in Asia have plummeted as  slowing economic growth has hurt demand growth.
CVX operates the project and holds a 47.3% stake, while  Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B)   each hold 25%.

 Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) reportedly will shut one of two crude units at its 350K bbl/day Beaumont, Tex., refinery in mid-April for up to 90 days. The planned maintenance is said to impact a 130K bbl/day crude distillation unit and related operations. Recent U.S. oil data has showed an abundance of gasoline and distillates, which may be why XOM would find it an opportune time to shut the refinery, writes Adam Button at forexlive.com. |Jan. 13, 2016, 5:25 PM|Exxon deficiencies found in California refinery blast, U.S. probe says

 An explosion at Exxon Mobil's (NYSE:XOM) Torrance, Calif., oil refinery last February could have been prevented if managers had taken into account aging safety equipment and shut down a key, spark-generating part of the refinery before attempting repairs elsewhere, according to a preliminary investigation by the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board. XOM disputes the findings in the blast, saying it has stringent safety rules and that an internal review of the incident found no protocols were violated. The head of the Board says XOM has refused to provide its investigators with nearly half of the documents they requested for the probe. Repairs are ongoing at the 149.5K bbl/day Torrance plant, which provides 10% of California's gasoline supply; XOM has hoped to restart shut units in February, but Macquarie analysts now say the restart likely will be pushed into Q2 because of setbacks in repairs, which could delay finalization of the plant's pending $537M sale to PBF Energy (NYSE:PBF). |Jan. 11, 2016, 4:00 AM|Stocks on watch for a Barron's bounce

 Saudi Aramco confirms it is studying "various options" for the  sale of shares, a day after the Saudi deputy crown prince said an  IPO of equity in the state oil giant was  being considered. 
The Economist reported yesterday that ~5% of Aramco could be  offered initially in Riyadh and more shares could be sold later, although the kingdom would retain control; in its own statement, Aramco said it is considering “the listing in capital markets of an appropriate percentages of the company’s shares and/or the listing of a bundle of its downstream subsidiaries.” Saudi Aramco had 261B barrels of proved crude oil reserves at year-end 2014, compared with less than 14B reported at the same time by Exxon Mobil; just using proved oil reserves as a benchmark for valuation, Aramco could be worth up to 20x as much as Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), the largest non-state-controlled publicly listed oil company with a market valuation of $317M.

 Oilprice.com's Michael McDonald says investors interested in energy should watch four bellwether stocks throughout 2016 to maintain a feel for the sector; Exxon Mobil (XOM -0.4%), Devon Energy (DVN -0.1%), Transocean (RIG -5.5%) and Kinder Morgan (KMI -1.7%). As the bluest of blue chips, a stable XOM would indicate that better times are coming for the rest of the sector but as long as XOM business is suffering, one can be sure that financially weaker companies are in even more distress, McDonald writes. DVN is still a favorite Wall Street name and should be one of the shale companies that emerges from the downturn well positioned to capitalize on weakness among competitors. Deepwater drilling likely will be one of the last groups to recover when oil prices start to rise, so McDonald says investors should keep an eye on RIG for a possible late inning recovery opportunity. KMI's reduced dependence on capital markets may be good for the stock in the long run, but the process of getting there has been painful, and investors should watch the stock during 2016 to assess when the pipeline group again becomes a sound investment. |Jan. 4, 2016, 9:03 AM|WisdomTree U.S. Dividend Growth ETF (DGRW) December Summary

The cost to produce crude oil from Alberta’s oil sands dropped this year after 15 years of continuous inflation, according to a new report from IHS Energy, as capital and operating costs in the region have fallen in response to collapsing global oil prices.
But the findings do not mean the oil sands are now a more competitive choice for energy companies’ investment dollars compared with shale or offshore oil formations, as costs across the global energy industry also have dropped.
The report also says 70% of oil sands production growth over the next five years will come from the expansion of existing projects, and 80% of that growth will be from steam-based, rather than mining, projects.

 Exxon Mobil's (XOM +4.3%) plan to spend ~$229M to develop the Vaca Muerta shale play in Argentina is approved by the Neuquen provincial government, which could lead to full scale  development on XOM’s holdings in the Neuquen basin.
XOM plans to drill five horizontal wells with laterals of up to 2,500 meters (8,202 ft.), and to build an oil separation and storage facility and a natural gas pipeline, among other infrastructure on the adjacent blocks.
After the pilot stage, XOM and partners plan to invest an additional $13.8B in the mass development of the blocks by drilling 556  horizontal wells, the government says. XOM is today's best performing stock among the 30 Dow components thanks to a snap-back in crude oil prices.

Alberta's energy minister has said any changes in royalty rates would not take effect before 2017, a move intended to ease the impact on the energy industry.

 The energy sector (-4.5%) paces the opening decline, as WTI crude oil prices -4% at $38.35/bbl following a 2.7% slide on Friday after OPEC's failure to agree on a production target to reduce the oil glut. Investors are betting on oil prices staying lower for even longer after OPEC's non-decision, pushing U.S. crude futures for delivery nearly 10 years away below $60/bbl, Reuters reports. But the oil glut is set to continue as much because of the U.S. as of OPEC, as U.S. shale drillers have only trimmed their pumping a little, and rising oil flows from the Gulf of Mexico are propping up U.S. production; the overall output of U.S. crude fell just 0.2% in September, the most recent monthly federal data available, and is down less than 3%, to 9.3M bbl/day, from the peak in April. Goldman Sachs says it expects oil prices to remain "lower for longer," with a risk that prices could fall as low as $20/bbl.

 U.S. crude oil settled 2.7% lower at $39.97 and Brent fell 1.9% to $43 after OPEC decided to roll over its policy of maintaining crude production in order to retain market share - a not unexpected outcome but one that offers no relief in sight for the oil industry's pain. "OPEC not cutting is going to put more pressure on oil prices," and the pressure on companies’ spending will feed through into their investment in increasing their production, says Jefferies equity analyst Jason Gammel. “It’s not as though they’ll shut down existing production, but over time their output will decrease." 
Don’t expect prices to stabilize until low prices force curtailments of pumping in the U.S., which will not happen until the end of next year, Goldman Sachs analyst Damien Courvalin.

XOM says it takes climate change seriously and has taken steps to reduce its own emissions, adding that the most effective solution would be a revenue neutral tax on greenhouse  gas emissions, reiterating a position the company has held for  years.
XOM has been under attack by critics  who say it misled the public by promoting uncertainties about climate  science; in a new Rolling Stone interview, Sec. of State Kerry says the company’s actions would be a "betrayal” of humanity if it is found  to have suppressed knowledge about climate risks.

The world's oil companies have canceled or delayed final investment decisions on  ~150 projects that could wipe out 19M bbl/day from the world’s hydrocarbons and stay underground for several years longer than  expected amid lower crude oil prices, according to a new report from Tudor Pickering Holt.
Canada and Norway top the investment bank’s list of deferred projects  by country, while surprisingly few deepwater projects have been deferred  in the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil.
The biggest oil companies account for a  third of the 150 projects Tudor Pickering says have been delayed or  canceled, a scale that “suggests that companies will have real growth issues toward  the end of the decade,” and some will have to buy smaller rivals to  make up for it.

BP and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) have deferred the largest number of projects, while Exxon  (NYSE:XOM) could delay the most oil barrels (~2.5M bbl/day of production capacity from 25 projects); Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) is deferring 1.7M bbl/day, but its deal to buy  BG Group and its deepwater fields off Brazil has alleviated many of the growth issues it might  otherwise face.

A 1991 civil settlement required XOM to pay the U.S. and Alaska  governments $900M over 10 years to reimburse past costs and fund  restoration of injured natural resources.
The two governments say continued wildlife monitoring shows that the harlequin ducks and sea  otters which had looked vulnerable to lingering oil in 2006 have  recovered to pre-spill population levels and are no longer exposed to  oil more than populations outside the spill area.

Given XOM's large scale, Gheit believes XOM's production growth will be both "anemic and unsustainable," and return on invested capital will fall short of historical levels even at much higher oil prices, meaning XOM needs a big deal to create long-term shareholder value through synergy benefits from cost savings and efficiency gains. Gheit expects XOM to generate operating cash flow of $34.8B this year and $34.3B next year, which will partially fund respective capex of $29.7B and $29.4B and dividends of $12.1B and $12.7B, for a cash flow deficit of $7.0B and $7.9B. |Nov. 24, 2015, 6:56 PM|Alaska completes buyout of TransCanada’s interest in gas project

 Alaska finalizes its deal to buy out TransCanada's (NYSE:TRP) share in the proposed Alaska LNG export project for $64.6M, giving the state direct ownership in the project along with partners BP, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM). The $45B-$65B project would transport natural gas from the North Slope fields, then liquefy the fuel at a facility on Cook Inlet for shipment to markets in Asia; it has not yet been approved for construction and would not start commercial shipments before 2023. The state legislature earlier this month approved funding to buy out TRP’s interest in the project. |Nov. 24, 2015, 12:49 PM|Alberta methane cut targets could add "hundreds of millions" in new costs

 Canadian oil producers may say they are on board with Alberta’s new climate change policy goals, but the  requirement that companies reduce their methane emissions by  45% will add costs "in the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars over the next five years," the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers says.
Alberta’s oil and gas sector produced 30.4 megatons of methane emissions in 2013, accounting for 70% of the province’s overall methane emissions. National Bank Financial analyst Kyle Preston calls Alberta’s climate change policy “fair and accommodating” for oil and gas companies, and says newer energy projects such as Canadian Natural Resources' (NYSE:CNQ) Horizon oil sands project and MEG Energy’s (OTCPK:MEGEF) Christina Lake facility emit less greenhouse gas than older facilities, which will be hit harder by the new policies.

Alberta's government announces plans to cap oil sands emissions for producers, phase out coal power plants and implement  a carbon tax in an effort to curb pollution. The provincial government in impose a limit of 100 megatons/year of carbon emissions, above current annual emissions of ~70 megatons, phase out coal power plants by 2030, and set a carbon price  of C$20/metric ton (US$15) by 2017 which rises to C$30 in 2018. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers supports the initiative, saying it could help improve Alberta’s image in markets to which oil sands producers hope to expand access. "This will create a wealth of opportunities and jobs for generations to  come. We in Alberta want to take a leadership role on climate," says Suncor (NYSE:SU) CEO Steve Williams. Coal producers criticized the new policy, however, saying it will raise electricity costs in Alberta and cost Canadian jobs.

 Production from Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale play is expected to double by 2018, according to a new development study by Wood Mackenzie. The study says oil and gas output from the play will be moderate in 2016, with a Y/Y production increase of 10%, but the increase will see a sharp upturn by 2020. The consultant sees ~200 wells brought online in the region in 2015, with fewer in 2016 as vertical wells are phased down.
In order to fully develop Vaca Muerta, the study suggests that more joint  venture deals will be necessary, as YPF will need outside assistance to develop the 6.3M acres it holds.

 A Dutch court orders more cuts in gas production at the Groningen field in The Netherlands, saying the government had given too little consideration to earthquakes caused by gas extraction. The court says output at Europe's largest gas field will now be  capped at 27B cm/year from 33B cm through October 2016, adding that the government had failed to sufficiently weigh public safety risks.
Production already had been cut twice this year from  an original target of 39.4B cm, sending regional prices higher. The Groningen field is operated by a joint venture including Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and the Dutch government.

Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is downgraded to Underperform from Market Perform at Raymond James, which says XOM's limited leverage to oil prices will act as a hindrance  during an expected modest oil price recovery in 2016.
Analyst Pavel Molchanov says the downgrade is not a short-term trading call but a 6-12 month time  horizon, which could prove wrong if oil spends the year below $50/bbl.
Molchanov expects XOM shares to be a source of funds for investors turning more constructive on oil in 2016.

 Low crude prices have caused oil companies to cut spending but they are still protecting their hefty dividends, WSJ reports, as the four supermajors - Exxon (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) and BP - have distributed nearly $28B to their shareholders YTD, ~10% more than the same period in 2014, and as their collective earnings have fallen by more than 70%. The payments to investors come amid $22B in reduced spending on exploration and development of oil fields, and 80 scrapped or delayed projects so far this year, according to BP E&P chief Lamar McKay.
The supermajors have little choice but to pay fat dividends to keep investors, but it is a potentially risky strategy given concerns about the length of the oil price downturn and its impact on cash flow; dividend yields oil companies made last quarter are at the highest level in  more than a decade, according to FactSet.
But investors are hooked:  CVX has increased its annual per-share dividend for each of the last  28 years, XOM has raised its dividend by an average of 6.4% every  year for the last 33 years, and Shell and BP have reiterated that maintaining  returns to shareholders is a priority. |Nov. 16, 2015, 9:59 AM|Exxon, Rosneft have long-term partnership, Russian energy official says

 Russia's first deputy natural resources minister says the partnership between Rosneft (OTC:RNFTF) and Exxon Mobil (XOM +0.7%) is "long-term," when asked about talks between Rosneft and Chinese firms on their possible participation in offshore Arctic projects. Russia's RIA news agency had quoted Russian Deputy Energy Minister Yanovsky as saying Rosneft wanted to allow Chinese companies to take part in its offshore Arctic projects.

 The number of oil wells in North Dakota that have been drilled but not fracked surpassed 1,000 for the first time in September, as producers wait for prices to recover before turning them on. As a result, more than 8% of oil wells in North Dakota now are sitting idle, harming the industry's ability to grow production; daily output in the state fell 2% in September to ~1.16M bbl/day. The backlog is "sending a definite signal to the market that oil and gas operators are not willing to do a lot of drilling or hydraulic fracturing or production at these low prices," says Lynn Helms, director of the state's Department of Mineral Resources, who figures the backlog is not likely to be worked off until next year at least, and only if oil prices rise.

 Israel's energy minister says the country is encouraging global oil companies to further explore its offshore waters for natural gas, adding that he has met senior execs of more than 20 energy companies, including Eni (NYSE:E), Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Hess (NYSE:HES) to gauge interest. Yuval Steinitz estimates 350T-530T cf of gas, or at least 60B boe, in the whole of the eastern Mediterranean basin, which includes Israeli, Egyptian and Cypriot waters. Steinitz also says a framework agreement on two gas fields would be signed off by the prime minister this year and that exploration for more fields could begin thereafter; Noble Energy (NYSE:NBL) and Delek (OTCPK:DGRLY) had been negotiating long-term contracts to sell gas from the fields to companies in Egypt, but the deals were delayed by bureaucratic hurdles in Israel.

 Executives from Exxon Mobil (XOM +0.1%), BP (BP -0.5%) and Total (TOT -0.9%) tell an oil industry conference in Abu Dhabi that the global oil glut is likely to last longer than expected and may depress oil prices for many more months if not years. BP's and XOM's heads of exploration and production Lamar Mckey and Jack Williams both say low  oil prices likely will stay for a while, and BP's Middle East chief Michael Townshend says he foresees oil fluctuating ~$60/bbl for another three years. But the oil industry is quickly becoming more efficient by learning how to recover more resources from existing fields; Williams cites the 36% decline in the cost of well drilling in North Dakota over the past four years while generating higher production. |Nov. 9, 2015, 7:23 PM|Exxon, Total team up to drill Uruguay's first offshore well

 Apache (APA +14.3%) shares reach their highs of the day after a report that the company had rejected a takeover offer after a suitor was lured by APA's $1.6B in cash and low leverage to help strengthen its balance sheet and fund a dividend. One analyst thinks Hess (HES -0.8%) and Murphy Oil (MUR +0.5%) - with strong balance sheets and which have materially underperformed in 2015 as investors have focused on E&Ps with longer life onshore portfolios - also could be buyout targets. But shares of APA’s peers have enjoyed little benefit from the report, which Heard On The Street's Spencer Jakab says suggests that the bargains on offer among North American oil and gas producers are not compelling enough to kick off a round of consolidation and that the list of buyers is short.

 The New York attorney general's investigation of Exxon Mobil's (XOM -1.8%) record on climate change may prompt legal inquiries into other oil companies, NY Times reports, citing legal and climate experts. Prosecutors could decide to probe companies that funded or joined groups that questioned climate science or policies designed to address the problem to see if  discrepancies exist between the companies’ public and private statements, according to the report. For example, internal documents discussing climate change from companies belonging to the Global Climate Coalition - including XOM, BP, Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) and Texaco (now part of Chevron CVX) - could contradict what the companies said as part of the group, which disbanded in 2002. Energy experts say it would be harder to make cases against oil companies than it was against tobacco companies that deliberately hid research from their customers, since many oil company scientists, including those of XOM, have presented papers on climate change  publicly at conferences and contributed to research of groups concerned with the issue. |Nov. 5, 2015, 3:33 PM|NYT: Exxon climate statements under NY AG scrutiny

 The New York attorney general's office has launched a sweeping investigation of Exxon Mobil (XOM -1.2%) to determine whether the company lied to the public about the risks of climate change or to investors about how those risks might hurt the oil business, NY Times reports. AG Eric Schneiderman is said to have issued a subpoena last night to XOM demanding extensive financial records, emails and other documents. XOM has denied allegations it has suppressed climate change research, and has said it had funded mainstream climate science since the 1970s. The report also says coal producer Peabody Energy (BTU +6.2%) has been under investigation by the AG for two  years over whether it properly disclosed financial risks related to climate change but has not resulted in any charges or other legal action. |Nov. 2, 2015, 5:22 PM|Exxon breakout may be bullish sign for crude oil prices


Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) has climbed above three key technical levels,  suggesting further gains ahead for the shares and possibly for crude  oil prices, MarketWatch's Tomi Kilgore writes.
XOM shares surged 3% today to break above their 200-day moving average, have run up more than 20% since it closed at a four-year low of $68.71 on Aug. 25, and earlier this month climbed above a 15-month downtrend line that coincided with the downtrend in crude oil prices.
Although crude oil futures prices remain below their 200-day MA, some analysts think XOM's rise foreshadows a similar breakout in oil prices; since XOM represents a noteworthy chunk of the oil market, “if you’re bullish on Exxon, you have to be bullish on oil, too," says RBC's Brad Heffern.

 Oil companies including ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and BP have benefited from years of tax breaks offered by the state of Alaska, but now state leaders want to cut back the subsidies since crude oil prices have plunged and Alaska likely lost $263M on its oil production tax program in the past year, WSJ reports. The subsidy program "began for all the right reasons, and it’s reached a point beyond our fiscal appetite," Gov. Walker says, but "we can no longer subsidize exploration." The dilemma for Alaska is that if it cuts back subsidies and increases oil tax revenue, it could lose money in the long run if it discourages drillers from tapping its reserves; oil money usually makes up 90% of the state budget and funds dividend checks to every Alaskan.

 Spending on new projects, share buybacks and dividends at four of the biggest oil companies - Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), BP, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) - outstripped cash flow by more than a combined $20B in H1 of this year, according to a WSJ analysis.
The cash crunch underscores the cloudy future facing the four Big Oil stalwarts amid a 16-month slump in oil prices, and analysts expect the companies to reveal continuing cash flow shortfalls  when they report earnings this week after a quarter in which oil prices fell to their lowest levels since the financial crisis; Brent  crude averaged ~$50/bbl in Q3 vs. more than $60/bbl in Q2 and ~$100 in 2014.
Moody's recently said it expected the world’s integrated oil companies will have a combined cash flow deficit of as  much as $80B this year and $55B next year at current price  levels.
Even with the cash flow problems, the companies maintain strong balance  sheets, and their refining  and marketing divisions have cushioned the blow of the market turmoil, along with  cost-cutting and planned asset sales.

 Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) responded this week to mounting calls for a federal investigation into accusations that the company has known for decades about the risks of burning fossil fuels and the effects on climate change, and that it has withheld the information and sought to sow doubt among the public. XOM once embraced climate science but seems to have shifted its corporate view by 1990 after growing wary of government and regulatory efforts that could "alter profoundly the strategic direction of the  energy industry," and that the impact on the company from  those efforts “will come sooner... than from climate change itself.”
Blasting the allegations as “inaccurate and deliberately misleading," XOM says "activists deliberately cherry-picked statements attributed to various       company employees to wrongly suggest definitive conclusions were reached       decades ago by company researchers." The scandal has implications beyond just XOM, as other oil  companies that conducted their own research also could  face public scrutiny about what they knew about climate change,  when they knew it and how they responded to it. |Oct. 22, 2015, 6:25 PM|North Dakota adds extra year to bring new wells online

Morgan's Phil Gresh writes. The analyst sees an opportunity for CVX to take a step forward with rebuilding investor confidence around the long-term cost reduction and dividend coverage story, although the real uplift will have to come with an on-time Gorgon startup, which is still slated for Q1 2016; he rates the stock as Overweight. JPM has lowered its 2016-18 EPS estimates for natural gas prices in North America and Europe, which now show limited potential for recovery over the next few years and are considered most impactful for Neutral-rated XOM and CNQ and Underweight-rated COP. |Oct. 5, 2015, 7:45 PM|Suncor's bid for Canadian Oil Sands "ridiculous," major shareholder says


Suncor Energy's (NYSE:SU) C$4.3B hostile takeover bid for Canadian Oil Sands (OTCQX:COSWF) is "not a low-ball offer, it’s a no-ball offer,” according to billionaire Seymour Schulich, who owns 25M shares, or 5%, of the company and says he is not selling at the offer price.
Schulich says SU's proposal is worth less than half the replacement value of the Syncrude Canada joint venture, of which COSWF owns 37%, and that Imperial Oil (NYSEMKT:IMO) recently built the Kearl oil sands project at a cost of $13B, which produces lower-grade oil than the Syncrude project.
Analysts are split on whether the deal was a good one for COSWF shareholders; National Bank Financial's Kyle Preston calls the bid “a positive deal" and raises the possibility that IMO, along with parent company Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), could launch a competing bid, but Barclays’ Paul Cheng, among others, does not believe IMO will make a bid.

 Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) says it has started the third phase of its Bonga field off Nigeria's coast, as it pushes ahead with projects close to production.
Bonga phase 3 has a peak production capacity of ~50K boe, while the floating  production and storage facility serving the third phase has a  capacity of more than 200K bbl/day of oil and 150M cf/day of natural gas.

 The energy sector is an early leader in today's trading even after Standard & Poor's issued negative outlooks for Exxon Mobil (XOM +0.3%) and Chevron (CVX +1.9%) after Friday's close, citing high debt levels and low energy prices. XOM "has substantially more debt than during the last cyclical commodity price trough in 2009, while upstream production and costs are at similar levels,” S&P said, adding that “a sustained period of lower oil and gas prices will significantly reduce the company’s operating cash flow in 2015 and 2016 from 2014 levels, resulting in rising debt balances as the company sustains its capital investments and dividends.” The ratings agency anticipates CVX "will outspend internally generated cash flow to fund major project capital spending and dividends." While S&P stopped short of credit downgrades - it held CVX’s long-term credit rating at AA and XOM’s at AAA - it did downgrade 12 others: CHK, WLL, UPL, DNR, LINE, BBG, LGCY, TPLM, ARP, CWEI, MPO, EXXI.

 Alaska's government reaches a tentative agreement with the North  Slope’s three major producers - Exxon Mobil (XOM -1.1%), ConocoPhillips (COP -0.3%) and BP (BP +0.9%) - over payments for impacts on communities  during the construction of a proposed major gas project and property taxes once gas starts to flow. The deal calls for $800M in payments for impacts occurring during construction, with an expected payout over five years, which could include additional police, teachers and wage inflation; the agreement also has a  targeted amount of $15.7B for a flow-related property tax paid out over 25 years. An XOM spokesperson says the tentative agreement is an important step toward advancing the project. Gov. Walker has called a special session for late October to consider buying out TransCanada’s (TRP +0.2%) position in the project, as well as a reserve tax on undeveloped North Slope gas; no decision has been made yet on whether to build the project, which oil-dependent Alaska sees as critical to its economic future. |Sep. 30, 2015, 4:45 PM|PBF Energy to buy troubled Torrance refinery from Exxon for $537M

 PBF Energy (NYSE:PBF) +8% AH after agreeing to acquire the 155K bbl/day Torrance, Calif., refinery and related logistics assets from Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) for $537M. The refinery has been shut down since an explosion in February injured four contractors and caused heavy damage, leading to a shortage of gasoline and higher prices at the pump for drivers in California. The Torrance refinery provides 10% of the state’s capacity and 20% of the capacity in Southern California, and the explosion forced XOM to cut production to less than 20%, causing the spike in gas prices. PBF says the refinery will be restored to full working order prior to close, and expects the deal to be immediately accretive to earnings. Coupled with its previously announced Chalmette acquisition, PBF says it will have increased its       refining capacity by more than 60% to ~900K bbl/day and added meaningful Gulf coast and west coast assets to its refining system. |Sep. 28, 2015, 7:19 PM|Exxon CEO: Alaska is its own worst enemy in handling vital LNG project

 Alaska wants to pivot towards liquefied natural gas as oil production slowly declines, and is trying to tackle a massive natural gas pipeline and LNG project that is stuck on the drawing board, but Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) CEO Rex Tillerson says the state has been its "own worst enemy" in handling the project. "Every governor that comes in decides they’ve got a different way of doing this, which is why it never happens," Tillerson says. "You can’t take a project that is going to take 5, 6, 7 years to execute and require $50B-$60B of capital and decide every two years you’ve got a different way to do it." Alaska's Gov. Walker, soon after he was elected last year, first proposed a competing project to the one currently under consideration; after abandoning that idea, he wants the state to pick up TransCanada’s (NYSE:TRP) stake and finance it with state resources, an option that apparently does not sit well with Tillerson. With a large and growing budget deficit, the project "has gone from a wish-list item to a must-have,” says Walker, who has summoned a special session of the legislature to begin Oct. 24; the state's serious fiscal woes will put pressure on lawmakers when they meet to discuss the project.

 Venezuela and Guyana agree to restore their respective ambassadors, in a first step toward easing tensions that flared after Exxon Mobil's (XOM -0.2%) recent discovery of oil off the coast of a disputed territory. Venezuela withdrew its ambassador to Guyana in July after demanding a halt to exploration by XOM off the disputed region, and later halted accreditation for Guyana's ambassador to Venezuela. XOM in May said it found oil in the Stabroek block under a license granted by Guyana's government but has stayed silent on the dispute. |Sep. 24, 2015, 7:15 PM|North Dakota delays plan to limit natural gas flaring

 North Dakota regulators approve an  industry-backed proposal to delay further cuts to associated gas flaring by 10 months while also easing more long-range flaring reduction  targets. Gov. Dalrymple and the two other members of the North Dakota Industrial Commission voted to change the date when companies must capture 85% of natural gas produced from their wells to Nov. 1, 2016. The regulators agreed with industry arguments that the delays and revisions were needed because of the lack of new gas capture and pipeline infrastructure, which have been delayed for a variety of reasons, including low oil and gas prices, right-of-way disputes and pad size  limitations.

Cowen analyst Sam Margolin worries about Exxon Mobil’s (NYSE:XOM) exposure to oil sands through its 70%-owned Canadian subsidiary Imperial Oil (NYSEMKT:IMO), with bitumen accounting for 19% of IMO's reserves, but he still sees option value in the oil sands business, providing leverage to a long-term price recovery.
Given XOM's overall defensive characteristics of the production profile and its cash flow balance, Margolin says he does not see challenged Canadian oil sands economics as single-handedly destructive to the business.
XOM's "overall narrower bridge to [cash flow] neutrality... establishes it as a  quality defensive play in a lower commodity price environment," Margolin writes as he reiterates his Outperform rating and $92 price target on the stock.

 New technology has the potential to more than double production from a series of proposed projects in Canada's oil sands, Imperial Oil (NYSEMKT:IMO) CEO  Rich Krüger says, an optimistic view of high-cost heavy oil operations even as they face falling investment and slumping crude oil prices. The head man at Exxon's (NYSE:XOM) Canadian subsidiary says pilot tests show a nearly 30% increase in production using a modified version of IMO's steam-assisted gravity drainage, an innovation that could help boost output from each of at least seven proposed  oil sands well projects to 55K-75K bbl/day in crude  production, up from 30K-40K bl/day at current generation well sites. Aspen, the first of the planned projects, could start as soon as 2020, but Krüger says IMO has yet to approve it amid evaluations of the business case for it and the others, each of which would cost ~C$2B to develop. |Sep. 23, 2015, 11:31 AM|Time to sell Exxon and Chevron, buy Total and Shell, analyst says

 Investors should “position themselves defensively” in the global oil supermajor sector, Macquarie analyst Iain Reed believes, foreseeing a slow oil price recovery with a risk of the 1985-90 slump repeating itself. The situation is not likely to have a positive impact on most of the supermajors, particularly in the upstream divisions of the companies, where earnings have been eroded years of significant cost inflation, Reed says. The analyst thinks Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) should be avoided, rating both stocks at Underperform; XOM is trading at an unjustified premium valuation, Reed says, and CVX's performance likely will be restricted by the slow oil price recovery. Reed rates Total (NYSE:TOT) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) with Outperform ratings, seeing TOT as a first mover in cost reduction and production growth, and Shell as an underperformer.

 Exxon Mobil (XOM +0.3%) has decided to abandon short-term repairs to its Torrance, Calif., refinery in favor of a longer-term approach that would bring the plant back to full capacity next February, oil industry analyst Bob van der Valk tells the Los Angeles Times. XOM, still at odds with California air quality regulators over a short-term fix for the company's damaged refinery, appears poised to build a new pollution control system that meets anti-pollution specifications. Since an explosion damaged the refinery last February, XOM has been proposing to use an old pollution control device, one that does not meet state air quality standards, to get the plant operating while it worked on a  permanent repair. A short-term fix could have helped lower gasoline prices in southern California to a level more in line with the lower cost in the rest of the U.S.; pump prices in the L.A. area average $3.19/gal vs. the nationwide average $2.28. |Sep. 18, 2015, 11:35 AM|Bloomberg: Exxon eyeing acquisitions in west Texas' Permian region

 Exxon Mobil (XOM -1.9%) is actively hunting for shale bargains in west Texas, as executives with its XTO Energy shale drilling unit meet with small, closely held producers in the Permian Basin to negotiate possible purchases and joint ventures, Bloomberg reports. XOM is expanding its use of a new strategy first deployed in the region last  year that offers operators a cut of future proceeds rather than big  upfront stock or cash payouts, according to the report.
XOM has bought drilling rights or funded partnerships in five Permian  Basin transactions during the past 20 months, and now  controls drilling rights to 1.5M acres in the Permian region,  more than twice the size of its holdings in Iraq or the U.K. sector of  the North Sea.

Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) faces more delays in ramping up production at its Torrance, Calif., refinery following an acid leak and ongoing issues in negotiations with state regulators.
In deciding to delay the refinery ramp for the third time with no new date set yet, the South Coast Air Quality Management District said today's scheduled  hearing was postponed until XOM “can agree to terms and  conditions ensuring that sufficient safeguards are in place to protect  the public’s health.”
Also, two California Democrats in the U.S. House have written to the U.S. Chemical Safety Board asking for a Sept. 6 acid leak at the refinery to be included in the broader  investigation of XOM’s operations.
Meanwhile, California continues to suffer the highest gasoline prices in the U.S. behind Alaska, partly because of supply shortage due to the Torrance refinery outage.

 J.P. Morgan analysts met with Exxon Mobil’s (XOM +0.7%) VP of investors relations and liked what they heard, but not enough to change their Neutral rating even as the stock could represent an attractive opportunity for energy investors with a longer-term view.
XOM expects to be one of the few companies that can counter-cyclically invest to improve through-the-cycle returns, but the firm remains cautious around supply resilience, suggesting the current cycle could take some time - say, more akin to the1980s rather than 2008-09.

 Integrated oil companies will see a huge collective negative cash flow position this year and next, with capex set to be cut further as oil prices struggle to a minimal increase in 2016, according to a Moody's forecast. Despite cost cuts, Moody’s still expects the industry to face a 20% contraction in 2015 free cash flows to a negative position of nearly $80B in 2015, as the ratings agency’s outlook for the global integrated oil and gas industry remains negative into next year. Moody’s expects the industry’s total debt load will increase, with cash balances declining as companies sell assets to cover dividends and capital spending, although most companies have resisted dividend cuts so far.

A self-proclaimed "kid in a candy store" in 2011, Lowes (NYSE:L) CIO Joe Rosenberg isn't as excited now as he was then, but he remains a long-term bull and sees a few particular pockets of value.
Source: Barron's

On oil, either OPEC and non-OPEC countries reach an agreement to cut production and the price spikes upward, or there isn't an agreement and the price collapses - wiping out a lot of production. Either way, the price moves higher, says Rosenberg, and energy stocks (XLE, OIH) have likely bottomed.
Rosenberg doesn't think the dividend gets cut at Chevron (NYSE:CVX), noting board members like John Stumpf were buyers of the stock at much higher levels. "The probability of them then agreeing to a dividend cut seems somewhat remote." A similar case can be made for Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) or ExxonMobile (NYSE:XOM).
Catalysts for Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) include a breakup into three companies, and better capital allocation - notably, getting far more aggressive with share repurchases. "JNJ could raise $50B in the bond market in a heartbeat and use that money to buy back stock." Don't rule out an activist investor if management doesn't get with it.
Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) are "incredibly cheap," says Rosenberg. The strong sales pace is sustainable because the average age of cars on the road in the U.S. is about 11 years - they need to be replaced. "The stocks are discounting a very bearish scenario."

If approval comes after next week's hearing, the refinery could raise production by the end of September or early October.

The selloff in megacap oil stocks such as Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) still has not “placed them in value territory," Credit Suisse analyst Edward Westlake says.
But CVX looks like the most interesting of the four, Westlake says, as it will have an increased share of long lived cash flows to support the 5.6% dividend yield once Gorgon and Wheatstone are on stream; he also likes CVX's "enviable position" in the Permian, some giant discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico and a profitable expansion of Tengiz.
XOM is well run with an excellent balance sheet and lower cost of capital, but is not immune from a collapse in revenues, according to Westlake.
COP's cash flow will benefit from new projects, cost cutting and shale growth over the next few years, but its $3.6B/year dividend outlay may be better off redeployed into its low cost shale portfolio, the analyst says.

 Citigroup's energy analysts defend their bullish take on big oil stocks such as ConocoPhillips (COP -2.6%), Total (TOT -2.1%) and Statoil (STO -4.5%), pointing to 30-year valuation lows, upside asymmetric risk on oil prices and signs that managements are doing enough to turn the corner on better capital allocation and cost-cutting. Favoring COP, TOT and STO, the firm says its sector investment criteria are (1) growth - companies that have near-term growth are less reliant on simply cutting costs; (2) better capital allocation - combined with growth, it should deliver 2-3x the ROE uplift than cost-cutting can; and (3) a strong enough balance sheet to manage the early part of the cycle.

XOM is seeking approval to use an old pollution control system  in place of one damaged in a February explosion at the Torrance  refinery; the old pollution control equipment releases more pollutants  in violation of air quality standards.
Since the February explosion, Torrance has run at less than  20% of its normal operations, contributing to high gasoline prices in  California and the Los Angeles region; use of the old pollution control system would increase Torrance's operations to ~85%.

Pres. Obama - visiting Alaska this week - agreed earlier this month to allow Royal Dutch Shell to  resume Arctic oil exploration, yet Alaska officials say it may not be  enough to save the 800-mile Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, the state’s economic lifeline for the past 40 years.
Volume on the pipeline, which funnels crude to Valdez in the south from  Prudhoe Bay in the north, has declined along with North Slope oil production  during the past three decades; flows are dropping ~5%/year  and slid to 513K bbl/day in 2014 from a peak of 2M in  1988.
Alaska projects North Slope crude production to fall to ~320K bbl/day by 2024, and officials say a drop below 300K would trigger a “fundamental change” in operations and perhaps make the pipeline unfeasible.

 West Texas crude oil surged 8.8% to $49.19/bbl, capping a three-day rally that added more than 27% to the price - the largest three-day rally since January 2009 - after U.S. oil production data showed output falling and OPEC said it would talk with other producers about low prices. Brent crude rallied 7.4% to $53.80, as the spread between the two benchmarks widened to more than $5 intraday after narrowing to $4.33. "Oil markets are hungry for any evidence of a fall in production, anywhere,” says Global Hunter's Robert Hastings.

 The $225M settlement approved last week between Exxon Mobil (XOM -0.3%) and New Jersey confirms the company must clean up more than 1,500 contaminated properties from  gas stations to refineries, but no one can say exactly how much the company will spend or how long the cleanup will take, which has outraged environmental groups.
An XOM spokesperson says the cleanup may take years, while the state's Department of Environmental Protection says the  extent of contamination and the geology of each site will be among the  issues that will determine the timetable; bigger sites, such as some named in the settlement, could take decades.
The total cost of cleanup also is unclear; XOM has spent nearly  $260M since 1991 to clean up the Bayonne and Linden refinery sites  and could spend "in the hundreds of millions range," the Superior Court  judge wrote in his judgment. |Aug. 31, 2015, 7:12 AM|Canadian Oil Sands halts crude production at Syncrude after fire

 Canadian Oil Sands (OTCQX:COSWF) says it has halted crude oil production at the Syncrude oil sands project after a fire damaged equipment at its processing facility in northern Alberta on  Saturday. COSWF says the main coker conversion units were not damaged and Syncrude continues to operate, but it has suspended synthetic crude oil production and is currently developing a recovery plan. The company does not estimate the volume or value of lost production, but Syncrude’s synthetic crude output averaged 207.7K bbl/day in Q2. COSWF holds a 37% stake in Syncrude, and six other companies own the rest, including lead operator Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) unit Imperial Oil (NYSEMKT:IMO), Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU), Sinopec (NYSE:SNP) and Cnooc (NYSE:CEO) subsidiary Nexen.

 The silver lining for integrated energy companies during the oil price rout - refining - shows signs of fading, as analysts and executives eye prospects for lower refining profits in H2 of this year as summer gasoline consumption eases, WSJ reports. Jefferies analysts warn that “signs of weakness have appeared more broadly" for refiners, citing average global refining margins that contracted 15% last week. Refining profits are not expected to crash as oil prices have, and major oil firms’ downstream businesses likely will continue to perform reasonably well as weak oil prices and rising consumption aid their performance. But headwinds are building, especially in Europe: Stocks of gasoline and diesel are near record highs in northwest Europe, according to the IEA, and European refiners that still suffer from overcapacity in many markets are now facing new competitors. The prospect of reduced refining profits portends just how bad life could get for major companies such as Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), BP and Total (NYSE:TOT) as they cope with the continuing plunge in crude oil prices, according to the report. |Aug. 28, 2015, 12:50 PM|Exxon, Pertamina to invest $2B-plus in Indonesian gas fields

Dividends of oil E&P companies such as Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) are “mostly safe" in the shaky commodity landscape despite Chesapeake Energy’s decision to suspend its payout, says Raymond James' Pavel Molchanov and his analyst team.
Although the firm projects only one company - APC - out of 18 to fully cover the 2016 dividend payout out of cash flow at strip pricing, dividends likely will not be cut since "all the companies that have a healthy balance sheet today should still have a healthy balance sheet at the end of 2016, even if they maintain the current dividend."
The only dividend payers with a current net debt/cap ratio above 50% are DNR and CRC - a red flag, but both companies’ dividend payouts represent quite small amounts of outlays relative to cash flow, the firm says, adding that the only companies whose leverage is likely to be lower at year-end 2016 than it was in Q2 2015 are HES and QEP.
Among large-caps, the highest current leverage is at APC, at 45%, and NBL, at 38%, while the companies with the lowest current leverage are CVX, OXY and XOM, all at 15% or lower.

Walker estimates buyout costs would total ~$100M. The other partners in the project are Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), BP, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and the Alaska Gasline Development Corp., which would hold the state's interest in liquefaction facilities.

 Chevron (CVX -5%) is upgraded to Neutral from Underperform with a $100 price target at BofA Merrill, which expects CVX’s net debt to stabilize with major projects beginning to contribute in 2017 and a drop in spending to maintenance levels. The firm says it has been concerned throughout the past year that CVX's cash burn would dilute equity value through peak spending at the same time that oil prices collapsed, but it no longer sees a risk, as CVX is discounting below strip prices but with a dividend. CVX requires sustained spending of $15B-$16B to hold production flat for an extended period,” BofA's Doug Leggate explains, adding that at $45-$50 oil, cash flow by 2017 would be closer to $29B so that the dividend is "more than covered" by cash flow in an ex-growth environment. ConocoPhillips (COP -6.2%) is the firm's top pick among the big oils after the stock has been hit hard, which the analyst thinks reflected unwarranted concerns regarding COP's dividend; at current strip prices, Leggate believes COP's upside is second only to Buy-rated Exxon Mobil (XOM -5.3%). However, the firm downgrades HollyFrontier (HFC -3.5%), Marathon Petroleum (MPC -7.2%) and Valero (VLO -4.7%) to Underperform and cuts Continental Resources (CLR -10.1%), Marathon Oil (MRO -8.4%), Noble Energy (NBL -5.4%) and Whiting Petroleum (WLL -8%) to Neutral. |Aug. 21, 2015, 1:31 PM|Crude oil enters the $30s

Having been "multi-year cautious" on Big Oil, Citigroup's Alastair Syme is getting more bullish, believing current valuations are giving very little chance to the restoration of the group's long-term profitability to long-run averages.
He notes the sector price-to-book ratio of 1.2x is now below the Q1 2009 and Q4 1998 troughs, even with books marked to reflect world oil in the $50-$70 range.
"This will be a long process, but the repair (cost-cutting, better capital allocation) has now started," says Syme, recommending investors at least get to benchmark weight in the group. His favored ways to play are ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Statoil (NYSE:STO), Total (NYSE:TOT), and BG Group (OTCQX:BRGYY) as a cheaper way to get into Shell (NYSE:RDS.A).
Notably not on the list are ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) thanks to its valuation premium and low growth (through the strong balance sheet is worth a look), and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) - "slow to adjust to a lower commodity world."

Refineries running full throttle likely have delayed making much-needed repairs, and the strain is starting to show, as evidenced by a spate of refinery shutdowns across the U.S.
The recent shutdown of the BP plant in Whiting, Ind., the largest  refinery in the Midwest, is just the latest example of unplanned outages that have plagued U.S. refineries this year, including at Exxon's (NYSE:XOM) refinery in Torrance, Calif., Marathon  Petroleum's (NYSE:MPC) refinery in Robinson, Ill., and Shell's (RDS.A, RDS.B) Deer Park jet/diesel unit.
When summer driving season ends and refiners  prepare to shut down for routine fall maintenance, RBN analyst Sandy Fielden says more capacity may go  offline this year than usual as refiners catch up on repairs that  were put on the back burner while plants ran at a breakneck pace.
The expected heavier turnaround season is bad news for oil prices, Fielden says: With several refineries shutting down for weeks at a time, crude stockpiles  will start growing again in the fall since the oil has nowhere to go,  with inventories at the Cushing, Okla., hub possibly reaching  record levels.

 The Obama administration will allow limited sales of crude oil to Mexico for the first time, Reuters reports, citing a senior administration official who says the U.S. Commerce Department is "acting favorably on a number of applications" to export U.S. crude in exchange for imported Mexican oil. The shipments, likely to be lighter, high-quality  shale oil, would help Mexico's aging refineries produce more premium fuels, while U.S. refiners would continue to get Mexican heavy oil, a better match for them than the light oil coming from Texas and North Dakota. Although limited in scope, the move toward freeing up trade will please U.S. oil producers such as Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), which say the restrictions force them to sell oil at below global market rates, and may add momentum to efforts mostly to repeal what advocates see as a relic of the 1970s.

Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) reportedly could ramp up gasoline production as soon as late  September at its damaged Torrance, Calif. refinery if it can gain regulatory approval.
XOM filed an application yesterday to set a Sept. 2 hearing on permission to  restart an old electrostatic  precipitator while equipment damaged in the blast is still  being repaired, says an official at the South Coast Air Quality Management District regulating body in California; if XOM gets permission to install the old ESP, the refinery would have permission to operate at 65% capacity  because the older equipment emits more carbon and pollution.
The official says it may take several more months to repair the ESP that exploded in February from a pressure buildup.

 Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is fined more than $560K for workplace safety and health violations following an investigation into February's explosion at its Torrance, Calif., refinery that injured four workers. California’s Division of Occupational Safety and Health, the state’s workplace safety regulator, issued 19 citations to XOM, 18 of which were classified as serious, and said the company knew about and ignored hazardous conditions at the refinery. The refinery is critical to producing California's specialized gasoline blend designed to meet the state's tough air pollution regulations, and its fluid catalytic cracker has been shut down since the incident, contributing to high pump prices in the state. |Aug. 12, 2015, 3:58 PM|Judge OKs Exxon settlement over 2013 Arkansas oil leak

 Many oil companies have been hit hard by low crude prices, but Chevron (CVX -2.4%) also is battling its own expansion ambitions, and some analysts say CVX should abandon its goal of tapping 3.1M bbl/day of oil and gas by 2017, WSJ's Daniel Gilbert writes. CVX’s stock price has underperformed Exxon Mobil (XOM -1.7%) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A -0.6%) over the past year after topping them during the previous five years and betting more than them on huge energy projects such as the $54B Gorgon natural gas export plant in Australia. "The most important thing to preserve is value,” said IHS Energy's Lysle Brinker, and "if it means they have to sell some of their crown jewels, or small slivers of them, to raise billions of dollars and help maintain the balance sheet and the dividend, that’s what they should do." |Aug. 6, 2015, 1:09 PM|ExxonMobil increases Permian position with new deals

 Giants Exxon Mobil (XOM -4.5%) and Chevron (CVX -4.9%) finished significantly lower at the close after each attempted a midday rally, in the wake of earnings misses marked by the continuing crude supply glut and price pressure. Oil ETFs fared not much better today: USO -3.2%, OIL -3.7%. Producers have key differences that make for advantages and disadvantages, like Chevron's downstream cushion. Exxon's edge over Chevron, Liam Denning notes: M&A. Its stock is down just 19% over the past year while the sector has tumbled 47%. As oil's selling point -- big cash distribution -- gets squeezed, Exxon is in relatively good shape. It's still raising its dividend, and it's cut its projected Q3 buybacks to just $500M (vs. zero for Chevron, Shell and BP). Exxon says it shops worldwide, but the U.S. may be a more natural hunting ground. Possible targets?

 ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is down 3.3%, a day after posting a Q2 earnings beat where it cut capex but continued to expand production. Meanwhile, debate on this oil major rages around the safety of its sizable dividend (declared at $0.74 quarterly this month). Credit Suisse finds the dividend safe: "ConocoPhillips outlined how they could cover their dividend with unchanged 2017 production at a $60/bbl Brent price. This is impressive." Considering capex of $11B this year, "the project cycle helps." Meanwhile, JPMorgan thinks the dividend can't stick around in the long run: "While management did a good job of highlighting the incremental levers available to pull, our caution remains that the strategy of increasing the mix of short cycle production with high decline rates will make it more difficult to cover the sacrosanct dividend in the out years when productivity slows." Conoco's yield is now a point higher than closest peer Chevron, at 5.7%, but "without the same downstream cushion and more than twice the leverage." Today: XOM -4.6%, and CVX -5.3%, after earnings reports this morning.

Prudhoe Bay field owners BP and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) have asked Alaska  regulators to approve plans to increase the volume of natural gas allowed  to be produced and sold from the North Slope field.
The Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission has limited gas offtake at 2.7B cf/day of gas since 1977, but the two companies are asking to  increase the rate to 4.1B cf/day to supply a planned Alaska gas pipeline  and liquefied natural gas export project; a separate application for gas offtake from the Point Thomson gas field,  which also would supply the LNG Project, is expected later.
~8B cf/day of gas is now produced - along with oil - at Prudhoe,  but most is injected back underground to maintain pressure  in the reservoir to aid oil production; the concern is that if ~50% of the produced gas is shipped to markets via pipeline, there would be less gas injected  and less support for pressure in the reservoir, resulting in  lower oil output.
BP is the Prudhoe Bay field operator and a major stakeholder along with  XOM; ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), also a major stakeholder, was not included  in the application and says it was not aware that the other two companies would do so.

No new well completion reports have been filed in North Dakota since July 10, the longest gap this year, according to the state’s Department of Mineral Resources. The slump in reported completions is unusual and coincides with the fall in oil prices which has seen wellhead prices for Bakken crude drop below $50/bbl; Reuters' John Kemp says if the slump continues for much longer, it could be a sign that shale producers are deferring putting more wells into production to save cash and wait for better prices. The number of wells reported completed so far in July is running far below the previous level and well below the number the DMR estimates is needed to hold production steady, Kemp writes.

 In contrast to his upbeat analysis (I, II) of Exxon Mobil (XOM +1.2%), Goldman's Neil Mehta thinks investors should sell Chevron (CVX -0.2%) and Cenovus Energy (CVE -2.2%) on concerns about dividend sustainability. Believing too many investors are focusing on absolute yield when an ability to post dividend growth is more important long term, the analyst ranks CVX a Sell given low dividend growth, weak free cash flow and E&P volume risk, while CVE is a Sell because of limited dividend growth, lower returns and a premium valuation.

More on Goldman Sachs' addition of Exxon Mobil (XOM +0.7%) to its Conviction Buy list: Analyst Neil Mehta thinks the company is positioned to outperform the sector and calls the company a "rare dividend/FCF growth story among big oils." Metha highlights four key positives: improving free cash flow, driving  premium dividend growth; an inflection in production growth; strong refining earnings improvement driven by higher global crack  spreads; and investor positioning, with many large cap portfolio managers still  meaningfully underweight the stock. The analyst expects free cash flow will ramp from $9B at $57/bbl Brent in 2015 to $19B  in 2017 at $65/bbl Brent, as capex decreases and volumes improve, and believes XOM can raise its dividend, on average, by 6% through 2017 vs. zero improvement for ConocoPhillips (COP -0.7%) and just 1% for Chevron (CVX +0.3%). |Jul. 22, 2015, 8:24 AM|Exxon added to Conviction Buy List at Goldman

Repairs are moving slowly; pollution control systems damaged in the explosion  include two units with ~1,300 plates that capture fine particulate  matter, and XOM is replacing all of the plates.
XOM has asked the local air quality management district for approval to use an old pollution  control unit it replaced in 2008 to temporarily restore full operations  at the refinery, but regulators said the old equipment does not  capture emissions well enough.
Analysts had expected the refinery to return to full service in July, but now it is not expected to return to full operations for much longer - perhaps the end of the year.
Meanwhile, an ongoing inventory shortage is exacerbating the price at the pump, affecting all Californians who drive.

BP is on the hook for most of a $136M award to offshore driller  Noble Corp. (NYSE:NE) in a contract dispute over a rig that was to drill offshore Libya  in 2010, an arbitration panel finds. A Noble subsidiary initiated  arbitration proceedings in 2010 against the Libyan operating subsidiaries of  both BP and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) under a drilling contract for the Noble Homer Ferrington for operations in that country.
NE says the panel issued an award in the company's favor, and the  period when the defendants could seek clarification or correction of the  award under the applicable arbitration rules expired July 10. |Jul. 15, 2015, 2:22 PM|Oil majors pass on Mexico's first Gulf offshore auction

 Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Total (NYSE:TOT) all passed on the first 14 shallow-water oil blocks auctioned by Mexico today in the country’s first-ever sale of territory in the Gulf of Mexico. Only one of Mexico’s first five oil blocks auctioned received a qualifying bid, as a consortium of Mexico's Sierra Oil & Gas, Talos Energy and Premier Oil (OTC:PMOIF) won block no. 2 after the first block did not receive a bid. A combined offer from Murphy Oil and Petronas was the sole bid on block. no. 3 but it was disqualified because it missed the country's required 40% minimum take. The tender was the first of five in what Mexico calls Round One, which also will include subsequent auctions for onshore reserves, deepwater oil, and non-conventional reserves such as those found in shale rock formations.

 A judge rejects an attempt by environmental activists and a state lawmaker to intervene in New Jersey Gov. Christie’s decision to settle a contamination case with Exxon Mobil (XOM +0.3%) for $225M, a figure that had disappointed the activist groups after the state had once sought as much as $8.9B. The judge rules that the interests of those opposed to the settlement were adequately represented by New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection, the original party in the 11-year dispute.

 The two newsletter writers with the best track record of predicting oil market moves say the bottom is near, and crude prices should rise significantly in the next few years, Mark Hulbert reports in Barron's.
Jim Stack of InvesTech Research thinks global oversupply will lessen in coming months, as U.S. drilling rig counts are down by more than half since late last year; technically, he is impressed with oil’s successful retest in March of its January low, and says the outlook will improve even more if oil remains above its March lows through August.
Kelley Wright of Investment Quality Trends believes that, so long as the focus is on blue-chip companies with strong  financials, the dividend yield is a reliable guide to over- and  under-valuation; among blue-chip energy stocks he says are undervalued since their yields now trade near the high end of their historical ranges are XOM, CVX and SLB.

Attorneys for environmental groups and a Democratic state senator  told a judge Friday they should be permitted to intervene in New Jersey  Gov. Christie’s controversial decision to settle a long-standing  contamination case with  Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) for $225M.
The activists oppose the proposed settlement on  the grounds that it is just a fraction of the $8.9B the state had  argued earlier that XOM owed, while the Christie administration and XOM say the groups and the senator do not have legal standing in the case.

 Bloomberg's Carl Pope makes the case that the largest publicly traded oil companies face a problem that will only grow worse with time: Dependence on ever higher oil prices to match their ever higher costs of discovery. Pope notes that publicly traded oil and gas companies have access to only 10% of the world’s oil reserves, and those reserves increasingly are located in areas that are among the most difficult and expensive to extract; meanwhile, more accessible, inexpensive crude reserves in places like Russia and the Persian Gulf are set aside by governments for their own national oil companies.
The columnist notes that the percentage of Exxon’s (NYSE:XOM) proven reserves made up of tar sands and heavy oil increased from 15% in 2006 to 32% by 2013, and relying on a larger share of more expensive oil has worn on XOM's margins and returns.

Guyana's new president says he has assured Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) that exploration work at the company's recent oil discovery off the coast will not be interrupted, despite  Venezuela’s recent revival of a century-old claim on two-thirds of  Guyana’s territory.
Tensions between the countries have risen since XOM’s discovery last month, with  Venezuela issuing a decree reasserting its sovereignty over the Louisiana-sized Essequibo region’s  land and its Atlantic waters, where XOM has the exploration concession  from Guyana.
XOM has suffered strained relations with Venezuela after the country  nationalized its heavy oil projects in 2007, for which  an arbitration court has ruled Venezuela must pay XOM $1.6B.
The prospect for oil also has attracted Repsol (OTCQX:REPYY, OTCPK:REPYF), which Guyana’s government says has requested a six-month extension on its offshore exploration license.

Analysts say yesterday's release of a landmark EPA study that  found fracking had no widespread impact on drinking water makes it less likely that the Obama administration or Congress will strip a 2005 exemption of fracking from drinking water laws and that the EPA will move to tighten rules on disclosure of the chemicals used  and limits on the methane emitted.
"The EPA fracking study does not appear likely to spur additional  federal water regulation beyond initiatives that are already in  process," ClearView Energy Partners analyst Kevin Book writes.
That’s seen as good news for companies such as Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), the largest oil services companies, as well as producers such as Exxon  Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), as they weather lower oil  and natural gas prices.

Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is at a crossroads, FT's Ed Crooks, writes: Is XOM content to accept its fate as a stable giant that has given up on long-term revenue growth, curbing capital spending and returning cash  to investors whenever possible, or should it attempt to break out by  making a large acquisition?
In the 15 years since XOM bought Mobil, the company has returned $342B to investors in dividends and buybacks, but its oil and gas production is lower now than it was immediately after the purchase.
If XOM seeks stronger growth, an acquisition is the only choice, says RBC analyst Brad Heffern, but he says the problem is  that all the financially weak companies XOM might be able to buy  at attractive valuations do not have the kind of world-class assets it wants, and the strong companies that do have the assets  are priced at valuations that would make it hard for a deal to work.
Crooks considers Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC), with its excellent assets in the Gulf of Mexico, U.S. shales and in Africa, including a large presence in gas discoveries, as the best fit out of many potential acquisition candidates.

 Claims that Iran could increase overseas crude sales by 1M bbl/day soon after sanctions are lifted are "an illusion,” but the country could boost its oil exports by 400K bbl/day in the first months,  according to Iranian economist and managing partner of management consultant Atieh International, Bijan Khajehpour. Returning to higher, pre-sanctions crude production levels will take ~18 months, Khajehpour says, because of the time lag for sanctions relief to be implemented and for Iran to restore its production  capacity, but that means Iran could be exporting 2.5M bbl/day by early 2017. Iran has ~20M barrels of crude stored on tankers that it has been unable to sell due to sanctions that went into effect in mid-2012, which would allow it to rapidly add to its exports. Meanwhile, Iran is said to be prepared to offer much better commercial terms to foreign companies prepared to invest to help revitalize its ailing oil industry than offered during the last market opening nearly two decades ago. Iran is likely to test the appetite of foreign oil groups this week during a conference before the OPEC meeting in Vienna attended by the heads of oil majors Exxon (NYSE:XOM), Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), BP and Total (NYSE:TOT).

 Exxon Mobil (XOM +0.1%) says it will ask Santa Barbara County, Calif., for permission to temporarily transport its crude oil in trucks after a pipeline it was using ruptured two weeks ago, spilling more than 100K gallons of oil off the coast. XOM says the pipeline, owned by Plains All American Pipeline (PAA +1.5%), pumped ~30K bbl/day of crude oil from its Las Flores Canyon facility to a pumping station in Gaviota, where the crude then continued on to refineries inland. PAA says the pipeline has been out of service since the spill and that no timeline for restarting the pipeline has been set as federal regulators investigate the cause of the spill. |Jun. 2, 2015, 11:30 AM|Exxon CEO calls on Europe to embrace fracking

 Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) CEO Rex Tillerson calls on European governments to open up access for companies to use fracking to extract natural gas resources. Speaking at the World Energy Conference in Paris, Tillerson said demand for natural gas is expected to grow substantially over the coming decades, and allowing energy companies to use hydraulic fracturing to drill would bring benefits to both Europe and global markets. The CEO noted that U.S. natural gas production has increased by 60B cf/day  to ~75B cf/day since 1990 while emissions of both carbon dioxide  and methane have declined over the period, and "we can do the same in Europe." Governments have a “special role” to play in facilitating energy development, Tillerson said, because "only governments provide access." |Jun. 1, 2015, 3:49 PM|Exxon wins DoE approval for wider LNG exports at proposed Alaska terminal

 Canadian oil industry executives say the new plan by Alberta's premier to boost job creation by increasing oil refining and processing in the province instead of elsewhere is an unrealistic "dream" because costs and infrastructure needed for such facilities make it difficult to achieve.
"There are huge hurdles," a Canadian Natural Resources (NYSE:CNQ) VP said  at an RBC Capital conference in New York, such as the fact that U.S. refineries are already set up to handle the heavy  crude that Alberta produces: “The best economic solution is to get that  crude to these facilities,” said an exec at Imperial Oil (NYSEMKT:IMO), the Canadian company majority owned by Exxon (NYSE:XOM).
Building a refinery in Alberta would have cost Husky Energy (OTCPK:HUSKF) double  what it ended up paying for stakes in existing facilities in Ohio, according to the company's COO.
The focus on creating jobs should not trump economics, Suncor (NYSE:SU) CFO Alister Cowan told the conference. |May 29, 2015, 5:25 PM|EIA: Marcellus Shale faces weakening output due to low gas prices

 Natural gas production in the Marcellus shale, which has grown over the past decade from near zero to ~20% of U.S. output, may decline for the first time if prices in the basin remain low for much longer, the U.S. Energy Information Administration says. "Relatively low gas prices, combined with low oil prices, have slowed drilling in the Marcellus so production from new wells is only offsetting the decline in old wells," EIA says, expecting Marcellus output to remain flat through 2018 before declining ~1%/year during 2019-25. Recent data indicates a potential slowdown: The number of rigs in the area has dwindled to its lowest since 2011, and drillers including Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) and Cabot Oil & Gas (NYSE:COG) have  temporarily shut in some production due to weak regional prices. An inability to move all the gas out of the Marcellus region has depressed prices there compared with the Gulf coast benchmark, the Henry Hub in Louisiana, making it less attractive for local producers to drill more.
Other top Marcellus producers include RRC, RDS.A,  RDS.B, TLM, APC, ATLS, CVX, CNX,  EQT, EOG, XOM, WPX, XCO, CRZO, SWN, AR.

 Exxon Mobil’s (NYSE:XOM) liquidity rating was downgraded this week from "strong” to  “adequate” by Standard & Poor’s, in the latest sign of the massive impact of lower oil prices on the energy industry.
S&P did not strip away XOM’s coveted AAA credit rating - in fact, the ratings agency affirmed the rating  and called it “stable” - but the loss of the "strong" liquidity  rating is an indication that while XOM is still flush with cash, it is no longer  quite as strong as before.
Specifically, S&P noted that XOM is on the hook for $59.3B in projected capital spending in 2015, current debt maturities  and upcoming dividends and stock buybacks, while the company has  $90.5B in cash and short-term investments, untapped credit lines  and expected cash from operations this year and next. |May 27, 2015, 6:39 PM|Chevron investors OK proxy access in non-binding vote, Exxon just misses

 Chevron (NYSE:CVX) shareholders vote to give large investors the power to nominate directors to the company’s board, with 55% of votes cast favoring a proposal to give shareholders proxy access rights. The vote is not binding and CVX had opposed the proposal, warning it could create “significant risk" for investors, but CEO John Watson says the board will “consider the final voting results  carefully, including the vote on proxy access and the thoughtful stockholder discussions on that issue." Supporters of the proposal think it would encourage CVX’s  directors to address the long-term risks to the company’s business posed  by climate change. The  rule would allow investors who have owned 3% or more of CVX’s shares for at least three years to nominate directors for up to a quarter of the current board’s seats. A similar resolution came close to passing today at Exxon Mobil's (NYSE:XOM) annual meeting, where a proxy access proposal was supported by 49.4% of the shares voted. |May 27, 2015, 12:19 PM|Shareholders press for board voice on climate at Exxon, Chevron

 Proposals for Exxon Mobil (XOM -0.1%) and Chevron (CVX +0.3%) to nominate directors with climate change expertise, set greenhouse gas targets and compile reports on minimizing fracking risks are among resolutions being voted on today as the two biggest U.S. oil companies hold their shareholder meetings. Climate proposals regularly surface at  oil company annual meetings, but today will mark the first  time shareholders at XOM will vote on adding an independent climate expert to the board; the measure also will be considered at CVX's meeting after being rejected by an average of 77% of votes cast in previous years. The companies oppose all the measures, and none are expected to pass; support for a resolution urging XOM to set goals for cutting greenhouse gases may even decline from last year's 20%, thanks to an about-face by investor advisory service ISS that supported the proposal last year but this year has urged a no vote after saying XOM already discloses sufficient emissions data. |May 27, 2015, 11:40 AM|Total reports production of 2B barrels from Angola's Block 17

 North Dakota recorded a surprising jump in oil and natural gas production in March, as producers successfully wring efficiencies out of existing operations in an attempt to maintain production even at depressed prices.

 In a stunning election result, voters in Canada's energy-rich Alberta province swept aside the four-decade hold on power by the ruling Progressive Conservative Party and elected an New Democratic Party majority government that wants to raise corporate taxes and increase oil and gas royalties. NDP leader Rachel Notley - who has vowed to raise the corporate tax rate to 12% at a time energy companies are reeling from layoffs and project cancellations amid weaker oil prices - is expected to succeed Jim Prentice as Alberta’s premier.
Notley has said she would not lobby for the proposed Keystone XL pipeline to link Alberta’s oil deposits to refineries in Texas, and that she is against the Northern Gateway pipeline from Alberta to the British Columbia coast.
She also has promised another review of oil royalties at a time other oil producing areas  around the world that are also struggling with low oil prices are  expected to make their terms more appealing.

 David Einhorn's critical presentation pushed Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) 5% lower over the past two days, but Wolfe Research's Paul Sankey is out in defense of PXD and fracking companies generally, in large part because of their “takeover attractiveness." "Pioneer is the single most attractive takeover target to Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), and the entire group Einhorn listed as short candidates based on a value-destructive business model has takeover merits," Sankey writes, adding the potential for a takeout is at least part of why the market is overvaluing PXD. Einhorn said investors in PXD and fracking companies overall - he also mentioned CXO, EOG, WLL and CLR - have been willing to largely ignore their high capital expenditures, but Sankey believes the U.S. energy revolution "is in its very early stages, and efficiency and operational performance continues to grow at high pace,” making long-term projections for both expenditures and production challenging.

 Chevron's (CVX -1.9%) top priority is maintaining a dividend that’s “competitive and growing,” CFO Patricia Yarrington said in today's earnings conference call, but WSJ's Maxwell Murphy writes that the company needs a surge in cash flow to maintain its dividend and capital spending. In its Q1 earnings report, CVX said its operating cash flow was $2.3B - less than a quarter of its combined capex and dividend; the company's $33.9B debt now tops that of rival Exxon (NYSE:XOM) even though CVX has roughly half the annual revenue.
Yarrington said CVX will take a multi-pronged approach to generating enough cash, boosting cash flow through production growth while trimming its cost  structure and capex budget, and selling assets; she said CVX had disposed of $10B in assets over the  past 16 months, putting it well on track to achieve its $15B  four-year plan. |May 1, 2015, 3:15 PM|Exxon's outlook viewed differently by Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley

 Exxon Mobil (XOM +1.4%) is maintained with an Outperform rating at Wells Fargo following strong Q1 results, citing XOM's modest growth, strong balance sheet, industry leading access  to capital - important if attractive acquisition opportunities arise - and a decades-long commitment to shareholder returns.
The firm raises its FY 2015 EPS estimate to $4.48 from $3.62 based on the Q1 EPS beat, higher non-U.S. gas price realizations, and slightly lower  upstream operating expenditure, and believes shares should reach the $93-$97 range based on 18x its 2016 EPS forecast of $5.25.
Morgan Stanley analysts are underwhelmed, however, rating the stock at Underweight, believing XOM "will participate yet unlikely lead in a commodity recovery  we expect will unfold over the next 12 months and see upside potential  and yield support."
Coming down somewhere in between, J.P. Morgan sees XOM as mostly a defensive, dividend-oriented play and rates the stock as Neutral.

 Gasoline prices at the pump are up across the U.S. after a rebound in crude oil prices, but nowhere is the jump as severe as in California, where prices have surged by a third in the past week and by ~$1/gal in the past month.
The swift rise is because of problems at some refineries in the state: Last week, Chevron's (NYSE:CVX) Richmond refinery reported it was flaring,  and Tesoro (NYSE:TSO) indicated it was experiencing minor issues at its  Martinez refinery - The incidents trimmed output,  worried traders and sent wholesale prices shooting up.
California has been dealing with tight supply after a February  explosion at Exxon's (NYSE:XOM) Torrance refinery, and it  might take until July before operations there return to normal.
TSO also is undergoing unplanned maintenance work to solve a problem  at its Los Angeles facility, and CVX has shut some units in El Segundo for  planned maintenance work.
Refinery events are seen and treated as trade secrets, so any action by oil companies can cause a pop in the market, oil analyst Tom Kloza says: "There's a few big companies that if all of a sudden they're seen buying  aggressively in the market, it's going to prompt speculations like,  ‘Oh, they're having problems.'" |Apr. 30, 2015, 3:25 PM|Oil production starts from Kizomba Satellites phase 2 offshore Angola

 Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) +1.3% premarket after reporting a  smaller than expected drop in Q1 earnings,  as  production and refining results rose even as lower crude   prices ate into earnings. Q1 earnings from XOM's downstream refining and marketing business more than doubled to $1.7B, up $854M in the year-ago period, benefiting from cheaper crude and  by its international operations. However, Q1 earnings in the upstream E&P business fell 63% Y/Y to $2.86B even as production increased 2.3% to 4.2M boe/day, benefiting from new developments in Papua New Guinea, Canada, Angola, Indonesia, and U.S. onshore liquids plays; earnings in the chemical segment slipped 6.2% to $982M. Q1 total costs fell to $61B from $91B in the year-ago quarter; capital spending totaled $7.7B, down 9% Y/Y. XOM also says it expects to buy back $1B in shares in Q2, in line with the reduced level it targeted for Q1. "It was a strong quarter," said Edward Jones analyst Brian Youngberg, adding that XOM's diversified model tends to  hold up better  in a weaker oil market. |Apr. 30, 2015, 8:05 AM|Exxon Mobil beats by $0.35, beats on revenue

 The Dutch parliament votes to reverse the burden of proof in disputes over damages to buildings caused by gas production at the Groningen field. Under the motion approved by the Dutch parliament, the company that operates the Groningen field - a joint venture including Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and the government - would have to provide evidence that disputed damage claims are bogus, rather than claimants having to show evidence they are legitimate. The decision could be an expensive one: An recent estimate commissioned by the province of Groningen estimated as many as 212K buildings may have been damaged by earthquakes caused by gas production, with costs of compensation and strengthening buildings running as high as €30B over the next 30 years.
|Apr. 28, 2015, 3:28 PM|Refining helps BP, Total show resilience amid lower oil prices

 BP (BP +1%) and Total (TOT +2.3%) can thank much of their higher than expected profits in the latest quarter to steep increases in profits from refining, as the big slump in oil prices has meant refineries can process much cheaper crude and generate higher profits on fuels such as diesel or gasoline. As a result, BP's underlying pre-tax replacement cost profit from downstream businesses in Q1 more than doubled to $2.2B, while pre-tax profits from oil and gas production, or upstream, collapsed to $600M from $4.4B a year ago. At TOT, Q1's adjusted net operating income from refining and chemicals more than tripled Y/Y to $1.1B, almost matching contributions from upstream of $1.36B, which fell 56%. Global majors with high downstream exposure such as Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) and Exxon (NYSE:XOM) should benefit from the strong refining environment, which BP expects to last into Q2, according to Edison Investment Research. Despite the plunge in upstream earnings, analysts noted that both BP and TOT enjoyed strong increases in production after years of unimpressive growth, meaning earnings should recover quickly as soon as oil prices rise. |Apr. 27, 2015, 9:56 AM|Statoil must move ahead with Snorre field expansion, Norway minister says

 Statoil (STO +1.3%) must move ahead with the delayed expansion of the Snorre oil and gas field in the North Sea because it is a time-critical investment, Norway's energy minister says. STO last month delayed a decision on the $4B Snorre upgrade, which could yield an additional 300M barrels of oil, saying margins on the project were too low, particularly after the recent drop in crude prices; STO expects to decide in late 2016 whether to move ahead with building a new platform and extending the field's lifetime to 2040.

Texas regulators have ordered Exxon Mobil's (NYSE:XOM) XTO Energy subsidiary and another company to prove their wells near Fort Worth are not causing earthquakes. On Friday the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the state’s oil and gas industry, told both companies they need to appear at hearings scheduled for June to justify why their wells should not be shut down. The action follows a Southern Methodist University study released this week that linked a rash of small earthquakes in the area to nearby natural gas wells and the injection of wastewater deep underground. Also this week, the U.S. Geological Survey reported that an increase in seismic activity in Texas, Oklahoma and six other states "very likely" was caused by  wastewater injection from oil and gas operations.

 Exxon Mobil (XOM +0.6%) agrees to pay more than $5M as part of a settlement for the 2013 rupture of a pipeline in  Arkansas that was carrying oil sands from Canada. XOM’s Pegasus pipeline failed in March 2013, spewing 134K gallons of oil in a suburban housing development near Mayflower, Ark. XOM will pay $3.19M in federal civil penalties and must comply with a series of government requirements, including placing spill-response equipment in three places along the pipeline route before it can reopen; XOM also must pay state and local fines of $1.88M. |Apr. 21, 2015, 6:24 PM|BP's Dudley does not foresee wave of energy mergers, at least not yet

 
BP CEO Bob Dudley says he does not expect a wave of mergers in the energy industry unless oil prices stay low for long, downplaying talk that Shell's takeover of BG Group could trigger a wave of multibillion-dollar deals like those that reshaped the industry in the 1990s. It probably will take “quite a bit of time to work off” the high levels  of U.S. crude inventories at Cushing, Okla., and other oil hubs, Dudley told the IHS CERAWeek energy conference, adding that if sanctions against Iran were lifted, it would not take long to add 500K bbl/day of oil to the global market. Dudley’s remarks could suggest that Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), which has been speculated to be considering a move, would have difficulty persuading the BP board to accept an agreed offer; BP today denied a Bloomberg report that it had stepped up internal reviews of takeover scenarios following the Shell-BG deal.

 Exxon Mobil's (XOM -0.4%) Rex Tillerson predicts oil prices will remain low over the next few years, but says the energy industry is at a “turning point” and will show its  resiliency in the current down cycle. The CEO says in the keynote address at the IHS Energy CERAWeek conference in Houston that the oil industry could behave the same way U.S. shale gas did, when a significant decline in rig activity in prior years did not result in a drop in production capacity, thanks in part to improvements in efficiency. Government regulators need to give oil companies the freedom to innovate to enable “safer, more secure and more efficient  production,” Tillerson says, citing government oversight of fracking, a technique he says has proven effective and  safe in the most delicate ecosystems.
Tillerson says the government should open up the U.S. Arctic to oil production,  approve infrastructure projects such as the Keystone XL  pipeline, and lift the decades-old ban on crude oil exports  from the U.S.; the CEO says such policies would lead to more investment, which in turn would lead to more advanced technology.

BP execs reportedly are concerned the company is vulnerable to a takeover bid, and they are said to have stepped up internal reviews of takeover scenarios and war-gamed defense strategies with advisers from firms including Morgan Stanley. While a move for BP may seem unlikely because of still-unknown legal liabilities from the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, there’s at least one good reason for  BP's paranoia: Before ruling it out by going for BG, Royal Dutch Shell was said to have taken a hard look at buying BP.
Even a slimmed-down BP still has plenty to attract potential acquirers,  including strong deepwater prospects in Angola and the Gulf of Mexico, a  refining business that has outperformed peers, and an industry-leading  trading outfit. BP views Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) as the only realistic predators remaining, according to the report. |Apr. 20, 2015, 8:58 AM|Abu Dhabi says still in talks with companies on oil concessions

Total (NYSE:TOT) is the only company to be awarded a stake in Abu Dhabi National Oil's new venture so far, agreeing in February to pay a $2.2B signing bonus for a 10% share in the onshore concession. TOT, along with BP, Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) and Exxon (NYSE:XOM) were all partners in a previous concession that operated the same  onshore fields in Abu Dhabi for 75 years until it expired in January 2014; XOM balked at the new terms and decided not to seek to renew its concession.

 Nearly 60 institutional investors ask the SEC to require oil and gas companies to publish a detail analysis of the risks of climate change to their business models, much in the way companies already disclose information on factors outside their control such as commodity and currency price swings. Some oil companies already provide general information about how much they could lose if climate change worsens and regulation or cultural shifts reduce consumption, but the new request seeks more details about how they reached their conclusions. Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) said last year climate change poses little risk to its reserves but agreed to start providing some information about how it arrived at such a conclusion. The action comes the day after Calpers sponsored a successful shareholder resolution at BP's annual meeting that requires the company to begin stress-testing its operations against climate change risks. |Apr. 17, 2015, 2:29 PM|Reuters: Anadarko considers selling Mozambique gas assets to Exxon

 Anadarko Petroleum (APC -1.4%) is considering selling its multi-billion dollar stake in Mozambique's gas reserves, with Exxon Mobil (XOM -1.5%) and Qatar Petroleum showing interest, Reuters reports. APC reportedly could sell up to its full 26.5% stake in Mozambique's offshore Area 1 license in the Rovuma Basin; Area 1 holds more than 75T cf of recoverable gas, enough to meet at least four years of total European gas demand. The last Area 1 sale - a 10% stake that went for $2.64B in 2013 to India's ONGC - was seen as overpriced, and oil and gas prices have since plunged, making it difficult to value APC's asset.

 Papua New Guinea's state oil company says it is looking to raise billions of dollars to help fund new oil and gas projects, as the country battles a drop in forecast revenue from plunging prices for energy commodities. The company holds a 16.6% stake in the PNG LNG project, which operator Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) hopes to expand, and has rights to take up to a 20% stake in the Elk-Antelope fields, Papua's largest undeveloped gas resource and operated by Total (NYSE:TOT). Funding an expansion of PNG LNG and any Elk-Antelope development would require the state-run firm to contribute billions of dollars in the next three years, so it makes sense for it to raise debt well before it needs the money. Papua New Guinea's economy grew by 8.4% last year, making it one of the fastest growing in the world, and the energy projects are seen as vital to the economy.

 The Dutch government says it will implement a court order to halt production at part of the Groningen gas field - Europe's largest - amid local protests over earthquakes allegedly linked to extraction work. Production will be halted "for the time being" around the village of Loppersum in the northern province of Groningen, where the field is located, but the court ruling stopped short of imposing a full block on production in the gas field that complainants had sought. Loppersum production previously was capped at 3B cm for 2015, representing ~9% of overall output from Groningen, which is jointly managed by Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and the Dutch government.

 Canadian Oil Sands (OTCQX:COSWF +5.5%), the company with the largest stake in oil sands miner Syncrude Canada, is a  prime takeover target and its most likely suitor is Imperial Oil (IMO +1.9%), the company with the second-largest stake, says FirstEnergy Capital analyst Michael Dunn. The analyst says his report is partly based on recent investor meetings with senior IMO execs who believe now is a good time to consider making acquisitions. Dunn thinks IMO would not want to pay more than a price in the low teens for COSWF, so its stock would have  to fall further to make a bid attractive, and he suggests the company would not want to take on excessive debt - which could mean an  equity-based offer, help from its controlling shareholder, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), or enrolling a current Syncrude partner such as Suncor (NYSE:SU). |Apr. 10, 2015, 6:27 PM|Exxon could be next in line for oil mega-deal, Morgan Stanley says

 Add Morgan Stanley to those speculating that Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) could be the next oil major to pull off a big company takeover comparable to Shell’s $70B bid for BG Group. XOM is trading at a premium to large independent producers, has a healthier balance sheet than most, and has access to cheap debt - such as the $7B it raised earlier this year - adding to its strength a potential buyer, Stanley says. If it pursues a deal, XOM likely would seek a company with offshore operations rather than a U.S. shale producer, the firm says, adding that XOM seems to pursue a major deal every five years to a decade, so it could be due. Oppenheimer's Fadel Gheit is skeptical, saying that even though oil prices have fallen by more than half since June, oil stocks are not cheap: "Oil stocks are expensive. They’re reflecting $75/bbl. We might not see that for years.” Morgan Stanley agrees that price is an issue but "as the number of asset buyers exceeds sellers... we think the market is setting up for a chase.”

 Radon levels have been rising measurably in Pennsylvania since 2004, when the fracking industry began drilling natural gas wells in the state, according to a new report by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The report does not pinpoint the exact cause of rising radon readings or explicitly tie it to any activity, but it says that buildings in counties where natural gas is most actively being extracted have in the past decade had much higher radon measurements than buildings in low-activity areas, where no such discrepancies were found before 2004. Pennsylvania has long been known to have some of the highest indoor radon levels in the U.S., but the researchers say fracking of the Marcellus shale formation could exacerbate pathways for radon to enter buildings.

 Analysts say Shell's (RDS.A, RDS.B) move to buy BG Group is telling  potential acquirers that one of the biggest players is now confident enough to make a big play, and that the worst may be over in the big slide in oil and gas prices. The deal also may be the starting gun for a wave of M&A activity that oil industry observers have been predicting since crude prices started to slump in June. For starters, BG's U.S. shale assets likely will become candidates for divestiture  after the Shell deal closes; in buying BG, Shell has made the choice to  double-down on global liquefied natural gas and de-emphasize U.S. shale. Among the biggest players, Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and BP could contemplate deals - perhaps even with each other, as has been speculated, since BP ranks among the cheapest major producers relative to estimated profit.
BG itself could whet the appetite of XOM's Rex Tillerson, who recently said there was "no limitation" to what he might buy - but he will be especially selective after getting burned by 2010's XTO purchase. Companies with prime acreage in  oil-rich shale fields in Texas, North Dakota and Colorado have become a lot cheaper in recent months; Anadarko (NYSE:APC), Cabot Oil & Gas (NYSE:COG), Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD), Occidental (NYSE:OXY), Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR), Concho Resources (NYSE:CXO) and Tullow Oil (OTCPK:TUWLF) are among those at topping analysts’ lists.

 Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) will become a dominant player in the liquefied natural gas market through its acquisition of BG Group, selling ~50M tons/year of LNG by the end of the decade vs. less than 25M tons/year by Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Shell CFO Simon Henry says. The deal will increase Shell’s LNG sales by 32% immediately and 80% by 2018, accounting for ~15% of the world’s traded LNG, according to Henry. The deal gives Shell access to BG’s Australian project to produce 8.5M tons/year of LNG from coal-seam gas; the first unit at the site already is producing and a second will start later this year, BG Chairman Andrew Gould says. The acquisition also gives Shell assets in Tanzania, where some of the world’s biggest gas discoveries have been made; BG has a 60% interest in three offshore blocks and may help develop an LNG plant there to export gas to Asia and Europe. In the LNG market “size really matters and the size underlines delivery potential,” Shell CEO Ben Van Beurden says. "This is about scale.”

The cleanup costs are at the center of a fierce debate between the  Christie administration and the Democrat-led legislature, which faults the settlement at a fraction of the $8.9B in damages that had been determined in court documents; the administration counters that there is no cap on the cost of cleaning up the site, which XOM must pay for.

 Analysts at Jefferies now expect Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) to surpass Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) as the world's largest publicly traded oil and gas producer by 2018, with output of 4.2M boe/day, following Shell's $69.6B deal to buy BG Group.
But XOM has long been rumored as a potential bidder for BG, and Financial Times points out that it now has both the motive and the opportunity, raising the possibility that it could try to outbid Shell for BG.
Like  Shell, XOM is struggling to grow and will find it easier to raise  production by dealmaking than by drilling; XOM’s output was ~4.3M boe/day in 2001 and 4M last year.
With  its greater size, low debt and AAA credit rating, XOM could muster a larger cash component in any offer than Shell’s 28% of its total offer of ₤13.50/share; however, hostile deals are very rare in the oil and gas industry.
Whether or not  BG is the perfect fit for XOM, Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research has suggested other midsized E&P specialists could prove tempting, including  Hess (NYSE:HES), Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR), Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN), Apache (NYSE:APA) and Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC).

The Groningen field is operated by state-owned Gasunie and output jointly exploited by the government and a joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM).

 Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is said to be escalating plans for a multi-billion dollar expansion of its 344K bbl/day Beaumont oil refinery that could make it the largest U.S. plant and fourth largest in the world. XOM reportedly has filed for four Texas permits requesting state approval to increase emissions and install new equipment at the refinery. Reports last year had indicated XOM was considering doubling the current capacity by 2020, but now it may go as high as 850K bbl/day by the end of the decade. If the Beaumont refinery becomes the country's largest, XOM would have three of the top five refineries by capacity in the U.S., with its Baytown, Tex., plant currently ranking second and its Baton Rouge, La., complex fourth. |Mar. 31, 2015, 2:57 PM|FT: Oil majors over a barrel due to falling reserves


A Financial Times analysis of the latest annual reports for the big five global oil majors - BP, Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) and Total (NYSE:TOT) - show that proved reserves for the group as a whole shrank by more than a billion barrels to 78.6B boe in 2014 from 80B-plus boe the previous year in the steepest drop since at least 2008.
The five companies’ organic reserve replacement ratio was 84% last year, the lowest level since 2010, with only CVX reporting a Y/Y increase in extensions and discoveries.
Behind the fall is a substantial decline in the number of barrels added as a result of recent discoveries and extensions to existing oil and gas fields, which fell 24% last year to 2.3B boe and has been cut nearly in half from 4.4B boe in 2011.
The deteriorating exploration performance, if sustained, would raise further questions over the companies' ability to grow in the long run without making acquisitions.

 Exxon Mobil (XOM +2.4%) says it began production at its Hadrian South gas development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico with facilities tied back to the nearby Lucius project, reducing additional infrastructure requirements. XOM expects daily gross production from Hadrian South, its deepest subsea  tie-back in nearly a mile and a half of water, to reach  ~300M cf of gas and 3K barrels of liquids  from two wells.
Hadrian South is a subsea production system with flowlines connected to       the Anadarko-operated Lucius truss spar, which started production in       January.
With the startup of Hadrian South and Lucius, XOM's       total Gulf of Mexico net production capacity has increased by more than       45K boe/day.
XOM holds a 46.7%       interest in Hadrian South, with partners Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) at 23.3% and Eni (NYSE:E) holding a 30% stake; XOM owns a 23.3% interest in Lucius. |Mar. 27, 2015, 6:05 PM|Russia reportedly preparing for Exxon arbitration claim


Russia is preparing for the possibility that Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) will file an arbitration claim over as much as $500M in taxes as a statute of limitation for part of a disputed payment at its offshore project expires this week, Bloomberg reports.
XOM is believed to be seeking a reduced profit tax for the 30%-owned Sakhalin-1 oil venture it operates in Russia Far East, and wants to get back tax it paid above the reduced rate for the past seven years.
XOM CEO Rex Tillerson, who expanded drilling rights in Russia fivefold in 2014, traveled to Moscow last week but is said to have left without a deal on the tax dispute.
The statute of limitation over payments for 2008, the first year in dispute, apparently expires March 28; XOM probably would demand taxes for seven years, not just 2008, if it files a claim.

The number of drill rigs in North Dakota’s oil patch has slipped  below 100 for the first time in five years thanks to weaker crude oil prices.
Only 98 rigs are now drilling in the area, 100  fewer than on the same day a year ago and the lowest since March  2010.
North Dakota has been producing ~1.2M bbl/day of oil, and industry officials say ~115 rigs need to be drilling to keep that level of production.

 Investors largely take in stride Freeport McMoRan's (FCX -0.7%) 84% dividend cut, apparently agreeing with analysts at Jefferies who say the cut was “sensible” because it saves the company $1.1B/year of cash. FCX "is not entirely out of the woods yet as macro risks clearly remain, but this dividend reduction is a step in the right direction and could indicate a bottom in Freeport shares," says the firm's Christopher LaFemina. The dividend was so high that investors probably knew that paying out $1.25/year might be hard to continue, but an 84% cut - particularly with the recent bounce in copper prices - is a message that FCX is "worried about more than just the next few earnings reports," 24/7's Jon Ogg writes. Dividend cuts are rare in the energy and materials sector, points out S&P's Howard Silverblatt, who wonders what Exxon Mobil (XOM -0.9%) will do next month when it reports earnings; after increasing its dividend for 32 straight years, Silverblatt says the more pertinent question is not if, but by how much. |Mar. 20, 2015, 10:33 AM|Bakken production may surge this summer, North Dakota official says

 No matter how unfavorable market fundamentals may be to Bakken operators, North Dakota likely will see a big surge in production this June, potentially besting another supply record even if prices  continue to crater, according to the director of the state's Department of Mineral Resources.
Production is expected to remain at 1.1M-1.2M bbl/day over the next few months before skyrocketing in June by nearly 10%, or an additional 75K-100K bbl/day, propelled by a state-mandated  time limit on drilling and the expected trigger of a major oil tax  incentive.

 Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is asking the Russian government to return several billion rubles in taxes it says it overpaid on the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project in Russia's far east in which it has a 30% stake. The Kommersant newspaper reported that XOM believes it overpaid profit taxes, as it continued to pay a 35% rate after Russia reduced its profit tax in 2009 to 20%; XOM is said to have overpaid by 10B rubles ($163.7M) in 2014 alone.

|Mar. 17, 2015, 7:40 PM|EIA: Oil production falling at Eagle Ford, Bakken, Niobrara shale plays


Crude oil production at three major U.S. shale oil fields - the Eagle Ford in south Texas, the Bakken in North Dakota, and the  Niobrara in Colorado and adjacent states - is projected to  fall this month for the first time in six years, the Energy  Information Administration says.
Net production from the three fields is expected to drop by a combined 24K bbl/day, but overall losses likely will be masked by production gains in the Permian Basin in west Texas and other regions.
It is one of the first signs that idling hundreds of drilling rigs and  billions of dollars in corporate cutbacks are starting to affect the U.S. oil patch, but it also shows that drilling technology and techniques have advanced  to the point that productivity gains may be negligible in some shale  plays.

|Mar. 17, 2015, 7:12 PM|Analysis: ConocoPhillips may withstand oil price disruption better than most

 Most of the top 15 shale oil producers in the U.S. are heavily concentrated in basins expected by NavPort to be severely affected by the decline in prices, with one major exception: ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP).
COP has the lowest well completion concentration in basins expected to suffer the greatest production cuts this year, implying less disruption than other shale competitors, according to NavPort, which collates oil well and rig data using regulatory reports.
All 14 of the other top producers tracked by NavPort have at least two-thirds of well completion concentrated in the basins rated with "strong" or "severe" exposure: CHK, APC, EOG, DVN, SWN, MRO, APA, SD, XOM, CLR, PXD, NBL, BHP, WLL.
Operators concentrated in basins that have been less severely  affected - such as the Woodford, Utica and Haynesville basins - should enjoy more production than their peers through a  higher volume of well completions, NavPort says.
The study sees the Mississippi Lime, Granite Wash, Bakken and Permian basins suffering at least a 40% Y/Y reduction in drilling. |Mar. 16, 2015, 6:45 PM|Report: Exxon CEO to visit Moscow this week amid talk of more sanctions

As prices for Bakken sweet crude fell to a six-year low of an average of $31.41/bbl in January, down from $40.74 December, the number of completions of previously drilled wells fell sharply to 47 from 183 in the prior month. The number of active rigs used to drill new wells in North Dakota sank to 111 as of today, the fewest since April 2010 and about half the peak of 218 rigs in May 2012; the state's mineral resources director predicts a bottom 100 rigs, noting that 115 active rigs are needed to maintain stable production.

The three biggest oil traders in the world are BP, Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) and Total (NYSE:TOT), and they make lots of money from oil crashes, according to a Bloomberg report.
The trio’s sway in commodities trading is set to pay off this year as the crude oil bear market allows traders to generate higher returns by storing cheap oil today to sell at higher prices later and using lower prices to make more bets with the same capital.
"Volatility has increased dramatically over the last three or four months,” says the head of Shell’s trading business. “Parts of the business that are volatility driven are probably doing pretty well.”
The European oil majors do not disclose full financial results from their trading desks, but in Q1 2009 during the last major bear market, BP said it made $500M above its normal level of profits from trading, meaning that trading accounted for at least 20% of BP’s adjusted income of $2.38B that quarter.
Oil trading could provide BP, Shell and Total with an edge over U.S. rivals Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX), which sell their own production but largely eschew pure trading as a means of generating profits.

 Authorities hope to reopen the Houston Ship Channel today after a tanker carrying  216K  barrels of gasoline additive MTBE  collided Monday with a bulk carrier hauling steel, prompting the shutdown of a five-mile stretch of the channel. Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) says it cut production rates at its 560K bbl/day refinery in Baytown, Tex. - the second-largest refinery in the U.S. - as crude deliveries continue to be delayed by wreckage that have partially closed the Houston Ship Channel.

 The widening corruption probe into Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) is likely to delay by at least one year four major offshore oilfield projects, Portuguese partner Galp Energia (OTC:GLPEF) says, in a first sign of strain on foreign investors. Galp, which is involved in nearly 30 onshore and offshore oil and gas projects in Brazil, eyes a one-year delay in the building of production ships for the Lula Sul, Lula Norte, Lula Extremo Sul and Lula Oeste fields, which it is developing with PBR. The uncertainty is expected to lead to delays in the delivery of four locally-made FPSO units after contractors have either gone bankrupt or been banned from receiving money from PBR due to the corruption scandal. Galp's forecast comes before PBR issues its own guidance on project development in light of the investigation. Other major oil companies producing in Brazil include XOM, RDS.A, RDS.B, STO, CVX, BP, OTCQX:REPYY, OTCPK:REPYF, OTCPK:BRGXF, OTCQX:BRGYY. |Mar. 11, 2015, 11:59 AM|Still not time to buy Exxon or other big energy stocks, analyst says

Whiting Petroleum's (NYSE:WLL) decision to put itself up for sale looks to be just the beginning of a potential wave of consolidation as $50/bbl prices undercut companies with heavy debt and high costs.
The value of ~75 shale-focused U.S. producers based on their reserves fell by a median of 25% Y/Y by the end of 2014, according to Bloomberg, opening up new opportunities for bigger companies with a better handle on their debt.
Smaller producers with significant debt that depend on higher prices to make money are the most likely early targets for buyers such as Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) or Chevron (NYSE:CVX), companies that have bided their time for years; XOM CEO Rex Tillerson suggested last week that his company is keeping its eyes open for opportunities.
A recent analysis by Wolfe Research found the likeliest takeover candidates among major U.S. and Canadian producers included Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR), Apache (NYSE:APA), Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) and Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC).
WLL would be an attractive target for XOM, CVX or Hess (NYSE:HES), all of which have operations in North Dakota and would benefit from scaling up, according to a Bank of America note.

 Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) are likely to withstand the oil price collapse better than their rivals because they are closer to finishing expensive investment projects, according to a Reuters analysis. Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Total (NYSE:TOT), on the other hand, are both in the midst of large project spending cycles and will need to tap into more debt in order to stay afloat. While all companies are expected to keep paying high dividends by increasing borrowing, Exxon and Shell appear to be most able to cover both spending and dividend payouts if oil prices stay at current prices, and are likely to be able to pick up bargain assets while the price collapse shakes out the sector. Exxon and Shell also are ahead in terms of where their cash flow breaks even: According to analysts at Jefferies, both have 2015 breakevens of $75-$80/bbl, healthier than Chevron, BP and Eni's (NYSE:E) respective breakevens of $95, $100 and $120.

 Analysts are mostly positive on Whiting Petroleum (WLL +10.8%) after WSJ's report that the company is looking to sell itself, particularly seeking out Statoil (STO -1.7%) to make a bid. WLL is a prime takeover candidate, given its attempt to sell itself in 2012, BofA Merrill says as it maintains its Buy rating and $45 price target, adding that the scale of WLL's assets has increased  significantly because of its Kodiak acquisition and could attract large energy companies with strong balance sheets such as Exxon (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Hess (NYSE:HES). WLL could get a strong price because of its rich assets in the Bakken Shale; on the other hand, investors have become particularly concerned about E&P companies that are heavily focused on a single region, as WLL is in the Bakken. UBS analyst Betty Jiang points out some hurdles to a potential deal, including a wide price differential between buyers and sellers, and potential acquirers' apparent preference for buying land in areas that are cheaper than the Bakken. |Mar. 9, 2015, 2:24 PM|Goldman Sachs is bullish Exxon, less so on Chevron, ConocoPhillips

 Goldman Sachs says it has been too bearish on crude oil and also on Exxon Mobil (XOM -0.3%), issuing a Buy recommendation with a $97 price target on the stock and saying XOM is the only oil super major that will generate positive free cash flow in 2016 and  will have the cash the make acquisitions going forward. Goldman argues the industry is moving into a new phase in the investment cycle, from capital expenditures to project launches, and that XOM is most likely to have positive free cash flow; the firm sees several projects coming into service in 2015-16 - including Kearl, Cold Lake, Upper Zakum 750 and Banyu Urip, driving lower capex - and thus expects XOM to maintain the lowest free cash flow breakeven point after its dividend among the oil majors at only $61/bbl in 2016 vs. 2012-14 average levels of $99/bbl.
Goldman also sees XOM raising its dividend by 6% each year on  average through 2017 and buy back ~$1B worth of shares  each quarter. The firm is less enamored with Chevron (CVX +0.9%) and ConocoPhillips (COP -0.7%), offering only Neutral outlooks on those shares; CVX needs Brent crude to trade at ~$84/bbl this year to cover its  dividend before any asset sales, the highest among U.S. super  majors, Goldman says. |Mar. 5, 2015, 5:54 PM|Exxon to begin drilling offshore Guyana

 New Jersey officially announces a $225M settlement with Exxon Mobil (XOM -0.3%) that state officials say is the largest environmental settlement in state history, but it is criticized for totaling a mere fraction of the nearly $9B initially sought. The state AG's office says the settlement over  refinery sites in Linden and Bayonne is separate from XOM's  obligation to clean up the sites at its own expense. A NYT story yesterday suggested that the state's 11-year battle for damages resulted in the settlement only when Gov. Christie's chief counsel became involved. The decision to settle for "roughly three cents on the dollar" after years of litigation is an "embarrassment," writes Bradley Campbell, commissioner of the state's Department of Environmental Protection when the case was filed in 2004. Legislators and environmentalists are calling for investigations and rejection of the deal. |Mar. 5, 2015, 11:28 AM|Exxon's Tillerson on M&A: "No limitation on what we might be interested in"

 Exxon Mobil (XOM -0.5%), with $17.9B in free cash flow to end 2014, is under much less pressure to cut spending than smaller rivals, which are coming under varying degrees of financial strain amid lower oil prices; 2015 capex is being cut by 12%, a striking display of stability when compared to 30%-40% capex cuts generally announced by small and midsized E&P companies. CEO Rex Tillerson says being able to keep spending at rates that others can't provides XOM "a whole lot of different kinds of opportunities” in two main areas: cutting costs and acquiring assets.
On acquisitions, Tillerson’s comment that “there really is no limitation on what we might be interested in or considering" in terms of possible deals suggests he is prepared to be ambitious.
While a rumored bid for BP is not impossible, most analysts are doubtful due to the political sensitivities of such a deal and uncertainty about liabilities from the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill; Wolfe Research's Paul Sankey thinks XOM is most interested in a U.S.-focused midsized oil company, with “key potential targets” including HES, CLR, DVN, APA and APC. |Mar. 4, 2015, 6:08 PM|Venezuela must pay full interest on Exxon arbitration award, court rules

 "People kinda need to settle in for a while,” CEO Rex Tillerson said at Exxon Mobil’s (XOM -0.5%) annual investor conference in New York today, expecting crude oil prices to remain low for at least the next two years because of ample global supplies and relatively weak economic growth.
"There’s a lot of supply out there, and I don’t see a particularly healthy economy," the CEO says. In outlining its business plans through 2017, XOM assumes a price of $55/bbl, $5 below where Brent crude is trading today and about half of what Brent averaged between 2011 and the middle of last year. Tillerson says XOM projects that will add production through 2017 are basically fully funded, but beyond that some investment decisions may be delayed if low prices persist. XOM says the startup of Hadrian South in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the expansion of the Kearl oil sands project in Canada and deepwater expansion projects in Nigeria and Angola will add to production this year. XOM also aims to squeeze out more oil and gas while keeping its budget in check, and the CEO says one way it will do this is by negotiating better terms for itself, telling analysts that it expects lower contractor fees from oil services firms.

 Kinder Morgan (KMI -0.6%) wants to drill through Burnaby Mountain in British Columbia to reach an oil-loading ship terminal, but WSJ reports that it is facing more challenges than the mountain itself, as it also is battling resistance from Vancouver officials and protestors opposed to fossil fuel development.
Burnaby Mountain has become a symbolic battlefield in a much larger  debate about energy resources in North America, opponents and supporters  of the pipeline plan say. Canadian oil producers are counting on KMI’s $4.3B proposal to triple the capacity of the existing Trans Mountain pipeline, which connects Alberta’s oil sands to a Pacific coast terminal, as the fate of the Keystone XL pipeline remains in limbo. More than a dozen oil companies have binding deals for up to 20 years with the pipeline, including Exxon (NYSE:XOM) affiliate Imperial Oil (NYSEMKT:IMO),                                     Cenovus Energy            (NYSE:CVE)                and                                     Canadian Natural Resources (NYSE:CNQ), who view the project as a vital link to new markets in Asia. |Mar. 4, 2015, 9:14 AM|Exxon's analyst day: Sees 2015 capex falling 11% but production rising 2%

The bet on Russia follows a string of drilling failures elsewhere and spending cuts that will likely be addressed in CEO Rex Tillerson’s investor meeting tomorrow.
Worldwide, XOM’s exploration failure rate worsened last year to 39% from 33% in 2013, and had dry holes in two-thirds of the regions in which it operates; also, its costs to extract a barrel of crude from the ground rose 9.3% to a global average of $12.55. |Mar. 3, 2015, 11:38 AM|Exxon said to plan $7B bond sale in its biggest-ever deal

 Exxon Mobil (XOM -0.9%) plans to sell as much as $7B of bonds in what would be its largest ever debt deal and the biggest energy-related offering since the plunge in crude prices, Bloomberg reports. XOM may issue the securities in as many as eight parts, with the longest maturity portion in 30-year notes that are expected to yield ~90 bps more than comparable Treasury notes, according to the report.
XOM last issued bonds a year ago, when it sold $5.5B in its biggest offering to date and its first deal since 1993. |Mar. 3, 2015, 10:28 AM|Exxon needs $85 oil to cover capex and dividend, Oppenheimer says

 Exxon Mobil (XOM -0.8%) needs oil at $85/bbl to cover its capex and dividend, Oppenheimer says in a new research note, but Deutsche Bank believes XOM's cash flow issues are not as bad as feared. Oppenheimer expects XOM to generate earnings of $14.7B this year and $19.3B next year, with operating cash flow of $34.3B and $39.7B; based on capital spending of $34B and $11.5B annual cash dividend, the firm sees XOM facing free cash flow shortfalls, before share buybacks, of $9B-plus this year and next, to be funded from additional  borrowing and proceeds from asset sales.
However, Deutsche Bank believes cash flow fears at XOM and Cheveron (NYSE:CVX) are overstated, seeing the significant roll-off in project spending and U.S. onshore flexibility driving significant medium-term capex deflation with limited  near-term portfolio impact.

 Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and partners win the support of Western Australia state's environmental regulator for a plan to expand capacity at the giant Gorgon liquefied natural gas export project by a third to 20M tons/year by eventually building a fourth processing unit. The expansion plan, which also needs approval by state and federal environment ministers, does not guarantee construction will go ahead, as developers of Australian energy projects have been scaling back or deferring plans following the plunge in world energy prices. But construction of Gorgon's $54B first stage is more than 90% complete and the venture, which also counts Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) as significant shareholders, is due to ship its first LNG cargo later this year. |Mar. 2, 2015, 7:35 PM|WSJ: Crude on derailed train would have violated new vapor-pressure cap

 The crude oil aboard the train that derailed and exploded two weeks ago in West Virginia contained so much combustible gas that it would have been barred from rail transport under safety regulations set to go into effect next month, WSJ reports. The oil’s vapor pressure was 13.9 psi, which exceeds the limit of 13.7 psi that North Dakota is set to impose in April on oil moving by truck or rail from the Bakken Shale. Plains All American Pipeline (NYSE:PAA), which shipped the oil, says it follows regulations governing the shipping and testing of crude; CSX, the railroad that carried the oil, says it had stepped up its inspections of the track along the route. The new information about the West Virginia accident likely will increase regulators’ focus on the makeup of oil being shipped by train; oil from sahle formations is known to contain far more combustible gas than traditional crude oil, which has a vapor pressure of ~6 psi.

 The Dutch government  apologizes for ignoring risks posed by  earthquakes  caused by production of natural gas from the Groningen field, following a report last month by the country's safety board that found the government, together  with Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), had put  profits  before safety in exploiting the field. The economic minister has ordered production at Gronignen to be cut by 16% for H1 2015, with another  decision on production at the field expected on July 1. The Groningen field accounts for two-thirds of Dutch gas production, and the Netherlands supplies ~15% of Europe's total natural gas, providing an important alternative for Russian gas.

 Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) has been a strong relative performer since the oil price swoon, but Jefferies analysts see Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) as better investor options right now. Jefferies does not expect XOM's March 4 analyst day will offer reasons to own the stock, and if capex guidance exceeds expectations and the share buyback program is eliminated, it could make the market question XOM's defensive qualities. The firm prefers CVX over an 18-month period due to its superior growth, although it suggests holding off until after the company's March 10 analyst meeting; CVX trades at a 29% EV/DACF discount to XOM on its 2016 estimates. Jefferies likes Shell as a defensive stock within the sector, saying its cash cycle and balance sheet are just as strong as XOM and it trades at a 42% EV/DACF discount vs. XOM on its 2016 estimates. |Feb. 27, 2015, 2:15 PM|NYT: Exxon settles $9B New Jersey environmental case for $250M

 Exxon Mobil (XOM +0.4%) reaches a settlement with the state of New Jersey, agreeing to pay $250M in damages for the contamination of wetlands caused by two refineries, NYT reports. Lawsuits were first filed in 2004 by New Jersey's environmental protection agency and finally made their way to trial last year; the state had been seeking $2.6B for the primary  restoration of the  wetlands sites and an additional $6.3B for compensatory damages. The parties have not announced the deal publicly, and it still must be approved by the judge, but followers of the case did not know why New Jersey would suddenly settle a case that it had fought strenuously for more than a decade. |Feb. 26, 2015, 4:57 PM|Exxon says spending to fall 11% to $34B

 North Dakota's oil producers have cut the number of active rigs in the state to just 121 from 190 a year ago, according to a new list published by the state’s Department of Mineral Resources. The rig count is now below the threshold of “at least 130” the DMR director had identified last month as needed to sustain output at the current level of slightly more than 1.2M bbl/day. Of the 121 active rigs, 115 are  drilling in just four counties at the heart of the Bakken - Dunn,  McKenzie, Mountrail and Williams. With the number of rigs in even the core areas  down by 30% in just over two months, production likely will begin to plateau or fall in the coming months, Reuters' John Kemp writes.

Refinery profit margins on the U.S. west coast have spiked over the past  week, as a refinery explosion and a spreading strike by refinery  workers has taken almost 25% of the region's gasoline-making capacity  offline, Platts reports.
Cracking margin netbacks for west coast refiners reached $31.75/bbl on Monday, up from $18.96/bbl prior to last  Wednesday's explosion at Exxon Mobil's (NYSE:XOM) 149.5K bbl/day refinery in Torrance.
Meanwhile, the strike by U.S. refinery workers that began Feb. 1 also weighs on west coast operations, with Tesoro's (NYSE:TSO) 166K bbl/day Golden  Eagle refinery in Martinez, Calif., idled.

Liquid additions during 2014 totaled more than 1.2B bbl, or 162%  of production, and natural gas additions totaled ~300M boe for a 42% replacement ratio.
At year-end 2014, proved reserves of 25.3B boe comprised of 54% liquids and 46% natural gas. XOM says it added more than 580M boe from U.S. oil-rich shales including the fast-growing Woodford, Permian, and Bakken; ~700M boe came from Canada.

 Warren Buffett's decision to dump his entire $4B stake in Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is pointing investors toward more nimble producers such as Suncor (NYSE:SU) and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) that can deliver higher returns during an oil price recovery. J.P. Morgan is reiterating its lukewarm outlook on XOM, "which has not yet fully pulled the trigger to just run at maintenance type levels," as well as ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Cenovus Energy (NYSE:CVE), which the firm says are "getting quite close to their sustaining capex/free cash flow potential already."

The agency says the shutdown of the unit could last up to six months, which pushed up spot prices for California gasoline today by nearly $0.12 to $2.01; oil analyst Tom Kloza thinks local retail gas prices in the area could rise to as  much as $3.25/gallon by April from a recent average in California of ~$2.80.

WSJ’s report that China’s government is considering merging some of its big oil companies has caught the attention of Asia’s energy analysts, but Jefferies analysts doubt that the leadership actually will pull the trigger, saying the merger talk is "more brainstorming and thinking outside the box rather than feasible proposals.” The firm notes that CNPC (NYSE:PTR) already is plenty big enough to compete with Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM): It is bigger than XOM on an asset basis, production at the group level exceeded XOM in 2013, and the value of CNPC's proved reserves at year-end 2013 likely exceeded XOM's by ~50%. Jefferies also notes that Sinopec’s (NYSE:SNP) production and value of in-ground reserves exceeds that of ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP). A merger between Cnooc (NYSE:CEO) and SinoChem could make sense, as it would create a fully integrated, 1M bbl/day company spanning upstream and downstream operations. 
WSJ's Liam Denning writes that any such merger would be a step backward because smaller companies offer a better chance for growth, and supermajors such as XOM and COP mostly have struggled to increase their production.

 Exxon (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Conoco (NYSE:COP) and Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) have held steady even as the price of crude has fallen from $80/bbl to $50, which suggests  little upside for the shares if oil turns up and big trouble if it doesn't, according to a weekend feature in Barron's. XOM and its peers are struggling to grow production, incurring heavy capital expenditures, dealing with increasingly difficult host governments, and facing a world in which energy demand is growing at  about half the rate of global GDP; despite $38B in  capital spending last year, XOM’s energy production fell ~2% and is projected to be unchanged this year.
Energy stocks actually have outperformed the broader market so far this month as crude oil prices have bounced off lows, but many experts expect oil to resume its downward slide; Citigroup, for one, warns crude could dip as low as $20, which surely would spark another broad downturn for energy  stocks as companies are forced to shut down wells. That’s the main reason analysts are calling for energy  sector earnings to worsen in the coming quarters, which makes stocks that look cheap at first glance actually quite expensive and suggests they still  haven’t hit bottom. |Feb. 12, 2015, 3:27 PM|Reuters: Exxon wants five-year Beaumont pact to nix strikes during buildout

 Exxon Mobil's (XOM +1.9%) push for workers at its Beaumont, Tex., refinery to sign a five-year contract, nearly twice as long as the last one, is part of an effort to avert labor stoppages during a possible expansion that could make it the largest such plant in the U.S., according to Reuters. XOM is said to have offered a $4,500 bonus to hourly workers represented by the United Steelworkers union, which normally only signs three-year deals in the refining industry. Acceptance of the proposal would leave the USW  Beaumont local out of sync with the union’s current national bargaining program for refinery workers. As reported in July, before crude prices  plunged, XOM is evaluating a five-year, multibillion-dollar expansion to lift the refinery’s processing capacity to 500K-800K bbl/day from 344K now. |Feb. 12, 2015, 2:14 PM|Exxon-for-BP deal speculated in WSJ article

 If Exxon Mobil (XOM +1.6%) decides to go hunting for struggling energy peers with shrinking cash flow - as it did five years ago when it acquired XTO Resources for $25B, during an energy rout worse than today's - it would need to go big or not go at all in order to meaningfully boost its oil and gas reserves, WSJ writes as it discusses BP (BP +2.1%) as a potential takeover target. BP “is the obvious fit says Wolfe Research's Paul Sankey; buying BP, which is still dealing with the fallout of the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, “would close out a damaged brand at a terrific price” and bolster XOM’s capacity to find new sources of oil and gas, he says. Other potentially attractive targets singled out by analysts include a smaller tier of companies such as Anadarko (APC +1.9%) and BG Group (OTCPK:BRGXF, OTCQX:BRGYY), which have discovered huge deposits of oil and gas but may lack the cash flow to develop them quickly. |Feb. 12, 2015, 11:33 AM|Pennsylvania governor proposes new tax on nat gas extraction

Abu Dhabi's state-owned oil company is said to have demanded ~$8B combined from a number of companies hoping for part of a 40% equity stake in oil reserves to be jointly developed over the next 40 years; industry insiders consider the upfront payments one of the bigger ever for an oil concession.

Colombia wants to stop a decline in oil production by making its royalties system more favorable to large drillers, the head of the country’s planning department says.
A proposal in the government's new four-year development plan would give oil companies a major incentive to invest in increasing output at existing fields by treating the extra crude as though it were from a new discovery, making it eligible for lower levies.
Colombia’s crude output fell last year for the first time since 2005, while plunging oil prices has prompted Ecopetrol (NYSE:EC) and Pacific Rubiales (OTCPK:PEGFF) to cut investment.

 Big oil companies had a poor record of finding and producing oil and gas last year, Reuters reports as it cites figures out in the past week, and big cuts in spending in response to falling crude prices could undermine their plans to turn that around. Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and BP released provisional figures showing together they replaced only two-thirds of the hydrocarbons they extracted in 2014  with new reserves; combined with Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), they posted an average drop in oil and gas production of 3.25% in 2014. The 2014 results echo long-term trends: Over the past decade, the biggest Western oil majors have seen reserves growth stall, production drop 15% and profits fall by nearly 20%. Some analysts warn that overly aggressive cuts could have long-term repercussions; the expertise needed to develop new fields and infrastructure takes long periods to build up, thus if companies lose this expertise, they may struggle to expand their portfolios when oil prices recover.

 Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) +0.6% premarket as unadjusted Q4 earnings fell 21% Y/Y due to lower commodity prices in the upstream division and higher downstream maintenance costs, partially offset by improved margins in the chemicals business, but results still easily beat Wall Street expectations. Q4 results were helped by ~$1B of non-cash effects that included U.S. deferred income tax items and the recognition of a favorable arbitration ruling for expropriated Venezuela assets. Q4 refining and marketing earnings fell by 54% Y/Y to $497M, while earnings in the chemical segment jumped 35% to $1.2B, boosted by stronger margins and low feedstock costs. E&P earnings fell 19% to $5.5B, hurt by lower production. Q4 oil and gas production dropped 3.8% on an oil-equivalent basis to a lower than expected 4.054M bbl/day; excluding the impact of the expiration of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession,  production fell 0.7%, with liquids up 3.6% and natural gas down  5.5%.

Rosneft had announced in September that it had found oil in the Kara Sea after drilling with XOM at the Universitetskaya-1 well, the most northerly in the world, and was due to restart drilling this year. The delay would be a blow to Russian Pres. Putin's goal of increasing output and securing the country's energy dominance by exploring the Arctic; oil resources in the Kara Sea alone are estimated to rival those of Saudi Arabia. |Jan. 29, 2015, 1:47 PM|Total beats BP, Shell to sign giant Abu Dhabi oil field deal

 France's Total (TOT +1.5%) is one of the day's few energy gainers after the surprise announcement of a new deal to operate some of the Persian Gulf's largest onshore oil fields in the United Arab Emirates. TOT is taking a 10% stake for 40 years in a joint venture with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company to extract crude in the 15 main fields in the UAE with a total output of 1.6M bbl/day. Four oil majors - TOT, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) and BP -  had each held 9.5% equity stakes in the ADCO concession since the 1970s. Concessions for international oil companies to produce on in the Persian Gulf Arab states such as the UAE are rare and highly prized due to the size of reserves and low production costs. |Jan. 29, 2015, 10:48 AM|Shell, Exxon sell stakes in North Sea field

 Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) sell their respective 25% stakes in the Sean field in the North Sea to Oranje-Nassau Energie for an undisclosed sum, as the collapse in oil prices since June has added to pressure on drillers to sell aging North Sea wells.

 Big oil companies such as Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) are betting too much on a return to higher oil prices, Citigroup says. The industry now looks to be adopting a slightly adjusted Plan A, with some capex cuts and cost-control but still with a fundamental view that higher oil prices will come to the rescue, CIti says, convinced that best results will be achieved only if the industry commits to full self-help action - Plan B - where the underlying principle is that oil prices may not recover any time soon.
Citi recommends buying the companies closest to moving to Plan B - Total (NYSE:TOT), BP and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) - and avoid those still stuck on Plan A - Exxon, Chevron and Shell. |Jan. 28, 2015, 2:41 PM|Exxon Mobil declares $0.69 dividend

 Despite the plunge in oil prices, a top Mexican energy official says global oil majors are showing interest in the initial phase of Mexico's bidding round for exploratory oil and gas blocks in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico that will be assigned by the government mid-year. The official says the shallow water round is in an area of the Gulf where there is already significant oil production and where costs are less than $20/bbl, making them attractive even in the current environment of depressed prices; a later phase involving more costly production in shale-rock formations will be cut back to offer only the most attractive of the unconventional resources.

North Dakota oil production rose to a new record even as energy  companies drilled fewer wells and the rig count dropped to a near  five-year low.
The state's oil output hit a record 1.19M bbl/day in  November, the most recent month available, according to data released  yesterday by North Dakota’s Department of Mineral Resources.
Despite the new record, the head of the department warned the state’s crude production will peak and  decline later this year if oil prices don’t rebound; the current price of North Dakota sweet crude is ~$29.25/bbl, the lowest since Dec. 2008.
The latest drilling rig count is 158, the lowest in nearly five years and down from a high of 218 rigs in 2012, but the department says production may not start to drop until the rig count falls to 130 or lower.
Gregor McDonald argues that the North Dakota data confirming that Bakken drilling activity has slowed meaningfully has sparked the snapback rally in crude oil prices.

 News reports about crude oil futures prices plunging through $50/bbl have been plentiful but many U.S. physical crude producers are receiving far less and would be thrilled if they could get $50, Reuters' John Kemp writes. Case in point: Prices received by oil producers in North Dakota's Williston Basin have averaged less than $34/bbl so far this month, according to Plains Marketing, falling by almost two-thirds since June when Plains posted an average price of nearly $92/bbl for Williston Sweet. The recent decline has been almost as rapid and brutal as 2008-09 when Williston prices crashed from $116 to less than $17. Kemp says past experience suggests extreme prices tend be relatively short-lived phenomena and followed by at least a partial correction, and thinks some sort of rebound is likely this time around in the next 2-3 months.

Investors in giant gas export terminals from Australia to Canada are facing the prospect of losing nearly $250B plowed into the projects during the past seven years, as weaker oil prices threaten to wipe out returns.
Oil-linked pricing means LNG producers stand to get much less revenue than expected on delivery of their first shipments, and oil prices have fallen so low that U.S. shale gas producers with plans to export the usually cheaper fuel to Asia suddenly find themselves facing a much tougher competitive environment.
LNG prices in Asia have sunk below $10/MMBtu, while most Australian LNG projects would need to sell the commodity for at least $12-$14 to break even; for example, the breakeven point for the $54B Gorgon project under construction by Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), is ~$17.7/MMBtu.

 Sinopec (SNP -1.4%) reportedly wants to sell some long-term liquefied natural gas import deals as a slowing Chinese economy and cheaper retail gas makes LNG imports unprofitable, signalling the end of a five-year boom fueled by rising Chinese demand. Reuters reports that SNP is planning to offload LNG from new export plants in Australia and potentially Papua New Guinea to BP, amid growing unease over the scale of an expansion that has seen the construction of 11 LNG import terminals since 2006 with plans for 25 more. SNP also may sell excess volumes coming from its stake in Exxon's (NYSE:XOM) Papua New Guinea LNG, in which it invested in 2009 when LNG prices were low but Chinese demand was expected to grow for decades to come.

 North Dakota issues strict new oil standards that will require energy companies operating in the state to strip explosive gases from crude oil that shows a high vapor pressure reading, in an effort to make crude-by-rail transport safer.
Under the new mandate, North Dakota oil can’t be transported unless it has a vapor pressure reading of 13.7 lbs./sq. in. or lower.
The rule, which will take effect on April 1, 2015, is the first major move by regulators to address the role of gaseous, volatile crude oil in railroad accidents which have been linked to several fiery explosions, including one last year in Quebec that killed 47 people.

 Global energy demand will rise 35% from 2010 to 2040, and renewable energy will be the fastest growing major energy source through 2040, Exxon Mobil (XOM -0.4%) says in its annual outlook on global energy.
XOM sees renewable energies such as wind, solar and biofuels growing 6%/year on average through 2040, at which point they will make up ~4% of global energy demand, while emissions in the developed world surge 50%.
North America is set to become a net exporter of oil and natural gas, and its production of unconventional will nearly triple by 2040, surpassing the combined output of Russia and the Caspian region as the largest gas-producing area, the report says. |Dec. 9, 2014, 10:58 AM|Oil industry’s multibillion-dollar projects come under new scrutiny

 ConocoPhillips' (COP +0.1%) move to cut next year's capital spending by 20%, including less on some large projects that are nearing completion, is a clear sign that big energy companies are taking a second look at their mega-projects costing billions of dollars as they face the fallout of declining oil prices, WSJ reports. Big companies seek out big projects in normal times, since they have the engineering expertise to develop fields beyond the grasp of smaller firms and need to keep adding reserves to offset production declines in mature areas, but oil at $63/bbl is not part of the equation; Shell (RDS.A +0.1%) says a new project must be able to break even at $70, and BP (BP -0.7%) says it uses a long-term planning price of ~$80 when considering new investments. Bernstein Research analyst Iain Pyle says companies will have to review big investments; if prices fail to rebound soon, “what we’re going to see is projects getting canceled.” Also: XOM -0.1%, CVX +0.2%. |Dec. 8, 2014, 12:30 PM|Denning: Climate improves for E&P acquisitions, including Exxon for BG

 M&A likely will become a bigger theme in the energy exploration and production sector in 2015, and Exxon Mobil (XOM -2%) is among companies rumored to be headed for a deal. XOM is said to be interested in BG Group (OTCPK:BRGXF, OTCQX:BRGYY); with XOM's long-term growth plans in Russia at risk in today’s environment, the company could use some new, exciting opportunities, and BG’s Brazilian assets or an E&P company’s U.S. shale prospects would fit the bill, WSJ's Liam Denning says. XOM may be spooked by its 2010 deal for XTO Energy, which helped cut its annual return on capital employed to 18% last year from 34% in 2008; BG's return on capital last year was ~10%. With XTO’s legacy still apparent, Denning says XOM needs a clear bargain price to sell a strategic deal to investors but the dismal outlook for oil prices could make it easier to do as next year unfolds.

The rout in oil prices has knocked $46M off the potential compensation for Nabors Industries (NYSE:NBR) CEO Anthony Petrello, the highest-paid oil executive in the U.S., whose future pay passed $100M in July but has fallen to $58M as shares in the company plunged 57% during the last five months.
“The land rig sector, of which Nabors is the biggest, is facing some severe headwinds on the earnings and cash flow they will make," says Credit Suisse analyst James Wicklund.
Petrello’s losses are almost twice as much as those of the next four highest-paid U.S. oil CEOs combined; Exxon’s (NYSE:XOM) Rex Tillerson, Conoco's (NYSE:COP) Ryan Lance, Schlumberger’s (NYSE:SLB) Paal Kibsgaard and Chevron's (NYSE:CVX) John Watson lost an average 19%, or ~$24M, of the value of their compensation since July 3, according to Bloomberg data.

 There's an increasing rate of reports of long lines at convenience store outlets across the U.S. as consumers rush to find sub-$2.50 gas. C-store chains are pricing aggressively in order to increase traffic into stores where margins tend to be higher. The sector has been identified by retail analysts as likely to outperform in Q4 due to the spending boost provided by lower gas prices (you could ski down the chart of retail gas prices over the last three months). Some forecast in-store spending will pop. Convenience store operators in the mix: Circle K (OTCPK:ANCUF), 7-11, Pantry (NASDAQ:PTRY), BP Connect (NYSE:BP), On the Run (NYSE:XOM), Speedway America (NYSE:MPC), Kwik Shop (NYSE:KR), Caseys General Stores (NASDAQ:CASY), and Qwiktrip.

Imperial Oil (NYSEMKT:IMO) says it has restarted production at the Kearl oil sands mine in Alberta to pre-shutdown levels after it halted operations last month because of a mechanical problem.
Exxon Mobil's (NYSE:XOM) Canadian subsidiary suspended production after detecting a vibration issue in the mine’s core ore-crushing machinery used to extract heavy oil; Kearl had averaged 92K bl/day of crude in Q3 prior to the halt.

Tullow offers “a significant operating position that would not look out  of place in the portfolio of a larger company,” says Societe Generale's David Mirzai, adding that the drop in oil prices “would certainly make it a  lot easier to win the investor base around than in previous years.”
Total (NYSE:TOT), Cnooc (NYSE:CEO) and Exxon (NYSE:XOM) would be among logical bidders since they’ve expressed interest in  African assets before, BMO says, adding that a buyer would not need  to contend with obstacles such as a poison pill or dual-class stock  structure.

 BofA Merrill Lynch downgrades the energy sector to Marketweight following OPEC’s decision to maintain rather than cut production, now seeing $70-$75 as Brent crude's 2015 range, while warning of value traps. "With the collapse in crude, the sector now trades at a 20% discount to the S&P 500, where it has historically traded in-line with the market," the firm says, "but further estimate cuts are likely to come, [as] prices are falling faster than earnings are deteriorating." Seeing WTI possibly falling as low as $50 in the coming month, BofA warns that "volatility in oil prices translates to volatility in earnings." For exposure to the sector, the firm prefers big, lower beta stocks such as Exxon Mobil (XOM +0.5%). Citi also cautions against assuming that oil prices have found a bottom, and wants to see a more thorough confirmation of a technical base of support  before proclaiming anything more than the latest trading bottom; however, Citi's Scott Gruber recommends moving aggressively on oil services if WTI crude falls into the $50s - his top picks, in order, are Baker Hughes (BHI +0.1%), Halliburton (HAL -1.3%) and Weatherford (WFT +2.7%).

Four years after the Deepwater Horizon disaster, giant new oil projects are returning to the Gulf of Mexico - bigger and more expensive than ever - even as U.S. oil prices are below $80/bbl at a four-year low.
New projects alone have the combined capacity to pump ~900K bbl/day: Hess (NYSE:HES) said Monday it had started pumping crude from its deepwater Tubular Bells installation, Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and Anadarko (NYSE:APC) plan to start up two more major Gulf projects in coming months, and Hess, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and other partners recently OK'd a $6B Gulf development.
Even BP is returning in a big way, with two Gulf projects and plans to spend $4B/year in the Gulf for the next decade, as it works on technology to drill at greater depths.
All this is happening even as costs are jumping, partly because companies are drilling farther from shore and in deeper waters; deepwater wells are up to 25% more expensive today than in 2010, and drilling the average deepwater Gulf well takes 13% longer than it did before the 2010 spill.
Shell’s (RDS.A, RDS.B) 100K bbl/day Olympus, which came online ahead of schedule and under budget, began tapping oil and gas in the Gulf in February; it is also working on a new Gulf project that will tap an oil field under 9,500 feet of water, 3x deeper than Olympus.

Regulators set to decide on rules for shipping crude oil via railroad are relying on testing methods that may understate the explosive risk of North Dakota crude, according to a WSJ report citing industry and Canadian officials.
The testing controversy centers on how to determine vapor pressure, a  measure of how quickly a liquid fuel evaporates and emits gases; the industry has long relied on a  decades-old methodology that does not require sealed or  pressurized containers to collect or test crude samples.
The North Dakota Industrial Commission is set to rule on what steps, if any, producers must take to strip volatile gases out of crude oil before loading it into railroad tank cars.

 Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and BP have lower profit margins than a decade ago, according to an analysis in a page one WSJ story, as the big oil stalwarts are shelving expansion plans and shedding operations. Combined, the four companies averaged a 26% profit margin on their oil and gas sales in the past 12 months vs. 35% a decade ago, according to the analysis. Shell said last week that its oil and gas production was lower than it was a decade ago and is likely to keep falling for the next two years; Exxon's output sank to a five-year low after the company disposed of less-profitable barrels in the Middle East. The companies’ sheer size has meant that only huge, complex and expensive projects are big enough to make a difference to the companies’ reserves and revenues; with oil prices now heading lower, such problems only look as though they’re going to get worse. |Oct. 31, 2014, 5:56 PM|Union workers ready for a fight with oil refiners as contract set to expire


United Steelworkers leaders, representing employees at two-thirds of U.S. refineries, are "looking for a fight" as they prepare to negotiate the next three-year contract with refiners, says the USW international VP who manages the union’s oil sector.
The USW is seeking a substantial increase in wages, stronger rules to prevent fatigue and measures to preserve the share of union workers rather than contract employees.
During the last round in 2012, USW and Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), which represented refiners, spent about a month in negotiations before agreeing to a national contract which was used as the foundation for forging refinery-by-refinery contracts with union locals.
An S&P index of refiners - including Exxon (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) and Tesoro (NYSE:TSO) - has more than doubled since the beginning of 2012, and the unions want a piece of the pie.

The cheapest crude oil in more than two years has the world’s two top oil producers, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX), glad they held onto their refineries when rivals were shunning the business.
Both companies reported better than expected  Q3 earnings today (I, II), with executives touting the importance  of owning massive refineries alongside oil and gas wells, "demonstrat(ing) the strength of our integrated business model," as XOM CEO Rex Tillerson says.

XOM’s Q3 profit from refining jumped, helping drive a 2.5% Y/Y increase in its total profit, while CVX’s refinery earnings more than tripled, propelling a 13% jump in overall profit; XOM said it sold U.S. oil for $89.60/bbl on average, down 12% Y/Y, while international barrels fetched $96.76, or 9.3% less, and CVX said its U.S. price fell $10/bbl to $87 as international prices fell $93 from $104.
But sustaining profits could be more of a challenge if demand for fuels continues to weaken around the world, which could limit output and profit gains at refining operations; also, refining profit margins already are shrinking as gasoline and diesel prices are dragged lower by the crude from which they’re derived.

YPF rose 2.5% today as Argentina lawmakers voted to approve a law revamping regulations on energy  investment, which could help the country boost its oil and gas production over the next two decades. The package of new laws cuts the minimum investment needed for companies to be exempt from import controls to $250M from $1B. Argentina offers considerable energy potential, ranking no. 3 in the world in shale gas reserves and no. 4 in shale oil, yet its refining capacity is limited and it imports energy products.

The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes says it was responding to a request from Venezuela's government for a  revision of the award, which was announced Oct. 9.

Although weaker oil prices mean energy companies and investors can expect lower profits in the coming months, big integrated oil majors may find their unloved oil refining businesses will soften the blow, according to a WSJ report.
For the likes of BP and Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), their refining operations become more profitable when the oil they use is cheaper; for each dollar-per-barrel of improved profit margin for refined products, BP generates $500M/year in extra pre-tax operating profit, and BP says that refining margin was $5.70/bbl higher in recent weeks than in Q4 of last year.
Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) may not see quite as big an improvement in refining margins as Shell and BP, as the glut of U.S. oil and natural gas and a ban on exporting most oil already gave U.S. refineries lower costs, but the U.S. companies still stand to benefit.
Low oil prices show “there is real advantage in having this integrated model,” Bernstein Research analyst Oswald Clint says.

Bakken shale oil producers are under pressure to scale back their 2015 drilling plans after Bakken oil fell below $80/bbl for the first time in nearly a year, as worldwide crude prices decline amid ample North American supplies and Persian Gulf producers signaling they’re prepared to keep output high to protect their market shares in Asia.
The "body language" among producers is that capex next year will be flat or only slightly higher, vs. earlier expectations for 5%-10% increases, says Topeka Capital's Gabriele Sorbara, who adds Bakken drillers need prices of $70-$80/bbl to earn a typical 15%-25% return.

 Venezuela's government confirms it will end up paying less than $1B to Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) due to this week's World Bank tribunal award, after it deducts a previous award made against it by another tribunal, the International Chamber of Commerce. Venezuela is hailing the outcome as a victory for its sovereignty over Western multinationals, but XOM also has expressed satisfaction, saying the decision vindicated its view it had not been properly compensated.

The cost of Kashagan, already the world’s most expensive oil project, is set to rise by at least $3.6B as the companies developing it are forced to replace more than 200 miles of leaking pipelines, FT reports.
The consortium - which includes Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), Exxon (NYSE:XOM), Total (NYSE:TOT), Eni  (NYSE:E) and CNPC (NYSE:PTR) - marked first production at the Kazakhstan field in September  last year after spending $50B on its development, but production has been shut ever since, when sulfur-containing gas was discovered  leaking from pipelines between the field and the shore.

FT says that a  meeting of a Kazakhstan government group was told this week that the cost of replacing the pipelines and  restarting production had been estimated at $1.6B-$3.6B,  depending on the equipment chosen, and that the consortium would choose the more expensive, more corrosion-resistant option.

The PDVSA official reportedly says Venezuela will not seek to annul the $1.6B award from the World Bank because the final amount is expected to be closer to $1B after a previous award by the International Chamber of Commerce is deducted. The official calls the award "a triumph," since XOM had asked for much more, adding PDVSA would pay as of November after servicing its ~$3B 2014 bond.

 Canada scores a victory as the European Union abandons plans to label oil sands as dirtier than other forms of crude, removing a major potential obstacle to exporting the fuel to Europe. The watering down of the proposals, the result of strong lobbying by Canada, means that oil suppliers will be able to put oil from tar sands in the same category as conventional oil, whereas it would previously have been designated as 25% more carbon-intensive. EU sources say the desire for a trade deal with Canada was a factor given the  situation with Russia.

Malaysia’s Petronas makes its most specific threat yet to delay development of its proposed C$10B Pacific Northwest natural gas export terminal on Canada's Pacific coast, as CEO Shamsul Azhar Abbas says the Canadian and British Columbia governments must commit to lower taxes by the end of this month to meet its mid-December target for a final decision.
The CEO says “current project economics appear marginal” based on the company's latest internal assessment, and that if Petronas is unable to move forward with the project this year it probably would not reconsider the Canadian Pacific coast “until the next LNG marketing window, anticipated in 10-15 years.”
In April, Petronas sold a 15% stake in the project to Sinopec (NYSE:SNP); earlier, Japan Petroleum Exploration and Indian Oil Corp. each took 10% stakes.

Liquefied natural gas projects in Africa, Canada and Australia face delays or even cancellation as global demand growth slows and U.S. output increases, Goldman Sachs says in a new report.
Worldwide demand for LNG will grow 5%/year compounded by 2020 and 4% by 2025, the firm says after previously forecasting growth of 6% and 5%, respectively.
Even the U.S. will not be spared from the pullback given the substantial contracts signed in recent years with U.S. LNG projects, Goldman says, adding that "investors should seek exposure to low-cost LNG export capacity, and be realistic about expectations for further contracts.”
Several projects in Canada and Australia likely will face deferrals due to uncertain production costs and price-sensitive buyers, with Papua New Guinea having perhaps the lowest risks as it expands LNG production, Goldman says.
"Given the industry’s renewed focus on capital discipline in recent times, we are observing a number of high-cost LNG projects deprioritized in the investment queue by major companies" such as Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), BG Group (OTCPK:BRGXF, OTCQX:BRGYY) and Exxon (NYSE:XOM).

Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) had  secured the best strategic position of any western oil company in  Russia, but instead its Russian ambitions are on ice because of western sanctions, and questions about its sluggish  growth and weak share price performance vs. some leading rivals are returning to the fore.
"Russia was going to be Exxon’s next mega-area, and the list of mega-areas in the world is very short," says Wolfe Research's Paul Sankey.

FT reports many Russian oil executives believe western sanctions will prove relatively short-lived, but some analysts think the Russians may overestimate U.S. willingness  to sacrifice foreign policy goals to help American businesses.
If the road in Russia remains blocked, analysts say XOM could use its financial strength to invest more in the U.S. oil and gas boom; rumors have swirled about an XOM bid for Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC), BG Group (OTCPK:BRGXF, OTCQX:BRGYY) or even BP, an option that could be particularly attractive if weak oil prices put pressure on company valuations.

 The Russian Arctic is not the only offshore  region generating a potential political problem for Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), as Forbes' Tim Threadgold thinks XOM also faces the possible loss of the giant Scarborough gas field off the coast of western Australia. The ultra-deepwater Scarborough is a difficult field to develop, not  just because of its location but also because of Australia’s high  domestic costs and the gas contains limited amounts of  high-profit liquids.
Threadgold says a recent statement from partner BHP Billiton (NYSE:BHP) that the company was focusing on North American oil and gas  opportunities because they offer higher rates of return on investment could play into the hands of an Australian company - Fortescue Metals (OTCPK:FSUMF) - which would like to own  Scarborough, and theoretically could do so without paying XOM and BHP a dollar under  Australia's “use it or lose it” laws. |Sep. 23, 2014, 6:49 PM|Exxon, Chevron steady but provide little cause for excitement, JPM says

The U.S. and EU are said to be close to imposing the toughest round of energy sanctions yet, which would hit both Russia's energy industry and companies such as Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) that are working with Rosneft (OTC:RNFTF) and other state-controlled companies.
The sanctions reportedly would ban U.S. and European companies from working with Russia on future oil exploration in the Russian Arctic, deep seas and shale rock formations; the move would go beyond previously reported proposals to widen curbs on technologies for the oil industry.
The sanctions would not affect current oil production but could imperil the future of existing partnerships, including a deal between XOM and Rosneft to drill in the Arctic Ocean; other vulnerable oil majors would include BP, Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), Statoil (NYSE:STO) and Total (NYSE:TOT).

Energy stocks, especially refiners, are taking a beating following the latest EIA inventory report that said gasoline stockpiles rose by 2.4M barrels last week, helping send U.S. crude oil futures to 16-month lows (-1.2% to $91.61/bbl) and Brent crude to 17-month lows (-1.1% to $98.02).
The report is bearish given the large increases in refined product  inventories; "even though the crude drawdown was close to  expectations, it seemed to disappoint," Again Capital's John Kilduff says.
The EIA report followed the agency’s updated demand growth report issued yesterday and this morning’s release of OPEC’s report on the oil market; both see lower demand growth this year and next.
Oil majors are mostly lower: XOM -0.6%, CVX -1.4%, COP -0.3%, but BP (+2.9%) and RDS.A (+1%) are higher.

Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), BP, TransCanada (NYSE:TRP) and the state of Alaska, working together to develop a pipeline and liquefied natural gas plant, have submitted a formal  request to the FERC to start an  environmental review required for siting, design and permitting for  construction.
The planned 800-mile pipeline from Alaska’s North Slope to a liquefaction plant in Nikiski on the southern coast’s Cook  Inlet would carry as much as 3.5B cf/day of natural gas.
The Alaska LNG project is in the pre-engineering and design  phase, which is expected to be completed by 2016 and cost ~$500M, but total investment costs could hit $45B-$65B before all is said and done.

Analysts were out with opinions on some of the oil majors, although their comments had little impact on stock prices with energy stocks broadly tumbling today and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) among the biggest drags on the Dow.
Oppenheimer came out in favor of CVX, reiterating its Outperform rating and raising its price target to $140 from $130 to reflect an improving operating and financial outlook; the firm was more muted on XOM, where returns are declining in part because capital spending and operating costs continue to rise, as the low-hanging fruit has been picked, and major project schedules continue to get longer, boosting unproductive capital.
Morgan Stanley wrote favorably about Total (NYSE:TOT) and Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), which the firm says offer particularly attractive combinations of free cash flow growth and dividend yield, while offering a pessimistic view of XOM and BP, seeing little reason to expect capex to come down for both, thus leading to more lackluster free cash flow prospects.

"Most of the reason that banks are underearning relative to their historical norms ... is economic and not regulatory," says Richard Pzena (NYSE:PZN), who remains bullish on the TBTFs. Low interest rates, weak trading, and "government persecution" are the three factors, and - should these normalize - earnings could nearly double at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C), though JPMorgan's (NYSE:JPM) boost would be more modest. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is another favorite.
Broad financial ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, SEF, IYG, FXO, FNCL, FINU, RWW, RYF, FINZ

Another cheap sector is energy, says Pzena, and based on relative valuation against the broader market - whether price-to-book or price-to-earnings - the major integrated oil companies are selling near all-time lows.
What the market is missing, says Pzena, is the nature of oil investment. The old days saw capital spending one year, and boosted volume the next. Projects nowadays are far larger and require several years of spending before returns roll in. "We think those big new projects are going to perform and produce decent returns."

|Aug. 14, 2014, 7:15 PM|Cheniere, Exxon are big winners in overhaul of natural gas export reviews

 The U.S. Energy Department has finalized its plan to revamp the process for approving liquefied natural gas exports, largely codifying a process first proposed in May. Beginning immediately, the DoE will only issue final rulings on whether exports are in the public interest after the FERC has completed an environmental review of the project.
The benefits of the change extend unevenly to the dozens of companies  now vying to export U.S. natural gas, and some in the industry say the new process will exacerbate permitting delays for most companies.
The biggest winner under the new approach is Cheniere  Energy (NYSEMKT:LNG), which already had gained FERC approval but faced a nearly two-year wait  for the required Energy Department review of its proposed Sabine Pass expansion; it now moves to the front of the line to get a permit from the DoE.
Another winner is Exxon's (NYSE:XOM) Golden Pass project in  southeast Texas, which also was far down the Energy Department’s list,  even though it was well into the FERC review.
The new policy will not affect companies that already have received conditional approvals, such as Dominion's (NYSE:D) Cove Point project, Sempra's (NYSE:SRE) Cameron LNG project and Leucadia National's (NYSE:LUK) Oregon LNG project.

Jones analyst Brian Yarborough attributes the limp sales growth for Wal-Mart in the U.S. to the retailer's inability to nab the quick "milk and bread" runs by consumers due to the massive size of its stores.

But lawyers for land and mineral rights owners who have sued  CLR over what they say are unpaid royalties believe the company's main goal is to minimize its liability as the state finally  moves to curb flaring; natural gas that is pumped out of the ground  along with more valuable oil is burned at a much higher rate in North  Dakota than in other crude-producing states.

 While BP (BP -3%) earlier today became the first big western company to openly admit that sanctions against Russia could hurt its business, BP execs later were eager to justify their long-term commitment to Russia as well as the rationale for maintaining a position in the country. "Russia is the largest oil and gas producing country on the planet, and the world is going to to need 40% more energy between now and 2035. That’s why you can see many, many, many international companies working in Russia," CEO Bob Dudley says. It's true that Exxon (XOM -0.4%) and Chevron (CVX -0.2%) are notable among other oil majors which hold minority interests and strategic partnerships with Russia oil companies, but BP’s exposure makes it much more susceptible to political headwinds via its associations with Rosneft (OTC:RNFTF), says Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets.

The companies are pulling out of more conflict-torn and difficult regions: CVX sold its assets in Chad this year, XOM has sold project stakes in Iraq and Indonesia, and Shell since 2010 has sold $1.8B of its Nigerian assets and last year began talks to sell four oil production blocks and a pipeline there.
Places like the U.S., Canada and the U.K. - which has opened bidding for its next set of onshore oil and gas exploration licenses - are more expensive to operate in, and regulations are tighter, but their political stability makes them more predictable.

 Exxon Mobil (XOM -1.2%) is downgraded to Underweight from Equal Weight at Barclays, primarily due to its relative valuation in the belief that potential upside is limited compared to peers. XOM will continue to face relative headwinds concerning the lack of meaningful near-term production growth and the likelihood of a relatively steady high oil price environment, Barclays believes. The firm recommends switching out of XOM to ConocoPhillips (COP -0.3%), Imperial Oil (IMO -1.3%) or Suncor (SU -0.3%). Barclays also cuts Cenovus Energy (CVE -1.7%) to Equal Weight from Overweight, seeing operating issues at Foster Creek and Pelican Lake remaining a drag on shares over the next several quarters (Briefing.com). |Jul. 25, 2014, 2:58 PM|Tanzania offers promising natural gas outlook, IMF says


Tanzania has a strong chance of becoming a major producer and exporter of natural gas over the next decade, according to the IMF, noting significant offshore discoveries made in the last 2-3 years and further exploration now underway.
Although gas resources haven’t yet been declared commercially viable, estimates of discoveries indicate recoverable offshore gas resources of at least 24T-26T cf, potentially sufficient for a four-train liquid natural gas plant, the IMF says.

 Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is weighing a possible multibillion-dollar expansion of its 344K bbl/day Beaumont, Tex., refinery that could make it the largest in the U.S. by 2020, Reuters reports. XOM is said to be considering an expansion to 700K-800K bbl/day in total refinery capacity at Beaumont, which would surpass Motiva's 600K-plus bbl/day Port Arthur refinery. XOM reportedly is focusing on the possible addition of a  third crude distillation unit at the refinery, and its size would determine how much capacity would increase; the plans also would include replacing four coking unit drums and adding two new coker drums. |Jul. 23, 2014, 3:15 PM|Colombia oil auction disappoints, but Exxon dives in

 Colombia announces disappointing results from its first oil auction in two years, drawing investment commitments totaling $1.4B which were well short of the $2.6B the government said it was expecting. Submitted offers did include a few big names, as Exxon Mobil (XOM +0.6%) and Statoil (STO -0.1%) landed the rights to explore a new Caribbean Sea deepwater block in partnership with Repsol (OTCQX:REPYY, OTCPK:REPYF).

Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is determined to move forward with plans to explore the Russian Arctic for oil and gas: Just two days after the downing of a passenger airliner over Ukraine led to  mounting pressure for new sanctions  against Russia, a drilling rig to be operated by XOM and partner Rosneft (OTC:RNFTF) set sail from Norway for Russia.
For XOM, the deal - which was reached in 2011 - offers access to the  Arctic in the Russian-controlled areas of the ocean, as drilling in the U.S. and Canadian far north remains bogged down in regulation and  lawsuits; the Russian oil industry depends on Western technical aid for offshore  drilling, delivered through joint venture partnerships such as the XOM agreement.
It is unclear how or if XOM could recoup its initial $3.2B investment in the exploration phase of the venture if sanctions on Rosneft are broadened.

The problem facing Canada isn't the Keystone pipeline or Pres. Obama or environmentalists - it's the oil sands, and they've got to be cleaned up and the head-in-the-sand denials chased way or the country will be stuck with a "baby seal hunt" image, Diane Francis writes in the Financial Post.
The columnist thinks she knows the right person to lead the clean-up: Jeff Immelt - "an American leader with stature in Washington, on Wall Street, in the oil patch and in Silicon Valley" - who said this week that GE will help companies clean up the oil sands.
The only way to stop the environmental excuses, Immelt believes, is for the industry to collaborate and voluntarily establish lower emissions targets that would make the oil sands competitive with any other fuel source in the world - without such a promise to provide cleaner energy, "all bets are off."

Exxon Mobil (XOM) is making a contrarian bet to boost its struggling European refining business with its plan to invest more than $1B in expanding diesel fuel production at its big refinery in Antwerp, Belgium.
XOM’s head of refining for Europe and most other  non-U.S. regions says the company is taking a long-term view on diesel: “If you look at Europe, demand for  diesel continues to increase and demand for gasoline is decreasing."
Big shifts in the European auto fleet have caused huge changes in fuel  consumption; car and truck drivers in the EU now burn at least 2.5x more diesel than gasoline, while the use was even a decade ago.

Energy companies invested hundreds of millions of dollars when they started extracting oil from shale formations in south Texas a few years ago to make the volatile crude was safer to handle, but the failure to do so at the Bakken shale is coming back to haunt the oil industry as the U.S. government seeks to prevent fiery accidents of trains containing North Dakota oil.
Only one stabilizer, which can remove the most volatile gases before transport, has been built in North Dakota and it hasn't begun operation, according to a WSJ review; if the government mandates the use of stabilizers, companies would have to make big investments in equipment which could slow Bakken's development.
Oil producers are fighting the perception that the biggest risks come from Bakken crude, almost all of which is moved by rail, but safety officials and lawmakers say the dangers extend far beyond North Dakota.

North Dakota regulators tell crude oil explorers to cut  the flaring of natural gas or face limits on the amount of oil they can pump from the Bakken shale formation.
The state's crude output has surpassed 1M bbl/day, behind only Texas, but while Texas captures all but 1% of the natural gas produced, North Dakota burns 30% of its output as waste as the rate of production has outstripped companies' ability to capture gas through pipeline connections at the source.

New York’s cities and towns can block fracking within their borders, the state’s highest court rules, upholding the dismissal of lawsuits challenging bans in two small upstate towns.
The ruling could lead the oil and gas industry to abandon fracking in New York, or it could mean that a patchwork of rules eventually may govern whether exploration can take place across the state; the case also may invigorate local challenges to the practice in states across the U.S.

 All U.S. crude oil that is processed by a distillation tower - not just condensate - is exempt from the crude export ban, potentially widening the amount of petroleum U.S. producers can send to markets abroad, Reuters reports, citing U.S. government and industry sources. By focusing on how the oil is treated rather than what it is, this week's ruling allowing two companies that produce condensate to export the oil if it is processed by a distillation tower appears to open an option for companies that produce traditional crude to get around the export ban by lightly boiling their own oil, the report says. The new interpretation of the ruling will add to the speculation over how much of the U.S. shale oil boom might reach overseas markets.

 Exxon Mobil (XOM) reportedly is prepared to take over as operator of the Kashagan field in an effort to fix the beleaguered $50B project offshore Kazakhstan. Discussions are continuing but Exxon could be appointed as soon as at the end of June, the publication Nefte Compass quoted a senior Kazakh official as saying. Kashagan production started last September after numerous delays but was halted in October after the discovery of gas leaks in the pipeline network, and output may not restart until 2016. The other Kashagan shareholders are Eni (E), Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), Total (TOT) and Kazakh state oil company KazMunaiGas, each with 16.8%, and Japan's Inpex and China National Petroleum (PTR) as junior partners.

BP, Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are among two dozen U.S. refiners sued by Vermont's AG and accused of polluting the state’s groundwater with the gasoline additive MTBE.
The suit is one of scores of claims filed by cities, states and individuals around the U.S. against oil refiners, retailers and distributors over MTBE; an XOM spokesperson says the basis of MTBE litigation is flawed because companies are being held liable for including oxygenates in gasoline that were required by Congress and approved by federal regulators.

Norwegian onshore oil workers break off pay negotiations with employers, increasing the risk of a strike, as the industry fails to achieve full or partial deals in three separate discussions with workers on offshore platforms, supply bases and at oil service companies.
The Industry Energy union, which represents more than 75% of 5K onshore workers at companies like Statoil (STO) and BP, ended talks yesterday; negotiations now move to public mediation, where failure may result in a strike.
A strike would cut off ~50K bbl/day of oil at Exxon's (XOM) Ringhorne, Jotun and Baler fields, 28K bbl/day of oil and 11M cm/day of gas at GDF Suez’s (GDFZY) Gjoea field, and 22K bbl/day of oil from STO’s Vega field that goes through Gjoea.

The new Russia-China gas deal, along with a new trend of setting prices linked to gas prices rather than the traditional crude oil benchmarks, could upset western Canada's plans for launching a liquefied natural gas export industry, according to a new report by TD Bank.
"With so much LNG supply capacity set to come on stream, Asian buyers  have more power to bargain for lower prices in LNG contracts, lowering  the potential prices Canadian producers would receive, and could squeeze  the economics of certain LNG projects,” TD says.
Canadian projects still offer attractive spreads and proximity to Asian  markets despite the challenges, but proponents must move quickly to grab first-mover advantage, TD says as it expects  two LNG projects to secure final investment decisions before the end of  the year.

 Exxon Mobil (XOM +0.1%) CEO Rex Tillerson says U.S. sanctions against Russian officials, including Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin, are having no effect on his company's activities there, adding that he finds such steps typically ineffective. Tillerson tells shareholders at the annual meeting the travel ban on Sechin has not affected collaboration with XOM, which is working with Rosneft to drill an exploratory well in the Arctic this year. The CEO also says alternative fuels will grow but that  oil will remain the world’s leading source of energy for another quarter century; he believes technology will provide an answer to climate change,  and says proponents of ideas such as hard emissions reduction goals  are simplistic. |May 27, 2014, 8:47 AM|Exxon ships Papua New Guinea LNG ahead of schedule


Exxon Mobil (XOM) said this weekend it shipped the first cargo of liquefied natural gas from the $19B PNG LNG project in Papua New Guinea ahead of schedule.
Early completion of the project is helpful for XOM, which is under pressure from investors to find new sources of revenue to boost sagging profits; it's also good news for Papua New Guinea, but it isn't clear whether the country will be able to avoid the resource curse that befalls many developing nations that suddenly receive an influx of cash.
PNG LNG is expected to produce more than 9T cf of gas over its estimated 30 years of operations, starting with the first shipment to Tokyo Electric Power.

The first cargo of crude oil to be exported by pipeline from Iraqi  Kurdistan has left a Turkish port  by ship, bound for another European destination.
A tanker loaded with more than 1M barrels of crude oil departed last night from Ceyhan, "the first of many such sales," the Kurdistan Regional Government says.
The move by the semi-autonomous region defies Baghdad's objections and may encourage other regional authorities to bypass the central government.

Opinions are mixed on Linn Energy's (LINE +0.4%; LNCO +0.4%) acreage swap with a unit of Exxon Mobil (XOM -0.5%) that adds production of ~85M cfe/day for Linn. Raymond James analysts call it "quantitatively, an ideal swap," since Linn is essentially trading production that is declining at ~35%/year for gas properties that are declining at 6%, resulting in much more stable cash flow; also, the deal allows Linn to lever its already large Hugoton position to help deliver more operating synergies. Citigroup’s Faisel Khan is not so sure Linn got the better of the deal: Linn estimates net accretion to distributable cash flows of $0.09-$0.12 per unit on an annualized basis, but Linn is giving up upside from the Midland basin assets resulting from additional capital spending later this year. |May 22, 2014, 11:48 AM|Cnooc, Gazprom eye Tanzania oil and gas blocks

 Traders say ExxonMobil's (XOM) Papua New Guinea gas liquefaction plant should export ~20 cargoes during the project's start-up phase lasting until September. The rapid export rate from the new plant, which was completed slightly ahead of schedule, has helped push global LNG prices lower as major Japanese buyers retreat from spot markets. XOM will sell most of its output to buyers with which it has long-term supply deals, such as Tokyo Electric Power and Osaka  Gas, allowing them to fill needs without resorting to price-sensitive spot purchases. |May 19, 2014, 8:28 AM|Imperial Oil seeks Arctic well as much as six miles deep

Large oil companies are betting more than $1T on large-scale, “high-risk” projects over the next decade, and investors should question the assumptions underpinning that spending, urges the Carbon Tracker Initiative.
The think tank advises oil investors to require annual stress tests of oil companies’ sensitivity to a low-price scenario, and to ask what demand and price assumptions underpinned companies’ spending strategy, as some major pension funds already have begun to do.
Among companies with the highest exposure to such high-risk projects, as measured in dollar terms, are Petrobras (PBR), Exxon (XOM), Rosneft (RNFTF), Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) and Total (TOT), the CTI says in a new report.

Coca-Cola (KO) is a long-time Berkshire holding, fitting with Buffett's buy and hold forever strategy; the dividend yields 3.15%.
Procter & Gamble (PG) is a long-time holding; it just announced another 7% dividend hike and yields 3.18%.
Wells Fargo (WFC) is Buffett’s favorite bank and is the largest position in the Berkshire portfolio; while it yields only ~2.4% now, it telegraphed a quarterly dividend raise to $0.35/share for a new yield of 2.87%.

"Suspicions have emerged" that there may be microcracks in the offshore stretch of the pipeline, the minister says, but if cracks are found only onshore. then output probably could resume this year. Exxon (XOM), Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), Total (TOT), Eni (E) and state oil company KazMunaiGas each hold 16.81% stakes in Kashagan. |Apr. 4, 2014, 12:26 PM|Caspian Oil pipeline partners to review expansion timing as BG sees delays

 Exxon Mobil (XOM +0.1%) agrees to publicly disclose more details on the risks of fracking, reversing a long-held resistance after negotiations with environmental groups and investors.XOM's report, expected in September, will cover how the company manages risks from fracking in shale rock formations, including impacts to air quality, water and chemical usage as well as damage to roads; the report will not include data on methane that leaks from its operations into the atmosphere.After publishing earlier this week a report on how it would be affected by regulations limiting carbon emissions, the new disclosures clearly mark a change in tone for XOM. |Apr. 3, 2014, 2:57 PM|Kashagan oil field seen unlikely to restart this summer


Production at the giant Kashagan oil field in Kazakhstan is unlikely to restart this summer, as the companies involved in the consortium running the project are still awaiting a report on a gas leak that closed the field last October, WSJ reports.
Resuming output is important, so the companies - which include Exxon (XOM), Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), Total (TOT) and Eni (E) - can start generating revenue to recoup some of the $50B they have spent on Kashagan over the last 17 years.
It may be even more critical for the Kazakh government, which had based its economic forecasts on revenue from Kashagan, where output was expected to ramp up to 370K bbl/day from 180K bbl/day initially.

Canada's National Energy Board says it will hold public hearings into Kinder Morgan Partners' (KMP) planned $5.4B expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline that carries crude from the Alberta oil sands to the Pacific coast, first hearing evidence from aboriginal groups in August.
The regulator, which plans to issue a recommendation on the project's future no later than July 2015, says its review will focus on 12 issues, including impact on the environment, effects on marine shipping, aboriginal interests, and contingency planning for spills and accidents.
Energy producers such as Exxon (XOM) affiliate Imperial Oil (IMO), BP and Suncor (SU) are looking to the Trans Mountain expansion and other proposed pipelines - most notably Keystone XL (TRP) - to help ease the bottlenecks that have led to steep discounts for Alberta oil on global markets.
|Apr. 2, 2014, 7:02 PM|Imperial Oil still working out the kinks at Kearl oil sands mine

 Imperial Oil (IMO, XOM) has spent more than expected in ramping up production at its Kearl oil sands mining operation in Alberta, but CEO Rich Kruger believes the company has learned enough from the problems to ensure a smoother start when it opens the C$8.9B second phase later this year or early next. Production at Kearl averaged 70K bbl/day in Q1, up from 52K bbl/day during last year's Q4 but still well below the 110K capacity.
Operating costs of $30/bbl for the initial phase for exceeded some analyst expectations of $20/bbl, and RBC now expects operating costs of $29-$32 falling to $24-$28 once the second phase starts up; by contrast, Suncor (SU) expects operating costs for its Fort Mills mine at $20-$24/bbl. Despite the start-up problems, Kruger says the heavy oil produced at Kearl is gaining wide acceptance from refiners; ~21 North American refineries have bought the oil, while a refinery in Malaysia also acquired some cargoes by tanker from the Port of Vancouver.

 ExxonMobil (XOM -0.2%) says it will blend oil liquids from its PNG LNG gas export project in Papua New Guinea into the country's only crude blend, nearly doubling crude exports by the middle of the year.
The quality changes are not likely to be significant, but the rise in number  of monthly cargoes could make the blend more attractive to regional  refiners seeking steady supply of light sweet crude.
The $19B project is due to begin exports in mid-2014 of 6.9M metric tons/year of liquefied natural gas and produce 25K bbl/day of condensate that will be blended into  the country's existing export stream. |Apr. 1, 2014, 3:19 PM|Rosneft, with U.S. partner Exxon, on track with LNG plant

 Rosneft (RNFTF) says it is on track to start production at its first liquefied natural gas plant in Russia's far east in 2018-19, and signals that its partnership with Exxon Mobil (XOM -0.3%) for building the plant will not be affected, despite tension over Ukraine. Rosneft says current LNG prices in Asia, at more than $15/MBtu, would enable it to successfully carry out its LNG project, which will have an initial annual capacity of 5M metric tons.
Rosneft also says it expects its gas output this year to rise to ~55B cubic meters and to more than 63B next year.

Exxon Mobil (XOM) dismisses any notion that it would retreat  from oil sands and deepwater reservoirs amid potentially stringent  carbon regulations in the future, saying fossil fuel production will continue to be key to meeting global  energy demand for decades.

XOM's report on the risks that climate change policies  could pose to the company's assets and future profitability - the first detailed response to these concerns by a major oil company - acknowledges the need to adopt policies to address climate change, but  it concludes that governments are highly unlikely to  adopt policies that cut emissions so sharply that oil and gas  consumption would be severely restricted.
Some investors have argued that XOM's shareholder value could be put at risk if oil  producers were unprepared for a future of constrained fossil fuel  production under tougher climate rules.

The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration approves Exxon Mobil's (XOM) plan to restart operations for the 210-mile Texas leg of its Pegasus pipeline that a year ago spilled ~5K barrels of oil into a residential area in Arkansas.
The federal regulator had accused XOM of failure to account  for risks in the 70-year old pipeline and said the company could face  ~$2.7M in fines.
Last year, Sunoco Logistics (SXL) delayed a West Texas to Nederland  pipeline project linked to Pegasus because of the shutdown; it is not clear what impact the restart will have on that  project.

Four global energy majors, 10 man-made islands and nearly $50B have added up to zero barrels of current oil production, as WSJ profiles the landmark Kashagan "elephant” project gone awry.
It’s a story of sky-high investment at a time of record-high oil prices that is generating very little in return, as well as the sort of uncapped spending that has characterized the push into new frontiers is now being reined in.
The project - co-developed by Eni (E), Total (TOT), Exxon (XOM) and Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) - has been plagued by budget blowouts, engineering missteps and management disputes, and miles of leaky pipeline make up what is arguably the world's most expensive plumbing problem.
If the era of big spending is to continue - if the push into the Arctic or deep-offshore Brazil or uncharted territories like Mozambique and Myanmar is going to succeed - then the price of crude may have to move higher.

 Oil Search (OISHF) is contesting Total’s (TOT) agreement earlier this week to acquire a 40% stake in InterOil’s (IOC) natural gas discoveries in Papua New Guinea, a dispute which could require international arbitration to be resolved. The dispute surrounds stakes in the Elk and Antelope fields, coveted because the gas could be used either for a possible expansion of a $19B liquefied natural gas project that ExxonMobil (XOM) is building with Oil Search, or for a rival project. Analysts say the outcome of the dispute is unclear, but some speculate Oil Search's aim may be to keep the door open to XOM to enter the Elk-Antelope joint venture.
Meanwhile, IOC has spudded its third well in as many weeks in Papua New Guinea with up to five more planned over the next year or so. |Mar. 27, 2014, 11:55 AM|Investors shifting cash into energy ETFs on expectations of oil gains


Investors are pouring money into energy companies, putting 7x as much into energy sector ETFs as they did last quarter and betting that profits of energy producers rise along with crude oil and natural gas prices.
Energy collecting new money reflects optimism for a turnaround in companies like Exxon Mobil (XOM), XLE's biggest holding, but the bet may not pay off, as analysts generally foresee lower global oil prices in 2014 and gains in gas.

 South Africa’s ruling African National Congress has used its parliamentary majority to push through changes to minerals laws that companies such as Exxon Mobil (XOM) and BHP Billiton (BHP) say will hurt investment.
The new law will secure for the state a free 20% stake in all new energy ventures and enable it to buy an unspecified additional share at an "agreed price,” and it enable the mines minister to declare some minerals strategic and force companies processing them to sell some output to local manufacturers.
Rules for energy companies were made more onerous after lawmakers scrapped a 50% cap on the size of the stake the state may demand in new projects, which would have “a chilling effect" on investment, according to a trade association whose members include XOM, BHP, Anadarko (APC) and Total (TOT). |Mar. 11, 2014, 3:34 AM|Crimea crisis brings uncertainty to energy giants

 Kazakhstan's government is suing foreign oil companies developing its huge Kashagan oilfield in the Caspian Sea, a tactic used earlier in securing the government large stakes in two of the three multinational energy projects on its territory. The development consortium, led by Exxon (XOM), Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), Total (TOT) and Eni (E) as well as Kazakh state oil firm KazMunaiGas, may face Kazakhstan seizing a bigger stake in Kashagan or refusing to reimburse part of the $50B spent on bringing it onstream. Repeated delays at Kashagan have infuriated the government; production finally began in September after 13 years but was stopped a few weeks later after gas was found to be leaking from its pipelines. The government says its checks show the volume of gas burned off after the discovery of the leak totaled 2.8M cubic meters, and thus is claiming $737M against the consortium.

Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares have added a puny 7% during the past year, and the consensus is that the stock probably will not rebound anytime soon, as the company prepares for at least a year of transition with spending cuts and project shifts to reduce  costs and improve margins and volumes.
XOM must  constantly replace production from declining wells with new spigots of  oil and gas; last year, its reserve replacement measure was positive by a  narrow 103%.
After a decade of considering its internal benchmark for return on capital employed at 35%, XOM's 2013 ROCE was just 17% in a year when oil remained near historic highs at ~$100/bbl.
Total debt at year-end 2013 was $22.7B, up by $11.1B Y/Y, and cash fell $4.9B; Morgan Stanley figures XOM will need $11B annual free cash inflection to support current distributions without using the balance sheet.
Worries over political risk in Russia are real: XOM already has put its Ukraine offshore natural gas prospect on hold, although it is pressing ahead with other large-scale investments in Russia, as well as a Black Sea oil project just east of Crimea.

Investors supposedly want the oil majors to rein in spending, but when Exxon Mobil (XOM) outlines a plan to do precisely that - promising to cut capital expense by ~6.4% this year and keeping it up in the years beyond - shares sink nearly 3%, making it the Dow's worst performer of the day.

The market's reaction is perverse, in one sense, WSJ's Liam Denning writes; even if production targets are lower, growth is still expected and higher returns and free cash flow should offer support for its valuation; on the flip side, the hard truth is that XOM must rebuild credibility after missing production targets too many times before.

 Exxon Mobil (XOM -2.9%) is dropping more than at any time in the past year after it forecast flat production in 2014 on reduced capital spending.
However, RBC Capital's Peter Hutton isn't rattled by XOM's production guidance, noting that much of the downside has a relatively limited effect on cash flows and earnings as the production is in lower margin areas such as UAE and U.S. natural gas.
Also possibly weighing on shares is the potential delay of XOM's biggest non-U.S. exploration opportunity - XOM owns drilling rights to 11.4M acres of Russian land - if the U.S. hits Russia with sanctions over Ukraine; also at risk are plans to begin drilling in the Russian Arctic later this year in partnership with Rosneft and the lucrative Sakhalin-1 oil license off Russia’s Pacific coast. |Mar. 5, 2014, 9:46 AM|Exxon Mobil sees 2014 capex of $39.8B, down 6.4% from last year's peak

Western oil majors including Chevron (CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) likely will reassess deals to drill in Ukraine, where the political crisis threatens a promising source of new profits and the  country’s drive for energy independence.
Chevron and Shell signed deals last year to drill unexplored shale formations in  Ukraine, and Exxon was close to signing a pact to explore the Black Sea before the crisis erupted last year.

Following a string of explosive accidents on railcars carrying crude oil, a WSJ analysis finds that crude from North Dakota’s Bakken Shale formation contains several times more combustible gases than oil from elsewhere.
Nearly 1M bbl/day are being produced in North Dakota but with pipeline capacity unable to keep up with growth, railroads are the prime method of transporting the crude to refineries; the volatility of the crude, however, raises concerns that the cargo moving through the U.S. is more dangerous than previously believed.
Tanker cars full of oil pass through several major U.S. cities, and a repeat of what happened in last July's fatal derailment in Quebec in a densely populated area is a huge safety concern.

XOM boosted the 2013 year-end liquids component of its 25.2B boe in global reserves to 53% last year from 51% in 2012, the highest proportion in a decade and the third straight annual increase in the oil cut; 47% was gas. XOM cites the Upper Zakum oilfield in Abu Dhabi as a major source of new liquid reserves, as well as North American shale formations such as the Permian and Bakken. |Feb. 19, 2014, 2:58 PM|Occidental Petroleum leads Cowen's three favorite big oil stocks to buy

 The energy analysts at Cowen say that after three years of disappointment, 2014 is expected to bring stabilization and moderate growth with the potential for meaningful ramp-up in the sector during 2015-18. One of Cowen's three big oil favorites is Occidental Petroleum (OXY) after announcing plans to spin off its California assets into a separate company; the firm likes OXY's potential to see the full benefit of rising oil prices in future results without being weighed by refining or midstream operations.
The firm foresees margin expansion at Exxon Mobil (XOM) with incremental growth coming from liquids-linked output, and thinks capex will start to drop after this year. Cowen analysts also like Chevron (CVX) but would be patient buyers while awaiting commentary on further improvement due to better project mix.

The Alaska LNG project - backed by Exxon (XOM), BP and ConocoPhillips (COP) - and its plan to take gas 800 miles across the state from the North Slope to a new liquefaction plant on its south coast faces technical and  financial challenges, and it still needs to win the support of Alaska lawmakers, some of whom say the plan gives too much away  to the oil companies.
Analysts see the critical factor in securing customers for Alaska LNG as the competition between the project and plants being developed in  the rest of the U.S.; by  the time Alaska LNG is in production, other U.S. gas exports could be well established and Alaska LNG could be chasing a market that is already well supplied with gas.
To keep the plan on track as planned for a final go-ahead in 2018, it  needs approval from the state legislature in its present session, which  ends April 20.

 Exxon Mobil (XOM +0.5%) shares have dropped ~11% YTD amid disappointing earnings and declining production, but Argus analyst Michael Burke believes the market is overreacting to the bad news. Argus thinks investors have become too pessimistic about XOM's production profile (47% gas in Q4), and the negative sentiment is reflected in the stock's current valuation; XOM will remain the global energy leader and a superior allocator of capital, as demonstrated by its leading returns on invested capital, the firm says.
However, Oppenheimer’s Fadel Gheit warns that XOM’s problems could be just getting started, warning that lower oil prices could dim the earnings outlook; at $90 oil and $5 natural gas, XOM could not internally fund its share buyback, and at $80 oil it has to borrow to fund capex and dividends.

 Exxon Mobil (XOM -1.6%) says it is boosting its presence in the Permian Basin in Texas through an agreement with Endeavor Energy Resources. Through its XTO Energy subsidiary, XOM will fund development to gain substantial operating equity in ~34K gross acres in Texas' Wolfcamp formation in an agreement which increases XTO's holdings in the Permian Basin to more than 1.5M net acres. In a separate deal, Aubrey McClendon's American Energy acquires ~30K net acres of XOM's Utica shale leasehold in Ohio which XTO will continue to operate in a core area of ~55K net acres and use proceeds to fund all near-term development costs. |Feb. 3, 2014, 10:10 AM|Imperial Oil +2.2% on Barron's report highlighting strong output growth

 Imperial Oil (IMO +2.2%) opens higher after a weekend Barron's report touts the company as a "hidden gem," overlooked by investors because it is 70% owned by Exxon Mobil (XOM) but with potential stock price appreciation on strong production growth.
IMO represents 6%-7% of XOM's production, but should account for two-thirds of its production growth over the next five years, the report says, yet the stock, which once traded at a premium to XOM shares, now trades at a slight discount.
IMO does the opposite of what others do to boost their stocks, Barron's writes: It doesn't have earnings conference calls, doesn't make many investor presentations, doesn't pay a dividend it can't afford, and exploits investment opportunities with double-digit returns. |Jan. 30, 2014, 6:41 PM|Conoco's strategy starting to pay off as bigger oil rivals struggle

 ConocoPhillips (COP) didn't shock with its Q4 results but they look great when compared with its biggest competitors as it moves to overcome the problems of high costs and  lack of fresh reserves that have nagged at Exxon (XOM) and Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B). Analysts say COP's plan to sell lower-yielding assets to focus on more profitable oil production is beginning to pay off as the industry faces pressure from shareholders to lift returns despite flat oil prices and rising costs for risky exploration work designed to replace reserves. Credit Suisse calls COP the best performing large oil company, citing 7% growth in cash flow despite asset sales, a reduced share count and more cash on the balance sheet. Meanwhile, XOM's results reflect a "mediocre quarter," especially in international production, Edward Jones says, adding XOM has already lost momentum already, reverting back to  declining production and stagnant earnings.

 BP (BP -0.4%) says production has started at the West Chirag platform of the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli field in the Azerbaijan sector of the Caspian Sea, which the company calls "a major milestone" in the development of the super-giant ACG field.
West Chirag production began from a pre-drilled well on Jan. 28 and will increase throughout this year as other pre-drilled wells are brought on line, BP says; the new platform has a capacity for 183K bbl/day with a gas export capacity of 285M cf/day.

Big oil's (XOM) push to export U.S. oil overseas is facing a new obstacle: falling gasoline prices.
A flood of new oil from Texas to the Great Plains has swamped refineries, driving down pump prices 10% since March while global oil prices  have hovered at ~$107/bbl; it suggests the world crude  market is having waning influence on U.S. gasoline, which instead is  beginning to track lower-priced domestic oil.
As cheaper oil translates to cheaper gasoline, the likes of Exxon (XOM) and Conoco (COP) will have a tougher time convincing U.S. lawmakers that ending export  restrictions would benefit the country, says RBN Energy's Sandy Fielden, since "the most obvious thing that’s going to happen [given more exports] is that crude prices will go up and so will gasoline."
Lifting strict export limits would halt the decline in U.S. crude prices  while costing motorists as much as $10B/year in higher fuel  prices, according to Barclays.

Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares have gained 8.2% during the past three months, whipping rivals Chevron (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP), but Barclays analysts think that sort of outperformance can't hold up.
The firm attributes XOM's strong showing to the Buffett effect, the stock’s safe haven status, and the expectation that production has finally bottomed with Q3 marking the inflection point towards higher growth; but due to the recently expired ADCO license in Abu Dhabi and the Dutch government’s decision last week to cut Groningen gas production due to tremor concerns, 2014 likely will result in yet another year of negative production growth.
As a result, the firm cuts its 2014 EPS forecast to $7.20 from $7.40 but still expect XOM to beat Q4 consensus forecasts of $1.92 by $0.04.

 Exxon Mobil (XOM -0.5%) is downgraded to Neutral from Buy with a $106 price target, down from $110, at BofA Merrill Lynch due to valuation and potential losses of production "largely outside of XOM's control" at Groningen and UAE. The combined loss of ~190K boe/day essentially wipes out planned growth of ~4% in 2014; while the impact on earnings is modest, reassessing XOM's broader portfolio leads the firm to raise the issue of a potentially higher government take at XOM's RasGas development as a consequence of higher oil prices in recent years.

Operators of Kazakhstan's huge Kashagan oil field reportedly are considering a temporary solution to resume output, halted indefinitely since mid-October after a series of dangerous gas leaks.
Exxon Mobil (XOM), Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) and other members of the NCOC consortium are looking into a makeshift solution that would involve re-injecting the gas into the ground; although it could take several months to install the necessary compressors at the $50B project, the plan would help NCOC to minimize revenue losses while figuring out a permanent solution.
The consortium had planned to rely on gas re-injection - often used in the industry to manage pressure inside underground reservoirs and enhance oil recovery - only in a later stage of the Kashagan project.

Alaska plans to jump-start a $45B natural gas export project by pitching in more than 10% of the cost and joining Exxon Mobil (XOM), BP, ConocoPhillips (COP) and TransCanada (TRP) as an equity partner.
The agreement between the state and the four companies outlines a framework in which Alaska would take as much as a 25% stake in a proposed gas processing plant, an 800-mile pipeline from the North Slope and a liquefaction facility in the Kenai Peninsula.
The state would pay as much as $5.75B for its share of the $23B liquefaction facility, which would be capable of shipping 18M metric tons/year of liquefied natural gas; the producers would pay the remaining portion of the $45B total project cost.
Alaska Gov. Parnell has asked the state's legislature to approve the deal and give state agencies the ability to negotiate shipping and leasing arrangements.

Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) and Gazprom Neft (OGZPY, GZPFY) begin a drilling campaign to assess the potential of Siberia’s Bazhenov formation, likely one of the world’s largest deposits of shale oil.
The venture between the two companies has started drilling the first of five horizontal wells over the next two years following three years of study on the prospect.
The Bazhenov layer, which underlies Siberia’s existing oil fields, has attracted Shell and Exxon (XOM) because it is similar to the Bakken shale in the U.S.; XOM will start a $300M pilot project drilling in a different part of the Bazhenov with Rosneft this year.

The U.S. will be energy secure by the end of the decade, Exxon Mobil (XOM) CEO Rex Tillerson tells CNBC: "We're already the  world's largest natural gas producer [and] last year crude oil production  surpassed levels not seen since the 1980s."
According to Tillerson, China’s shale reserves likely are larger than those in the  U.S. but are difficult to develop; most are buried much deeper than in North  America, and many are in remote areas where  there is little infrastructure to support their development.
XOM has partnered with a state oil firm to study to  test shale potential in China, but Tillerson says it is in  the early stages of evaluation.

 Chevron's (CVX -1.9%) earnings guidance isn't impressing investors; it expects Q4 profit to be "comparable" with Q3 when it posted net income of $4.95B, but analyst consensus had estimated Q4 to come in at $5.69B. Unlike last year, when CVX’s refining business was a drag on earnings while its upstream business was strong, now refining is providing the boost - good news for Exxon Mobil (XOM +0.1%) and refiners, Morgan Stanley says. MS thinks most U.S. refiners will show a Q/Q improvement in capture rates, helping XOM more than CVX due to its significantly more absolute North American refining capacity; marketing margins also are improving sharply, a positive indicator for refiners with retail operations such as Marathon Petroleum (MPC), Tesoro (TSO), Phillips 66 (PSX), Western Refining (WNR) and Delek US (DK). |Jan. 9, 2014, 11:34 AM|Exxon looks fully valued, Citigroup says as it downgrades shares

 Exxon Mobil (XOM -1.1%) has gained 14% in the past 12 months, and the strong performance prompts Citigroup’s Faisel Kahn to downgrade shares to Neutral from Buy. XOM has been rising on expectations for a recovery from a difficult year for production and a record level of refining maintenance that weighed on 2013 earnings, but the firm believes this is now largely priced into the stock. However, Citi raises its price targets for XOM, Chevron (CVX -0.7%), ConocoPhillips (COP +0.1%) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY -0.2%) largely based on a reduction of its cost of capital assumptions and the approaching start-up of many large scale upstream projects. |Jan. 8, 2014, 4:49 PM|Abu Dhabi to operate main onshore oil fields alone

 Exxon Mobil (XOM) is moving to capitalize on growing demand in Asia by announcing the expansion of its chemical production facility in Singapore, where new technology will enable it to process crude oil directly into  petrochemical products. XOM declines to put a price on the facility but industry analysts see the move as an ambitious bet on new technology at a time of industry  overcapacity. Two-thirds of the world's growth in chemical demand will occur in the Asia-Pacific region, CEO Rex Tillerson says. The new technology used at the facility can take certain  kinds of crude oil as feedstock for the cracking process without the need for prior refining, which will lowers feedstock costs, saving energy and reducing emissions. |Jan. 7, 2014, 5:23 PM|Gasoline, diesel futures rise as cold causes refinery shutdowns

 The giant Kashagan oil field, which was brought to a halt by leaks shortly after start-up last year, is grappling with a bureaucratic "nightmare" on top of its engineering troubles as it strives for commercial production in 2014, according to a Reuters report.
The scale and complexity of the project, which has cost ~$50B so far, led its partners - which include Exxon (XOM), Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), Total (TOT) and Eni (E) - away from the traditional single operator command-and-control model, where one of the larger companies takes charge while others provide support and share risks, costs and rewards.
Commercial production could still be many months away, and engineering difficulties have exposed the weaknesses of the cumbersome administrative structure, which will stay in place until oil is flowing properly.

It’s been a fine year for Exxon Mobil (XOM +0.6%), with shares recently hitting 15-month highs and rising 16.5% YTD; a post-Christmas push looks to be a response to XOM’s announced joint venture with Russia's Rosneft (RNFTF) to launch a pilot program to drill horizontal wells and revive old wells in western Siberia. XOM is one of the cheapest Dow stocks and while its earnings and revenues dropped this year, it still managed to outperform the industry average.

 Energy stocks have underperformed this year, but Merrill Lynch analysts are reasonably positive on the sector for 2014, pointing to some key themes: With the price of gas likely to remain in a narrow range next year, the firm says investors should buy high-quality, large resource-based stocks such as COG and RRC. The net asset value race is over, and the coming year is about execution, ML says, seeing PXD and WLL as winners here. Following 2013's wave of activism, the firm sees gains in HES and OXY. Favorable outlooks for E&P budgets could lift oilfield services stocks focused on North America, such as HAL and SLB. The ML team sees crude production rising to the highest level since 1989, and pinpoints TSO and VLO as the refiners to benefit the most in 2014 because they're crude-advantaged and have stock-specific catalysts. Finally, the firm suggests investors with significant gains in CVX may want to take those and buy XOM for 2014.

Anadarko Petroleum's (APC) legal troubles likely haven't tarnished its allure for investors - instead, it has helped make APC $9B cheaper, and more appealing for a buyout, Bloomberg reports.
APC may be at the top of the list for multinational oil companies seeking purchases to turn around declining production, analysts say; a buyer willing to shell out $40B plus a premium would get a presence in fields where few big energy companies have exposure: the Niobrara formation in Colorado, Texas’ Eagle Ford shale basin, and offshore Africa.
APC would be an especially good fit for Exxon (XOM) or Chevron (CVX), Oppenheimer's Fadel Gheit says, although it's hard to see how a deal could be serious without a resolution to the Tronox lawsuit, which could leave APC on the hook for as much as $14B in environmental cleanup and health claims.

Keen competition is expected for the frontier tracts which cover  nearly 50K sq. km and estimated to hold potential resources of 31B boe; bidders believed to be in contention include BP, Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B),  Chevron (CVX) and Statoil (STO), but XOM apparently will not participate.
Despite the resource promise, the Greenland blocks would require spending of ~$500M on seismic surveys  and drilling of up to two exploration wells.
|Dec. 12, 2013, 12:19 PM|U.S. should lift domestic oil export restrictions, Exxon says

 Exxon's (XOM) annual energy outlook this year has a stark message: We are entering an era of abundance, and it’s time the U.S. started exporting oil.
"We are not dealing with an era of scarcity" as was the case during the 1973 Arab oil embargo when the U.S. imposed restrictions on exporting domestic oil; "we need to rethink the regulatory scheme and the statutory scheme on the books." XOM is increasingly optimistic about how much oil can be recovered with today’s technology, predicting 65% of the world’s crude will be untapped by 2040. XOM forecasts global demand for gas will rise by 65% by 2040, with natural gas on track to supply 25% of global energy requirements; demand for coal will rise until 2025, but coal’s share of the global energy mix will fall from 25% today to below 20%.

 Tucked away inside Chevron's (CVX -0.6%) announced $39.8B 2014 capex budget is another cost blowout on the development of its Gorgon LNG project in Australia: The latest estimated cost is $54B, vs. a $52B estimate offered a year ago and $37B when the final investment decision was taken in 2009. The timetable for first gas from Gorgon, which will have the capacity to produce 15.6M metric tons/year, slips to Q1 2015 from the original 2014 target. CVX says the project's economics remain attractive, following a sharp increase in oil prices since construction began; Gorgon's Asian customers are locked into contracts typically lasting 20 years that are linked to the fluctuating price of oil. Operator CVX owns 47.3% of Gorgon, while Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) each hold 25%. |Dec. 9, 2013, 6:30 PM|U.S. seen becoming net chemical exporter, thanks to shale boom


The U.S. is poised to become a net exporter of chemicals thanks to the shale oil boom, FT reports; the American Chemistry Council forecasts net U.S. chemical exports of  ~$2.7B this year and expects exports to rise 45% over the next five  years to nearly $30B by 2018.
U.S. companies such as Exxon Mobil (XOM), Dow Chemical (DOW), Chevron (CVX) and Phillips 66 (PSX) are among the leaders in investing in new capacity, but even producers from Asia and the Middle East are looking at projects in the U.S.
Dow's Andrew Liveris speaks for big companies that want curbs on U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas to ensure their energy cost advantage; with five LNG projects now approved for export sales by the Obama administration, "where they are right now seems to be fine," he says.

BofA Merrill Lynch is a more cautious buyer of stocks after this year's gains, and its top 10 large-cap stocks to buy for 2014 are mostly under-owned and unloved on Wall Street: ADM, Caterpillar (CAT), CenturyLink (CTL), Citigroup (C), Cisco (CSCO), DaVita (DVA), Exxon (XOM), GM, NextEra Energy (NEE) and Nucor (NUE).
On CAT, the Lynch analysts point to high foreign sales prospects for 2014, and see strength in energy-related profits offsetting weakness in global mining; the firm has a $100 price target vs. ~$90 consensus.
XOM is considered inexpensive compared to many large-cap energy names, it is expected to continue its large share buyback program and should increase the dividend; Lynch's target is $110 vs. $96 consensus.
NUE is the ultimate contrarian play, as Wall Street is underwhelmed by steel stocks, but Lynch sees a rebound in commercial building as a big boost for 2014 earnings; the firm has a $60 target vs. $55 consensus.

 Eni (E) CEO Paolo Scaroni doesn't expect the temporary stoppage of output at the giant Kashagan oil field to run into 2015, even as the consortium that runs it carries out tests after natural gas leaks. A prolonged halt at Kashagan, which has been plagued by years of delays and cost overruns, could be a drag on the finances of the consortium behind the project, which includes Eni, Exxon Mobil (XOM), Total (TOT) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B).
Scaroni also says Italy could produce up to 20% of its oil needs, but blames Italy's environmental regulations; he says that adopting regulations like those in force in Norway or the U.K. would allow Italy to double its domestic oil production.

 Exxon Mobil (XOM -0.4%) is downgraded to Outperform from Strong Buy at Raymond James, which expects a more limited upside for shares after rising 10% so far in Q4.
The firm says the tactical rating change should not obscure its fundamentally constructive outlook on XOM in  the context of its below consensus 2014 oil price forecast ($95/bbl for Brent, $83 for WTI).
Although some of the easy money has been made, the firm thinks XOM is set to generate at least as much free cash flow in 2014 as in 2013, despite its lower oil price outlook and without  allowing for any spending reductions. |Dec. 5, 2013, 8:38 AM|NYT: Big companies prepared to pay a price for carbon

 More than two dozen of the biggest U.S. corporations, including the five major oil companies - Exxon (XOM), ConocoPhillips (COP), Chevron (CVX), BP and Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) are planning their future growth on the expectation that the  government will force them to pay a price for carbon pollution as a way to control global warming, NYT reports.
Both supporters and opponents of action to fight global warming say the  development is significant because businesses that chart a financial  course to make money in a carbon-constrained future could be more  inclined to support policies that address climate change.

 “When Warren Buffett gives his seal of approval to any company, that is never a bad thing,” so Exxon Mobil (XOM +1.8%) powers within reach of its 52-week high after Berkshire Hathaway added a 40M-share position. But Buffett's style of value investing may not work so well for the rest of us, even for those looking for a big defensive energy stock; Brian Youngberg of Edward Jones prefers Chevron (CVX +0.2%), which he says is more attractively priced relative to XOM, offers a higher dividend yield, is more profitable per barrel, and has better potential for production volume growth. Buffett's underpinning thesis for XOM purchase looks similar to his 2011 IBM purchase - difficulty growing revenues but returning a significant amount of cash to shareholders - but investors who blindly followed Buffett into Big Blue in 2011 have significantly underperformed.

 Is lumbering Exxon Mobil (XOM) finally turning around? Argus Research upgrades shares to Buy from Hold with a $104 target price, believing Q3 will mark the low point in XOM’s near-term results. XOM has an exceptionally strong financial position, the firm says, and despite heavy  exposure to natural gas (45% of Q3 production), XOM’s operating margins  are well above the average for large integrated firms and second only to Chevron (CVX) among the super majors. XOM shares are trading at a premium to peers, but the firm thinks the premium is warranted given the  company’s low debt, strong cash flow and healthy operating margins. 24/7's Jon Ogg thinks Chevron priced at less than 11x forward earnings looks even more appealing than Exxon's 12.9x.

 The Permian Basin is all the rage on Wall Street, but oil prices need to stay high enough to support the current rate of exploratory drilling - and prices for West Texas crude have dropped below $100/bbl for a third straight weekly decline. The Permian remains the largest U.S. oil producer, with output averaging ~1.3M bbl/day and rising, but it's also the most expensive U.S. shale formation in which to drill - meaning the boom could become a bust if crude moves near $70/bbl, as some analysts predict. If oil drops to $80, wells in some parts of  the Permian will become  money-losers; wells drilled in the Cline Shale and Northern Mississippian Lime  layers of the Permian need $96 oil to break even.

 The big North American integrated oil companies will begin releasing quarterly results later this week, and J.P. Morgan's energy research team forecasts earnings increases of 8% Q/Q and 9% Y/Y, remaining very positive on the sector even as crude oil prices drop below $100/bbl. The firm considers ConocoPhillips (COP) a top name to buy and a great total return play for investors, and it likes Hess (HES), Marathon Oil (MRO), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Suncor (SU) and Cenovus (CVE); it's much less excited about Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX).

 ExxonMobil (XOM) confirms it shut down an oil pipeline system at the Port of Long Beach, Calif., yesterday after discovering a crude leak in the area. The THUMS pipeline, which delivers crude oil produced in Long Beach Harbor to XOM's refinery in Torrance, Calif., and can process up to 155K bbl/day of crude, was taken offline as a precaution. XOM says the oil has been contained but does not say how much oil was released.

A rare “three white soldiers” chart pattern may foreshadow future gains for Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares, Miller Tabak analysts say; if the pattern appears after lows or a spell of stable prices, it’s a sign of strength ahead, according to technical analysts.
“The bull should be able to take this and run back up to the $90 level,  where we will have to evaluate any reaction to overhead supply,” the firm says.
To help matters, November is traditionally a good month for XOM stock, averaging 2.8% gains during the past 10 years.

 The downside of the U.S. natural gas boom is that, at historically low prices   of ~$3.75/MMBtu, "some of the  levered players are struggling to cover their debt service and their  obligations to drill more holes under their leases," Jim Chanos tells CNBC. The boom in nat gas supplies, and the subsequent low prices, is "bad  news for global coal as more and more countries switch over to natural  gas," he adds. Chanos is short two different groups of the major oil companies: the big publicly traded majors like Exxon (XOM) - "their problem is finding costs" in reserves like deepwater drilling and the Arctic - and the nationalized companies such as Petrobras (PBR), Ecopetrol (EC) and PetroChina (PTR), which he says really are "political venues."

 In a Total-Exxon showdown, Morgan Stanley says Total (TOT +1.4%) is starting to benefit from high investments, translating into stronger growth in operating cash flows than most other big oil companies, and enjoys a strong outlook for operating cash flow combined with plans to reduce capex after this year. In contrast, Stanley says Exxon Mobil’s (XOM -0.1%) operating cash flow suffers from an upstream portfolio with relatively few startups and weak ramp-ups; with such a weak growth outlook, XOM could decide to  add additional projects or go for a large acquisition, creating capex risks. Meanwhile, Chevron (CVX -0.6%) is one of the firm's top picks, with higher production growth and improving returns in the next five years driving share outperformance. |Oct. 10, 2013, 2:09 AM|Libyan PM kidnapped

 Both critics and supporters of the new EPA draft regulations on CO2 emissions agree on one thing: This will be the final blow to many proposed coal plants. The truth is, U.S. coal generation already was in decline not because of climate regulations, but because of good ol' free-market capitalism; the boom in natural gas production has dramatically increased  supplies, sent prices plummeting and prompted a shift away from coal. Among potential long-term winners: U.S. nat gas drillers such as CHK and XOM, drilling services firms such as HAL and BHI, pipeline companies such as SE and KMI, makers of gas-fired turbines such as GE  and SI, power generators such as NRG and  CPN if electricity prices rise. Likely losers: Coal appears headed for a decline, and companies with large Appalachian operations such as JRCC and ANR could suffer most as more coal comes from cheaper-to-access deposits in the Illinois Basin and Wyoming; big industrial companies, which have used low U.S. power prices as a competitive advantage, are concerned.

Refiners are at a disadvantage as oil prices rise and better off when prices fall, so UBS would focus on other areas for now.

 Apache (APA +9.2%) may have "knocked it out of the park" with its sale of a third of its Egypt oil and gas assets to Sinopec (SNP -1.2%) for $3.1B (I, II), but the reaction toward SNP is more ambiguous. The deal, China's biggest investment in the Middle East to date, shows a continued global search for energy and resources to feed an economy growing at a 7%-plus annual rate and a higher tolerance for risk than its western counterparts; note that PetroChina (PTR) reportedly is in talks to acquire 25% of Exxon's (XOM) West Qurna-1 oilfield in Iraq. The deal also could provide a boost for other energy producers  with significant operations in the region; Occidental Petroleum (OXY -0.2%) produces ~37% of its total output in the Middle East and North Africa, and is thought to be looking to sell all or part of those  assets. |Aug. 29, 2013, 12:44 PM|Energy stocks slide after two-day rally as oil prices drop

High development costs - including the billions needed to fund drilling  programs, new export terminals and thousands of miles of pipe across the wilderness - make discount sales of Canadian liquefied natural gas “difficult to financially justify," the International Gas Union says in a new report.
West coast LNG projects proposed by Chevron (CVX),  Exxon Mobil (XOM) and others may struggle to meet demands by overseas buyers for sales volumes linked  to low North American gas prices instead of higher Asian prices, the report says.
CVX, for one, has balked at demands  for discount sales from its 5M metric tons/year Kitimat, B.C.,  LNG proposal, arguing higher prices are needed to justify the huge capex involved in building export infrastructure.

 Nigeria risks losing $185B within 10 years and oil production may slump by 25% from 2.4M bbl/day as higher taxes proposed by a new law will deter investment in the country’s oil industry, according to the managing director of Exxon Mobil’s (XOM +0.7%) Nigerian unit.
The new law aims to increase the government’s share of profit from oil pumped to at least 73% from 61% currently. XOM, Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), Chevron (CVX), Total (TOT) and Eni (E) combined pump ~90% of Nigeria’s oil through ventures with the state-owned oil company; the group says proposed increased taxes in the legislation would make exploration "uneconomical." |Aug. 22, 2013, 12:10 PM|China, Indonesia to join Exxon in developing giant Iraq oilfield

Various scenarios for farming out XOM's 60% stake are still under discussion, but PetroChina (PTR -0.3%) looks ready to take 25% and Indonesia's state-owned Pertamina 10%; XOM would remain operator but its share could be cut to 25%, and Royal  Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B) would retain its existing 15%. China already is the top foreign player in Iraq's oilfields and such a big stake in West Qurna-1 would make PTR the single biggest foreign investor in Iraqi oil. |Aug. 21, 2013, 2:59 PM|Sales of both puts and calls can boost Exxon investor returns in weak spell


For those who don't own beaten-down Exxon Mobil (XOM) and want to buy it at depressed levels, Barron's Steven Sears suggests selling puts to take advantage of elevated volatility; for those who already own the stock, he says to consider writing calls to increase returns and hedge against potential additional declines.
XOM's options trading patterns suggest traders are short  calls anticipating the stock does not advance, and long puts in  anticipation of a decline.
XOM's implied volatility is  unusually high, reflecting the stock's decline and the interest  among hedge funds in exploiting the stock's weakness.

Exxon Mobil (XOM) completed its 18th loss in 19 sessions and have been one the bigger burdens on the broader market considering the company’s weight among the DJIA.

Another headwind to XOM’s tough time meeting forecasts, Oppenheimer says: shrinking buybacks.

Share buybacks totaled more than $210B in the last 10 years but declined from $5B in Q1 to $4B in Q2 and $3B planned for Q3, with further declines anticipated due  to declining free cash flow.

 U.S. pipeline operators have a problem - finding cracks before they rupture and turn into oil spills. The "number one asset," a torpedo-like robot called a "smart pig," can't always spot the fissures, or the data collected can take months to analyze. A case in point came when Exxon Mobil (XOM) inspected a pipeline in Arkansas in February using a smart pig, only for the line to split open a month later and spill 5,000 barrels of crude. The device didn't find the minute cracks along the seam of the pipe that caused the burst. The boom in U.S. oil output is straining the country's 184,000 miles of pipeline, with the volume of spillages jumping by 77% so far this year to 93,000 barrels.

Mexico is set to end a seven-decade state oil monopoly and open the door to greater involvement by foreign companies, but it remains to be seen if the plan is liberal enough to attract the likes of BP, Exxon (XOM) or Chevron (CVX).

It's not privatization: Mexico (EWW) will keep ownership of reserves and share profits with oil companies that find and produce the oil - a big change from the past, where Pemex only paid companies a fee for contract work, but it falls short of sharing the oil itself, which many oil companies wanted.
The country clearly needs reform; it sits on a reserve the size of Kuwait yet is a net importer from chronic lack of investment.

After four straight down sessions, crude futures are up, +1.9% to $75.05.          |Aug. 25, 2010, 3:49 PM|Investors should buy large-cap, dividend-paying stocks like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) rather than settle for paltry yields from Treasurys and municipal bonds, Loews (L) CEO James Tisch says. “Who would have thought five or 10 years ago that a 3% yield on a stock would be a good yield? But today it’s a very good yield."          |Aug. 20, 2010, 12:45 PM|Pemex, the largest oil producer in Latin America, expects to call on Exxon Mobil (XOM), Shell (RDS.A) and Chevron (CVX) for the first time to help explore the Gulf of Mexico.

The meeting has been lengthened to address the future of BP (BP). Advisors are encouraging him to make a preemptive offer using ExxonMobil's more highly rated paper, and exploit the stubborn rating differential that persisted. |Jun. 29, 2010, 8:02 AM|A JV between BP (BP +0.1%) and ConocoPhillips (COP), which plans to build a massive natural gas pipeline from Alaska, is said to be in early talks to join a competing $36B project by TransCanada (TRP) and Exxon Mobil (XOM -0.9%). TransCanada denies talks are underway to merge the pipeline projects. |Jun. 25, 2010, 1:25 PM|A recent decision by a World Bank-affiliated arbitration panel gives ExxonMobil (XOM) a leg up in its efforts to extract compensation from Venezuela, despite Hugo Chavez's sabre-rattling. The ruling allows XOM to move ahead with its claim to be paid for oil-producing assets, estimated to be worth billions of dollars, and bodes well for other firms pursuing similar claims. |Jun. 24, 2010, 8:47 AM|It may be too little, too late to help BP's (BP) public image, but it turns out that BP and other oil majors based their response plans to a potential Gulf spill on government data that was faulty; government models had put very low odds on oil hitting shore, even in a spill much bigger than the current one.          |Jun. 20, 2010, 4:04 PM|“The BP oil spill has laid bare fundamental shortcomings in the oil and gas industry’s ability to prevent and stop catastrophic blowouts,” says Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, and offshore drillers will now have to provide well-blowout scenarios when applying for permits. |Jun. 15, 2010, 12:14 PM|As executives from Exxon Mobil (XOM +1%), ConocoPhillips (COP +2%), Chevron (CVX +0.8%) and Shell (RDS.A +2.7%) maintain they can drill in deep water safely, House lawmakers criticize them for inadequate disaster-recovery plans that are a "carbon copy" of BP's (BP +3.8%).

Rallies in oil and metals drove up producers such as Exxon Mobil (XOM +3.3%) and Alcoa (AA +2.4%), boosting the Dow. The broader market remained weak, with NYSE declining issues leading advancers by about three to two.          |Jun. 8, 2010, 2:21 PM|The idea that BP (BP) might actually file for bankruptcy, particularly as part of a merger that would enable it to cordon off its liabilities from the spill, is starting to percolate on Wall Street. Given that Shell (RDS.A) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) have billions in cash on hand and market values that easily exceed BP, now would be the time to make a deal.          |May 28, 2010, 4:15 AM|Shell's (RDS.A) acquisition of East Resources is the second-biggest oil and gas deal this year, after BP's (BP) acquisition of deepwater assets from Devon Energy (DVN) for $7B in March.

Success "would be a major positive catalyst, stemming flow to less than 100M barrels - still huge but only just over a third the size of Exxon (XOM) Valdez," he writes. "It would also do much to restore BP in the public mind as a company who has developed the solution, not caused the problem." |May 2, 2010, 12:58 PM|If state and local officials are starting to feel desperate about the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, BP (BP) is already in full-blown panic.

The deal is thought to be worth at least $4B. WSJ reported earlier that CNOOC (CEO) was in advanced JV talks with Ghana National Petroleum to pitch a rival bid.          |Oct. 7, 2009, 9:52 AM|Sources say ExxonMobil (XOM) has agreed to pay $4B for a minority stake in a oil field off the coast of Ghana.

A direct sale by the government would be highly disruptive to the block, of which Western majors (RDS.A, CVX, XOM, COP, TOT, ENI) already own 50%. And if CNOOC is planning to turn directly to its rivals, what might they be willing to sell?          |Sep. 29, 2009, 7:35 AM|Sources say Chinese state-owned oil company CNOOC (CEO) is in talks with Nigeria to buy a large stake in some of Africa's richest oil blocks, at a possible value of $30B.
