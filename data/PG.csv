The FDA has updated and modernized the Nutrition Facts labeling on packaged foods and beverages with the aim of better informing consumers about food choices that support a healthy diet.Key changes:Serving size and number of servings per container are more prominently displayed. Serving size updated to reflect what people actually eat and drink (as compared to the mouse-sized portions previously listed).The daily values for nutrients updated based on new scientific evidence. The daily values reflect amounts to consume or not to exceed. Data for %Daily Value make it easier for consumers to determine how much a nutrient in a serving contributes to a daily diet.Added sugars are now required on the label. Vitamin D and potassium are also required because many consumers fall short of the recommended amounts. Vitamins A & C are no longer required since deficiencies in these vitamins are rare today.Larger manufacturers have until July 26, 2018 to institute the new labeling requirements. Small businesses have an additional year to comply.Related tickers: (XLP)(VDC -0.1%)(FXG -0.6%)(IYK)(PBJ -0.6%)(PSCC -0.7%)(OTCPK:NSRGY -0.4%)(PG -0.2%)(UL -0.2%)(PEP +0.3%)(KO +0.3%)(GIS -0.1%)|Thu, Mar. 2, 8:56 AM|Invesco Diversified Dividend Fund A (LCEAX) February Summary

Facebook (FB +0.1%) spending will not be cut, though targeted ads will only be deployed on an as-determined basis going forward. The company additionally plans to cut back advertising on lesser-reach digital properties.
The news comes as Facebook earlier today introduced improved ad-control customization and ad-blocking initiatives.
Targeted advertising is a distinct and major feature of Facebook's revenue model and with this new approach by a major global partner, it will be interesting to see if others begin to adopt comparably more broad-based strategies.
Nonetheless, Facebook is adept at building profitable advertising structures for large and small companies alike and while this slight pushback is notable, the company will look to address these concerns and adjust accordingly.

The investment firm does a silver lining for the global razor business. "We believe increased category awareness through Unilever’'s efforts with DSC, particularly in developing markets, could help improve global category growth," notes analyst Mark Astrachan.

 Unilever (UL, UN) confirms it acquired Dollar Shave Club. The company didn't disclose the transaction price, but earlier reports pegged it at $1B which would make the deal the third largest buyout in the e-commerce space ever after Zulilly and Wayfair. The transaction is also an exclamation point on the disruption that Dollar Shave Club achieved in a consumer products category once considered nearly impenetrable. The innovative shaving club sends razors directly to members for as little as $1 per month. Dollar Shave Club is on track to top $200M in turnover this year and has 3.2M members. Earlier this week, news broke that Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is increasing its testing of online subscriptions. It's a trend to watch for Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL), Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB), and Edgewell Personal Care (NYSE:EPC).

Wal-Mart sells about $10.8B worth of P&G products in a year. |Jun. 8, 2016, 3:32 PM|Rivals snipe at Procter & Gamble over Tide Pod usage advice

 Procter & Gamble (PG +0.4%) is accused by some peers of attempting to boost sales by recommending that customers use more Tide Pods detergent packets per wash. The company recommends three for a larger load, compared to the two most rivals suggest. P&G was one of the first to launch a concentrated laundry detergent product when Tide Pods was created in 2012, but now faces rivals such as Sun Products' All Mighty Pacs and Church & Dwight's Arm & Hammer Power Paks.
Execs with the consumer products giants note that washing machines are bigger now than when Tide Pods was first introduced. |Jun. 1, 2016, 4:18 PM|Procter & Gamble CEO Taylor to add on chairman's role

Laslzo Birinyi still sees underlying strength in the stock market, despite the myriad of economic, technical, and political fears holding back investor enthusiasm.
In particular, the well-known investor has his eyes on AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) and builder NVR (NYSE:NVR) as "special situations" stocks.
Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) also makes the list due to its lack of volatility amid a volatile market which could indicate upside down the road. On that point, a quick screen of other consumer goods stocks like Kraft that have weathered the uneven read on U.S. consumer spending and global demand over the last month may tip off some other value picks.

Though  Amazon diaper products will only be sold to Prime subscribers in the initial phase, analysts have warned on some pricing pressure for the consumer products giants if the initiative from the Seattle e-commerce giant is rolled out at scale.

 Economists think that the combination of a stronger U.S. jobs environment and sub-$2 gas prices could improve some consumer spending habits, although not as much for traditional big box retailers, apparel chains, and electronics stores as for specialty retailers selling lower-end personal care, housing, and decor items. Though middle-income and low-income consumers continue to be thrifty with major purchases (logo apparel, gadgets), there have been signs in recent earnings reports of strength in everyday items such as shampoo, mattresses, and underwear. That trend could benefit a variety of chain stores with an U.S. focus including Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE), Ulta Salon (NASDAQ:ULTA), TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX), Dollar General (NYSE:DG), Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST), Kirkland's (NASDAQ:KIRK), Sally Beauty Holdings (NYSE:SBH), Michaels Companies (NASDAQ:MIK), Party City (NYSE:PRTY), and even Mattress Firm (NASDAQ:MFRM).

 Execs with Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) were on the defensive during the firm's earnings call as they described the "tough sledding" they see ahead for the consumer products company. Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj in particular hammered the P&G team over top-line growth and wanted to know why a major breakup didn't make sense.

PG is down 3.6% and stands near sessions lows.
The company is the largest holding in the Consumer Staples Select ETF (XLP -0.3%) with a 12.1% index weight.
