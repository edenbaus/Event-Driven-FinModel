Analyst Steve Milunovich: "Management has emphasized the importance of services the past year. We consider the installed base and retention rate the primary drivers of device and services value. We also view Apple as a platform vendor with hardware and services intertwined. However, to test the notion that the market underappreciates services, we performed a sum-of-the-parts analysis. If Apple services were valued similarly to PayPal, the stock would be at least 10% higher." Price target $138 (current price $133.64).A strengthening component of Apple's (AAPL +1.2%) business, Services is projected (by Apple) to represent the size of Fortune 100 this year and is targeted to double in size over the next four.Previously (February 10, 2017): Bernstein reiterates Apple at Outperform, addresses Services|Mon, Feb. 13, 8:27 AM|Apple target raised to $150 at Goldman Sachs

Noting Apple's Services segment at 11% ($24B) of overall revenue and its 22% growth rate last year (N.B. iPhone install base +18%), analyst Toni Sacconaghi considers the company's target of doubling that business in the next four years aggressive and requiring the addition of new services and prospectively major inorganic contribution.Further: "Another way to look at Apple’s bogey is that it is targeting $24B in annual services revenues additions over the next four years. If ARPU grows by 4%+ annually during the period or 20% over the 4 years (which may be aggressive, given history), and, per our model, the installed base grows by 27% over the entire 4-year period, Apple will need to find an additional $13B in revenues over the next 4 years to hit its target – which appears highly unlikely on an organic basis. To put this in perspective, Netflix ended 2016 with 99 million total subscribers and full-year revenues of almost $9B. So even buying Netflix – or recreating a Netflix with its own content offerings – may not get Apple to its bogey."Views expanding appeal and user experience of the App Store as a major opportunity for the unit.While Services represents a strong growth prospect, expects near-term to remain primarily molded by iPhone.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) price target $140 (current price $132.25, -0.13%).Previously (January 13, 2017): Bernstein's Toni Sacconaghi bullish on forthcoming iPhone cycle, unclear longer term|Fri, Feb. 10, 8:23 AM|Think big: Tesla, Netflix, Disney possible Apple targets - Baird

We believe these trends enabled the iPhone installed base to exceed 570M exiting C2016 driving record December quarter services revenue. We also believe the impressive installed base should drive strong iPhone replacement sales and earnings, as well as cash flow generation to fund strong long-term capital returns. While we anticipate a stronger upgrade cycle in C2018 with the 10-year anniversary iPhone 8, our surveys indicate solid iPhone 7 demand that should bridge the gap until a new form factor iPhone is likely released in September.

 Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz downgrades Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Equalweight from Overweight, and lowers his price-target to $117 from $119 (yesterday's close $120.08).

We also are concerned about China and India not emerging as growth catalysts in the next 12 months.

With the FTC and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) levying several charges against Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) last week, the latter's complaint is compounding unease as direct impact to Qualcomm's business model is being weighed.Bernstein's Stacy Rasgon (reducing Qualcomm target from $80 to $65): "While the $1 (billion) is what captured most of the headlines, in our opinion it is a sideshow. Rather, AAPL is attempting a direct assault on Qualcomm's basic licensing business model, attacking the 'essential' nature of their IP, and directly targeting QCOM's device-level royalty model. The suit doesn't read well for the future of the chipset relationship either."As numerous other analysts recalculate lower and Qualcomm shares trade starkly in decline following Apple's suit filed late Friday, the combination of developments has contributed to a broad sense these claims may carry greater merit than the FTC complaint alone and signal prospectively increased economic risk to Qualcomm's business with Apple going forward.Related (January 17, 2017): Qualcomm disputes FTC complaintRelated (January 23, 2017): Qualcomm disputes Apple's patent royalties charge|Mon, Jan. 23, 8:23 AM|Qualcomm disputes Apple's patent royalties charge

The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations. Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy, standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties.

 AT&T's (T -3%) interest in Time Warner (TWX +7.8%) progressed quickly from "had talks" to "advanced talks" and now a deal could be set by Monday -- which Bloomberg says is due to a sped-up timetable caused by Bloomberg's initial report. That's because AT&T is said to be concerned that the publicity could allow other interested suitors like Apple (AAPL -0.4%) or Alphabet (GOOG +0.3%, GOOGL +0.3%) to jump in -- and indeed Apple is said to be monitoring the deal talks, after it made its own approach to Time Warner a few months ago, The Wall Street Journal reports. Those talks involved execs under Apple chief Tim Cook and didn't get beyond a preliminary stage. A source tells the WSJ that Google doesn't look interested in an offer for Time Warner. But the story of the deal points out just how much behind-the-scenes strategic talk is going on in the media/telecom spaces, as companies vie to be among the new leaders in an upended, converged digital media climate. Sumner Redstone was said to be considering not only the merger of CBS (CBS +2.1%) and Viacom (VIA +2.7%, VIAB +2.8%) that he's already pushing for, but also to combine that entity with Time Warner.

 The focus on Apple's (AAPL -0.2%) influence in the automobile sector has shifted away from straight manufacturing to ways the tech company could integrate software, information systems, or automated driving capabilities into next-gen models. The recent developments with Project Titan also raise the stakes on which automakers strike a significant partnership with Apple if the venture makes it past 2017 (the reported AAPL deadline). While many auto industry watchers think major automakers won't convert to the Apple ecosystem across their portfolio, high-end "Applefied" models are seen as a realistic possibility. "A luxury automobile with 'Apple Inside'? That could be hit, and a profitable one yet," writes Los Angeles Times columnist Michael Hiltzik.SA contributor Bret Kenwell also dug into the Project Titan issue earlier this week.Related stocks: GM, FCAU, F, TM, HMC, OTCPK:NSANY, OTCPK:VLKAY, OTCPK:BMWYY, OTCPK:DDAIF, TSLA, OTCPK:MZDAY,  TSLA, OTC:HYMLF, OTCPK:FUJHY, RACE, TTM, MBLY.

Bank of America is not concerned regarding third-party data circulated last Friday that sent Apple (AAPL +0.2%) shares lower into the weekend.

Analyst Wamsi Mohan: "Our conversations suggest that the sellout data from a third party released Friday indicated iPhone 7/7+ sales down 25% Y/Y in International (non-North American) markets over the launch weekend." Further: "In our opinion this data is not representative of true demand. ... Apple may have allocated more supply to U.S. locations in general, and/or to its own retail stores in other countries vs. to other outlets. We would view the pullback in shares as a particularly attractive opportunity."
The bank retains a Buy rating and $125 target (current price $112.94).

Apple (AAPL -1.8%) shares were stable throughout the day, though took a sharp downward turn within the last hour on a supposed iPhone 7-related report out of market research firm GfK.

Update (3:35PM ET): GfK has confirmed existence of a report, though won't publicly disclose any of its data. From 1:30PM ET to 2:00PM ET, Apple shares dropped 2.3%. While third-party research can't offer concrete indicators of a company's performance, such reports can and do impact share price, and in this case, the report out of GfK appears clearly attributable to the sell-off.

Japanese regulators are considering taking action against Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) over possible antitrust violations that may have helped it dominate the nation's smartphone sales, a move that could hit the company's margins in one of its most profitable markets.
Japan's Fair Trade Commission said that NTT Docomo, KDDI Corp and Softbank were refusing to sell older surplus iPhone models to third party retailers due to supply agreements, thereby hobbling smaller competitors.

Stores in mainland China (36), Hong Kong (6) and Japan (7) are presently open, though an entry into South Korea would signal a more pronounced effort to compete in its smartphone market where Samsung and LG Electronics hold an estimated 80% share.

Analyst Jeffrey Kvaal maintains a Buy rating on Apple (AAPL +0.9%) while raising his target from $120 (current price $114.76).

Kvaal: "The steady positive news across geographies on the iPhone 7 launch implies demand is stronger than thought. We believe the supply chain is preparing for upward revisions to production forecasts."
Further cites aggressive carrier promotions, difficulties Samsung's having with its Galaxy Note 7 and a subscriber base 35% larger than it was for the iPhone 6.
Raises FY 2017 iPhone 7 unit estimates to 234M from 230M.
The call aligns similarly to one issued by UBS earlier in the week.

While a rumored deal with McLaren is not in the making, a New York Times write-up claims Apple (AAPL -0.9%) is in talks with Lit Motors regarding a possible acquisition. Both parties have denied comment.
Lit Motors is headquartered in San Francisco, was founded in 2010 and specializes in designing two-wheeled, gyroscopically stabilized electric vehicles.
Although a stark departure from the supercar pedigree associated with McLaren, a deal on this front could possess its own virtues. Nonetheless, a wait-and-see outlook is probably best with the high volume of rumors circulating today.

Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone margins have narrowed with the release of the iPhone 7 according to an analysis by IHS.
The all-in cost to make the iPhone 7 rises to $224.80, $36.89 higher than the iPhone 6S; both sold for $649.
All things equal, Apple still makes more margin from hardware than Samsung, but materials costs are higher than in the past, IHS noted. It has not yet done a teardown of the iPhone 7 Plus.
The base memory increase (from 16GB to 32GB) is the main source of the higher manufacturing cost.
Note that on a recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said about teardowns that he's “never seen one that is anywhere close to being accurate.”

Increases upgrade estimate to 44% from 41% and FY 2017 EPS to $9.30.

Further: "Increased procurement could reflect demand or just timing. The UBS Asia tech team's latest estimates show iPhone 7 procurement plans for F17 have increased from 80mn to 89mn, mainly due to 7 Plus needs."

He discussed the technologies this morning during an ABC News interview.

On AR: "My own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far, because this gives the capability for both of us to sit and be very present talking to each other, but also have other things visually for both of us to see. Maybe it's something we're talking about, maybe it's someone else here that is not here, present, but could be made to appear to be present with us. So there's a lot of really cool things there."

On VR: "Virtual reality sort of encloses and immerses the person into an experience that can be really cool, but probably has a lower commercial interest over time, or less people would be interested in that." He does, though, go on to note that Apple (AAPL +4.5%) has a lot of consideration for virtual reality as it relates to gaming and education.
The company had reportedly assembled a large team of specialists within the fields earlier this year.
While AR and VR initiatives have already been most notably underway at Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Facebook (FB +0.7%), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Microsoft (MSFT -0.1%) and elsewhere, efforts by Intel (INTC +0.4%), Snapchat (Private:CHAT) and Line (LN +2.1%) have developed within the last few weeks, demonstrating broad increased movement throughout the space.

With Apple being secretive about its car ambitions, the threat of disruption out of Cupertino has been somewhat of an enigmatic overhang in the industry. One thought is that Apple's $1B investment in Didi Chuxing earlier this summer may be an indication of the future direction of Apple's car strategy.

Although earlier today all iPhone 7 and 7 Plus "Jet Black" models for each carrier (AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile) displayed November-only availability, iPhone 7 options with the finish now display "3-4 weeks" timeframes. For iPhone 7 Plus, however, November remains stated.
While shipment delivery estimates for the various choices fluctuate widely (some state the on-sale date of September 16), and although Apple will not provide numbers regarding initial sales, it is notable the company has the ability to command seemingly higher demand for one model in the line by introducing a new finish.

The European Commission was said to be close to moving in the direction last month and is now expected to release reformed regulations with broader scope next week. Some of the services cited in the proposal include WhatsApp (FB -0.6%), FaceTime (AAPL -2.5%) and Skype (MSFT -0.5%), though a range of offerings would be impacted in a rules tightening.
Directives are alleged to involve reporting security breaches and maintaining backup plans along with service continuance policies.
The obligations for individual firms, however, will supposedly vary. Document: "Providers of such services should thus ensure a level of security commensurate with the degree of risk posed to the security of the communications services they provide." Further: "Therefore, whenever it is justified by the actual assessment of the security risks involved, the security requirements ... should be lighter."
Though approval by the European Parliament and European Union member states would be required to enact a proposal into law, a development this way could mark further contention between U.S.-based companies and the European Union as the heated battle between Apple and the European Commission continues and inspections into WhatsApp's updated privacy policy have recently commenced.

The company (AAPL -2.2%) has historically provided pre-order sales volume, though now considers it "no longer a representative metric" since "initial sales will be governed by supply, not demand."

Full statement to CNBC: "We expect iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be incredibly popular with customers and we are thrilled to begin taking pre-orders on September 9. Customers will receive their new iPhones starting September 16. In years past, we've announced how many new iPhones had been sold as of the first weekend following launch. But as we have expanded our distribution through carriers and resellers to hundreds of thousands of locations around the world, we are now at a point where we know before taking the first customer pre-order that we will sell out of iPhone 7. These initial sales will be governed by supply, not demand, and we have decided that it is no longer a representative metric for our investors and customers. Therefore we won't be releasing a first-weekend number any longer. We are reiterating the financial guidance for the September quarter that we provided on July 26."
Apple introduced the iPhone 7, 7 Plus, Watch Series 2 and outlined other new developments yesterday.
Q4 guidance offered in July is for $45.5B-$47.5B in revenue, 37.5%-38% gross margin and $6.05B-$6.15B of operating expenses.

Apple (AAPL -0.7%) CEO Tim Cook details the company's European origins in Cork, Ireland and writes that 60 initial employees in 1980 have now grown to 6,000 across the island.
On the European Commission: "The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple’s history in Europe, ignore Ireland’s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process." Further: "It is effectively proposing to replace Irish tax laws with a view of what the Commission thinks the law should have been."
Apple and Ireland plan to appeal the ruling, with Cook "confident that the Commission’s order will be reversed."
Though the $14.5B sum is greater than originally anticipated, the length of time expected to collect, plans to appeal, possible reductions and overall prospective impact on Apple's cash pile have kept shares predominantly intact.

EU antitrust regulators have ordered Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to pay up to €13B ($14.5B) in taxes to the Irish government after ruling that a special scheme to route profits through the country was illegal state aid.

Infringing artists' tracks are supposedly rendered more difficult to find on Spotify's (Private:MUSIC) platform and are less likely to be included in featured playlists once they become available after first being released on Apple Music (AAPL -0.5%).
The practice has reportedly been ongoing for around a year with tracks by Tidal-exclusive artists seeing similar unfavorable consideration.

 With Tim Cook set to hit his five-year anniversary as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO on Wednesday, analyses abound as to how the company has fared following his replacement of Steve Jobs. On the one hand, Apples's revenues have grown almost fourfold, net profit hit a whopping $53B last year and its market cap is $590B. However, despite the immense growth, the nagging feeling that Apple's best days are behind it seems to be increasing. Revenue has fallen for two quarters in a row, the iPad has slumped and the Apple Watch is no blockbuster.

|Aug. 19, 2016, 2:19 PM|Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster on Apple's battery, AR, VR and automobile prospects



Batteries: "We believe that in the next three years, the area where Apple can make the most impactful improvement is in battery life. While batteries aren’t as exciting technologically as retina scanning or curved glass, we believe that functional improvements tend to drive the most consumer excitement and interest. For example, adding 3G to the iPhone 3G and the larger screen sizes for the iPhone 6 have been two of the biggest points of acceleration in the life of the phone."

Augmented reality: "More specifically, this could include additional camera features to pull in image based information and additional sensors to enable new interactions with the real world. AR enhancements on the iPhone could also come through enhanced software. Cook also spent time on the last earnings call highlighting the company’s work in artificial intelligence, including that much of Apple’s AI processing happens on the device instead of in the cloud. We believe that Apple could introduce new AR features enabled by its AI software also related to processing and predicting events and locations around the user in real-time. While we don’t expect AR- related features to drive an inflection in iPhone growth, we do see them as an important evolution in the device as we move beyond the smartphone. Long-term (beginning more meaningfully in 5-10 years), we continue to expect that some form of wearable, most likely in the form of glasses, will replace the majority of screens in our everyday lives. These wearables, and eventually contact lens or implant-based devices, will likely be the future of augmented reality hardware. We continue to expect that Apple will have a dedicated AR/MR product in the 2021-2025 timeframe."

Virtual reality: "We continue to believe that Apple will open up the iPhone for third-party VR hardware companies to make authorized headsets by 2018; however, it’s hard to see Apple developing a computer-powered high-end headset in the current market. Beyond the next few years, 10 years and beyond, we believe that all-in-one VR headsets will enable new experiences that replace how we use PCs and TVs today. We believe that those types of headsets could be more interested for Apple given that they are likely to be in the $500-1,500 ASP range vs smartphone-powered headsets at $100."

Automobile: "Initial WSJ reports suggested that the car had a “target ship date” of 2019; however, more recent reports suggest the launch is more likely in 2021 or five years from now. We believe that Apple could release some of its learnings before 2021 as it continues to develop its own car. For example, autonomous driving software could come out earlier via an automotive partner or more advanced CarPlay features. In terms of the market, as we’ve previously written, BMW might be the best comp for what Apple could do with the car in a wildly successful long-term scenario. BMW brand sold 1.9 million vehicles worldwide in 2015. At a $75k ASP, that would represent a $142.5 billion revenue opportunity. The bottom line is that the car, while it could still be scrapped, has the potential to be a true needle mover."
Munster maintains a $151 price target (current price $109.30) and Overweight rating on Apple (AAPL +0.2%).

Hoping to use one of its older products to help reverse two quarters of sliding sales, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is prepping the first significant overhaul to its MacBook Pro laptops in more than four years, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.
The new Pros will be thinner, have a touch screen strip for function keys, and will be offered with more powerful and efficient graphics processors for expert users like video gamers.
Mac sales have proved to be surprisingly resilient in the age of the tablet, rising 6% last fiscal year to $25.5B while iPad sales fell 23% to $23.2B. This set of changes is aimed at boosting notebook sales as consumers take longer to buy or replace their iPads.
The biggest addition to the new model is a secondary display above the keyboard that replaces the standard function key row. Instead of physical keys, a strip-like screen will present functions on an as-needed basis, depending on the current task or application.

He projects FY 2017 revenue of $224.5B, up from his previous estimate of $215B.

In negotiations with The Walt Disney Company early last year, Apple (AAPL +1%) demanded an extended invariable monthly per-viewer rate to license Disney's channels.
The existing cable-industry pattern regarding channel licensing involves yearly rate increases. A deal with Disney was subsequently not struck.
Other negotiations with 21st Century Fox and CBS Corporation (CBS) reportedly hit similar walls.
The separation of terms between Apple and major cable networks signals Apple's demands as too aggressive or programming too expensive (Google has this issue as well). Networks fear a specialized deal with Apple may reduce the amount of money they can generate from traditional cable distributors.
Apple's style of negotiation has also reportedly not aided its efforts. Senior vice president of Internet Software Services Eddy Cue has let media executives know that Apple has time to wait and will eventually get its way.
While looking for new areas to grow, Apple has so far not significantly innovated or disrupted in a TV industry it could stand to gain mightily from. Though it is making some effort, other companies (Netflix, Amazon) are taking it upon themselves to set the bar.

A day after posting better-than-expected Q3 results, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announces it has sold one billion iPhones.
Tim Cook on attaining the remarkable figure: "iPhone has become one of the most important, world-changing and successful products in history. It's become more than a constant companion. iPhone is truly an essential part of our daily life and enables much of what we do throughout the day. Last week we passed another major milestone when we sold the billionth iPhone. We never set out to make the most, but we’ve always set out to make the best products that make a difference. Thank you to everyone at Apple for helping change the world every day."

Apple's (AAPL +7%) cash on hand was reduced to $231.5B in Q3 vs. $233B in Q2, the first time in seven quarters this figure has decreased.
Research and development expenses rose for the nine-months-ended June 25 period to $7.475B vs. $5.847B Y/Y. The three-month-ended time frame saw an increase to $2.56B vs. $2.034B Y/Y.
Strategic investments in the nine-month-ended period are $1.376B vs. $0 Y/Y.
The majority of investment activity stems from the company's $1B investment in Didi Chuxing, a Chinese transportation service and Uber competitor.
Tim Cook on yesterday's conference call: "In terms of the investment in Didi, it was an unusual investment in  that, as you know, we don't have a long history of doing a lot of these. . . . From a Didi point of view, we see that as one, a great investment. Two,  we think that there's some strategic things that the companies can do  together over time. And three, we think that we'll learn a lot about the  business and the Chinese market beyond what we currently know. Didi has  an incredible team there. That's sort of the rational for why we did  that."
Although Apple appears to be utilizing a larger than usual (though still relatively small) portion of its vast cash pile, investors and consumers alike are waiting on the company's next innovative move, whether that be through existing product lineups, a Project Titan car initiative or any other surprise moves the company has on deck.

 In a surprise move, Apple (AAPL -0.6%) is the buyer of the Carpool Karaoke series being spun out of The Late Late Show with James Corden (NYSE:CBS). Apple will distribute the show via the Apple Music platform, where it sees a natural fit in the series (which will feature Corden driving celebrity guests around while they sing hits), and where it's been starting to turn to original video as a bonus for its paying subscribers. It's licensed 16 episodes. The segment, a small part of Corden's show, became a viral hit when shared online -- an increasingly vital part of holding down a traditional late-night TV show today -- and sparked a bidding war among programming buyers. The segments have generated more than 800M views online to date, CBS says. CBS still retains the rights to sell a second window of the series to a more traditional TV outlet.

He has led hardware engineering efforts on the development of the iMac, iPad and MacBook Air and was involved in the development of the Apple Watch.

"iPhone 2016 release: week of September 12th," he wrote on Twitter. "Just to clarify, this refers to the retail release, not the launch event. To be even more specific, it should happen on Friday, Sept. 16th."

Today Apple (AAPL +0.1%) launches its Apple Pay service in France, marking the eighth country it has become available in up to this point.
The company confirmed this expansion at its WWDC conference last month.
The United Kingdom and Switzerland were previously the only European countries to have access to the service.
Hong Kong and Spain launches are also expected in the near future.
Apple Pay is the company's foray into mobile payments and digital wallet technology with the iPhone, iPad and Watch lineups supporting its capabilities.

In a filing made with the Copyright Royalty Board, Apple (AAPL +1.3%) has proposed a retooling and simplification of songwriting royalty rates within a streaming environment. However, the rates Apple recommends would not apply to Apple Music, marking this memo an acute warning shot at its competitors, most namely Spotify (Private:MUSIC).
Apple ideates a 9.1 cent per 100 song plays model, a departure from the existing complex federal rules regulating streaming music that have allowed Spotify and others to offer free subscription tiers.
Apple Music only offers a paid model service and has direct deals with many artists present on its platform.
Google, Spotify, Pandora, Amazon and the Recording Industry Association of America were also expected to file similar briefs but none have yet become available.
This note comes as part of a process set up by the Copyright Royalty Board to determine download and streaming rates for the 2018-2022 period.

Concerns over smartphone demand have analyst Mark Moskowitz cutting his Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone unit estimates from 212.1M to 203.7M (2016) and 233.8M to 224.4M (2017).
New price target down to $115 from $121 with a retained Overweight rating. Since 2007 Apple has adhered to a biennial cycle when it comes to launching major iPhone device upgrades. However, this year's improvements are reported to be minor in nature with the next significant release not coming until 2017.
While highlighting anticipated near term demand pressure relative to this cycle extension, Moskowitz nonetheless expects the usual resurgence in share price around the time of this year's launch.

 Low expectations for the next iPhone are taking some of the risk out of a pre-launch period that's tended to be bullish for Apple (AAPL -0.2%), Gene Munster says. The Piper Jaffray analyst is holding an Overweight rating and $153 price target, implying a hefty 61% upside from today's $94.81. After a spate of headlines backing off sales expectations for the next phone, Munster is noting that resale value of the last phone is in line with the comparable phone during last year's post-launch period, pointing to aftermarket stability. The stock has outperformed on the ramp into the launch, he notes. "Looking back at the past three major number change iPhone Launches (4, 5, 6/6 Plus), shares of AAPL outperformed the S&P 500 on average by 14% with 12 weeks left until launch ... We believe we are 12 weeks away from the iPhone 7 being available for sale." |Jul. 6, 2016, 5:19 AM|Report: Next iPhone will start with double the storage


The new starting point for storage on the new entry-level iPhone will be 32GB, up from 16GB currently, sources told the WSJ.
The device, likely to come in September, is also rumored to have several substantial changes: the removal of headphone jacks, better cameras, longer battery life, thinner and more water resistant.
Wall Street is watching Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) profile, after the company saw its first Y/Y quarterly sales drop since 2003 during the second quarter.

 Gene Munster has reacted to news that Apple (AAPL +0.3%) is talking about a Tidal takeout with a price expectation: about half a billion dollars. The Piper Jaffray analyst expects that's would it would take to buy the streaming service -- just a bit of the $3B Apple paid for Beats Music, but still nearly 10 times the $56M that Jay-Z paid for the service when buying from Aspiro last year. Tidal's 4.2M subs would add to Apple Music's 15M and bring more hip-hop, Munster says, though Apple still trails Spotify (Private:MUSIC) by a ways. "The key take away is Apple continues to increase its focus on the highly profitable and predictable services business," Munster says. "In Apple’s Mar-16 quarter, services accounted for 12% of revenue, and grew at 20% y/y, with a ~60% gross margin. This compares to Apple’s overall business which saw revenue decline by 13% y/y, with a 39.4% gross margin." Munster has an Overweight rating on Apple and a price target of $153, implying 59.6% upside.

 Apple (AAPL +0.4%) has launched a return salvo at Spotify (Private:MUSIC) and its claims that Apple is acting anti-competitively, with a letter rejecting that charge. Apple's general counsel, Bruce Sewell, said in the letter that a rejection of an update to Spotify's app came due to a simple rules violation tied to in-app purchases. Subscription services must pay 30% of monthly fees to Apple if users sign up through the app, while they can avoid that 30% payment if their users sign up through companies' websites instead. But the companies cannot link to those other sites via their app, Sewell said. Spotify did that, and that's "a clear violation of the terms every other developer adheres to," Sewell wrote. “There is nothing in Apple’s conduct that ‘amounts to a violation of applicable antitrust laws,'” Sewell says. “Far from it.” |Jul. 1, 2016, 8:56 AM|Invesco Global Growth Fund A (AGGAX) June Summary

 Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in talks to acquire Tidal, the struggling music streaming service launched by producer/entrepreneur Jay-Z, The Wall Street Journal reports. That means a strong roster of artists tied to Tidal could give a boost to Apple Music. The talks are exploratory and might not end up in a deal, sources told the paper. Jay-Z launched Tidal (after buying its underlying company from Aspiro for $56M) alongside artists who had been given stakes in the service, including Kanye West, Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, Beyonce and Daft Punk.
Tidal has struggled to gain traction, however, because of relatively high prices compared to rivals, and pushing a lossless sound tier expected to appeal to just a small part of the marketplace. |Jun. 30, 2016, 3:08 PM|Spotify accuses Apple of anti-competitive behavior


Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is "causing grave harm to Spotify (Private:MUSIC) and its customers," by rejecting an update to Spotify's iOS app, goes a letter sent by Spotify's general counsel to Apple's top lawyer, reports Re/Code.
The letter suggests the streaming service intends to use the issue in its fight over Apple's rules governing subscription services using its App store, and copies of it went to - among others - Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who yesterday said, "Apple has long used its control of iOS to squash competition in music."
Spotify has used Apple's billing system for years, passing along the 30% charge to customers (who pay $13 per month instead of the $10 charged outside of Apple's store).
Since Apple launched its own music service, Spotify has been more vocal about encouraging customers to pay outside of iTunes - something which hasn't pleased Apple. Spotify, this month, revived a campaign offering new subscribers three months for $0.99 if they signed up on the company site. Spotify's lawyer says Apple threatened to remove the app from its store unless the company stopped telling iPhone users about the deal.

Coming alongside the exit of the country's central bank chief, India announces major reforms to its Foreign Direct Investment policies, which, among other things, clears the way for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to open stores there.
In other Apple news, there may be no back to future iPhones as the company was granted a patent for a wrap-around screen which would put a display on all sides of its devices.
In yet more news, Apple's weighting in the Russell 1000 will fall to about 2.52% from 2.77% when the index's annual reconstitution takes place at week's end. Much of this is due to the company's sizable buybacks, which have helped cut the market cap of Apple by more than $200B from a year ago. What's it mean? Fund managers pegged to the index will have to sell about $1.3B of Apple shares at the close on Friday, according to Credit Suisse.
Also, Apple will be classified as both a growth and value company, with 92% of the company considered "growth" and 8% "value." The upshot - growth fund managers will have to lighten up, while value fund managers will be buyers. Credit Suisse notes there's more money benchmarked to growth, meaning net selling in Apple.

The report follows ones indicating Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) plans to launch iPhones featuring OLEDs in 2017, with some of the reports stating Samsung and LG Display (LPL -0.3%) will be among the suppliers. A Korean news service reported in April Samsung will supply 100M 5.5" OLEDs annually to Apple starting next year. The Nikkei suggests Apple will partly rely on OLEDs for its 2017 iPhone lineup.

iOS 10 brings a revamped lock screen and support for more advanced notifications. Users can interact with messages from a lock screen via 3D Touch, and notification widgets can support video and other rich media content. 3D Touch can be used with notifications to interact with and pull up more data from the underlying app.
As expected, Apple (AAPL -1.2%) has renamed Mac OS X to macOS. The next-gen version of Apple's PC OS is codenamed Sierra, and heavily emphasizes integration with other Apple hardware. A universal clipboard can be simultaneously accessed by macOS and iOS devices, and a feature called Auto Unlock lets users unlock a Mac using an Apple Watch. iCloud Drive is being updated to let users see the same desktop on multiple Macs, as well as iPhones.
Siri is arriving on Macs, and (as rumored) Apple Pay will support web-based Apple Pay payments, including via TouchID fingerprint authentication. Safari-like tabs will be supported by apps in general, videos can be moved to a picture-in-picture box, and old/unused files can be automatically moved to iCloud to free up storage space.
Also confirmed: Siri is being opened up to third-party developers. Siri will be integrated with the iOS keyboard to make "intelligent suggestions," and leverage a user's location and contact info. The Photos app is being updated to support (with the help of AI) face and object-recognition, and to automatically group related pictures - echoes of Google Photos, but with the processing done on a device rather than in the cloud.
Apple Maps is also being opened to developers. Maps' UI has been revamped, and the app now provides suggestions to users about local points of interest. Apple Music, which now has over 15M paid subs (up from 13M in April), has been updated to feature lyrics and provide better discovery tools.
Apple News now supports access to subscriptions, along with breaking news notifications. A new Home app for iOS and watchOS will act as a hub for controlling smart home devices relying on Apple's HomeKit framework. There are also phone updates: Voicemails get transcribed and can be automatically scanned for potential spam (useful in China). The Messages app now supports links with embedded media content.

The remarks come ahead of Apple's June 13-17 WWDC conference, and highlight Apple's interest in helping developers better promote and monetize their apps. A recent Localytics study found 23% of installed apps are only used once before being abandoned, and that only 38% are launched 11 or more times. Meanwhile, App Annie reports 75% of April App Store revenue came from games alone (largely via in-app purchases).
Apple stated in January over $20B was spent on the App Store in 2015. That implied Apple received net revenue of more than $6B, via its 30% cut.

The move comes after bank cut its estimate of smartphone unit growth this year to 5% from 6%, and for 2017 to 4% from 7%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains Buy-rated, however, with Goldman saying even its conservative model implies upside to consensus earnings estimates. The Street has 2017 sales too low as it's not considering an increase in upgrades with the iPhone 7 based on pent-up demand evident in a recent bank consumer survey, says Goldman.

 Apple (AAPL -0.4%) plans to stretch out the product lifecycle on iPhones, moving to three years between full model changes rather than two, Nikkei is reporting. That'll be effective with this fall, when the company might have been expected to produce a major upgrade, but instead will offer minor improvements, Nikkei says. Iphones have notably slowed down for the company, but it's also the case that smartphones are running out of room for major new feature sets. The coming iPhone is expected to have an improved camera and no headphone jack, and better water resistance and battery capacity. Meanwhile, Nikkei says, a 2017 iPhone model is more likely to include bigger changes, including adoption of an organic electroluminescent display. |May 26, 2016, 9:27 AM|FT: Apple exec proposed Time Warner bid; Netflix +3.7% on link

 Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is up 3.7% premarket, and Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) up 0.9%, after the two were linked as takeover targets in a story about Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) content ambitions. The Financial Times reports that Apple exec Eddy Cue raised the idea of buying Time Warner at a meeting with the company's head of corporate strategy at the end of last year. Those ideas didn't get to Apple chief Tim Cook or Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes, sources told the FT, but the story does suggest Apple may not be content just talking about licensing others' content for a future TV service. Meanwhile, several bankers suggest to the FT that Netflix is a more likely target for Apple, since an Apple service could then still support a wider range of content makers. Several media companies would be bad targets for Apple because of dual-share structures that favor founders or family ownership (like Comcast, Fox, CBS, and Viacom). Notable exceptions to that concern are Time Warner and Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS). |May 25, 2016, 3:12 PM|Reuters: Apple will have to sell 30% local goods in Indian retail outlets

 India will require Apple (AAPL +1.4%) to sell at least 30% locally sourced goods if it wants to open up retail outlets, a senior government official tells Reuters. Apple plans to open retail stores within 18 months in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, along with a number of initiatives announced contingent with CEO Tim Cook's visit to the country last week. A legislative change last year made foreign retailers who sell high-tech goods exempt from the 30%-local rule -- but Apple's products weren't counted in that category, the source said: "They did ask for a waiver but didn't provide any material on record to justify it." Such a waiver is available only for investment in "state of the art" technology, he said. |May 24, 2016, 5:08 PM|Report: Apple is prepping an Amazon Echo rival, opening up Siri



The Information reports Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is working on "an Amazon Echo-like device with a speaker and microphone that people can use to turn on music, get news headlines or set a timer." It adds Siri, which will naturally power the assistant, will be opened up to third-party developers through an SDK to be unveiled at the WWDC conference (runs from June 13-17).
While Siri supports some third-party services such as Yelp, Apple hasn't yet released an SDK that any developer can use to create Siri-powered services. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rolled out an SDK last year for Alexa, the voice assistant powering its Echo speaker line, which has gradually turned into a hit and was recently updated to include cheaper hardware.
The report comes a week after Google unveiled a "conversational" assistant service that builds upon Google Now, and said it would support third-party services. Microsoft competes in the voice assistant space via Cortana, and Facebook has dipped its toes into the market via M, an assistant (currently in beta) that combines AI-based and human services.

Taiwan's Economic Daily News reports Apple (AAPL +1.7%) has ordered contract manufacturers to produce 72M-78M iPhone 7 units this year, a record figure for a new iPhone and above analyst estimates of ~65M.
Apple is outperforming on a day the Nasdaq is up 0.3%. As are chip suppliers Cirrus Logic (CRUS +3.1%), Skyworks (SWKS +3.3%), Qorvo (QRVO +2.7%), and InvenSense (INVN +4.6%). Over in Taipei, Foxconn parent Hon Hai Precision (OTC:HNHAF) rose 4.6%, and fellow iPhone manufacturer Pegatron (OTC:PGTRF) rose 9.9%. TSMC (TSM +2.7%), which is believed to be the exclusive manufacturer of Apple's A10 processor (expected to go into the iPhone 7), is also doing well.
The report comes with Apple having guided calendar Q2 revenue to be down 13%-17% Y/Y due to soft iPhone 6S sales. The rumor mill has indicated the iPhone 7 will feature a dual-camera array and a 256GB storage option, and do away with the 3.5mm headphone jack. The 9.7" iPad Pro's improved display suggests display enhancements are also possible.

 A deal for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to invest $1B in Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing (Private:DIDI) came together with amazing speed -- a day over three weeks -- after starting with a simple Apple HQ visit to discuss the Chinese market. On April 20 in Cupertino, Didi chief Jean Liu joked with Apple CEO Tim Cook that any company named after a fruit "could achieve something big" and that Didi's legal name, Xiaoju Kuaizhi, means “little orange." Apple stock had made gains earlier today but gave up some of those along with the market's afternoon snooze. It's closed up 0.2%, just barely over the 52-week low it established yesterday. In the deal, Didi will get capital to expand into new cities and draw new driver as it battles Uber (Private:UBER), while Apple gets a closer relationship with fellow Didi backers like Alibaba and Tencent Holdings, companies that could help Apple market Apple Pay and other services.

Having partnered with IBM in 2014 and Cisco in 2015, Apple (AAPL -1.3%) is now partnering with German enterprise software giant SAP (SAP -0.5%) to enable iOS apps that can leverage SAP's popular Hana in-memory database (used to power high-speed analytics and transaction-processing apps).
The companies plan to create an SDK that lets developers build iOS apps that can leverage the Hana Cloud Platform (provides cloud access to Hana database services) and also access "core data and business processes" on S/4HANA, Hana-powered versions of SAP's core enterprise apps.
In addition, SAP will "develop native iOS apps for critical business operations," and create an app design language that combines SAP's Fiori user experience with "a consumer-grade iOS experience."
Owing to both favorable demographics (enterprise device users tend to be wealthier) and solid developer support, the enterprise has been fertile ground for iOS.

"The near-term weakness in the AAPL supply chain is well known at this point, but with a likely more muted [iPhone 7] cycle and content increases well understood, we would rather move to the sidelines and revisit next year," writes Barclays' Blayne Curtis, downgrading Cirrus Logic (CRUS -4.7%) to Equal Weight and cutting his target by $2 to $35.
Curtis: "We still like the technology and continue to see LT opportunities, but struggle to identify further catalysts until next year when CRUS could see gains in the mid-tier (OEMs 3-10) for Android, another codec content increase and/or an in-box [smart codec] win at AAPL. We have not seen any evidence yet, but we are also worried that pressure at AAPL could filter down the supply chain, similar to post the [iPhone 5]..."
He previously asserted Cirrus will likely only ship a basic audio codec ($1 ASP) rather than a smart codec supporting noise cancellation ($2-$2.50 ASP) for the digital headset expected to accompany the iPhone 7, which is widely believed to do away with the standard 3.5mm headphone jack and have all wired headsets connect through a Lightning port. However, Curtis does think Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will put another speaker in the space currently occupied by the 3.5mm jack, which would require another amplifier from Cirrus ($0.40-$0.50 ASP).
Cirrus initially sold off on last week after providing soft FQ1 guidance in its FQ4 report (released in tandem with Apple's FQ2 report), but wound up posting double-digit gains the next day. Earnings call comments about design win activity, including for digital headsets and smart codecs, may have helped.

A telecom ministry official talking with Bloomberg says the Indian government has rejected an Apple (AAPL +0.7%) request to import and sell refurbished iPhones. The country's environment ministry rejected a similar proposal in 2015.
Selling refurbished iPhones - made available to Apple through its iPhone upgrade, trade-in, and recycling programs - has been a key part of Apple's plans to grow sales in cost-sensitive India, where the company's phone share is estimated to be around 2% and cheap Android phones claim much of the smartphone market.
Bloomberg notes Apple rivals launched a public campaign against its effort to sell used iPhones, arguing "such a move would trigger a flood of used electronics while defeating the government’s Make-in-India program to encourage local manufacturing." IDC believes local OEMs Micromax, Intex, and Lava are among the Indian smartphone market's top five players, along with Lenovo and market leader Samsung, which gets the majority of its Indian sales from its low-cost J-series Android phones.

Yesterday, Tim Cook talked up the Indian market's long-term potential during an appearance on Jim Cramer's Mad Money.

"I think that is a huge over reaction look we just had actually an incredible quarter by absolute standards," says Tim Cook during an appearance on Jim Cramer's Mad Money. "What we’re seeing is that people are upgrading at a different rate a lower rate than they did last year but still higher than the year before ... the satisfaction has never been higher and the loyalty rates have never been higher." (video)
The defense comes six days after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported its FQ2 (calendar Q1) sales were down 13% Y/Y, and guided for FQ3 revenue to be down 13%-17%. It also arrives four days after Carl Icahn (once set a $240 Apple target and predicted $37.5B in FY17 sales for an Apple TV set that doesn't yet exist) disclosed he had liquidated his Apple position.
Following a Q1 in which global smartphone sales were roughly flat, Cook dismisses concerns the smartphone market is saturated. "Penetration today is in the 40s a long way to go. Emerging markets like India LTE penetration is zero we’ve got great innovation in the pipeline new iPhones that will incent you and other people that have iPhones today to upgrade..."
He insists recent Chinese sales pressures won't last. "[T]he iPhone upgrade rate affects all countries including China. The great thing is, the [Android] switcher rate in China is huge. 40% up over the first half of last year, the first half of this year ... Economy, clearly not as strong as it was a year ago. Softening. Currency weakening ... five years ago, there were about 50 million people in the Chinese middle class. Five years from now that number’s going to be almost 500 million ... I could not be more optimistic about China."
Cook on India: "India will be the most populous country in the world in 2022. India today has about 50% of their population at 25 years of age or younger ... And this year, the first year, LTE begins to roll out ... the carriers don’t sell phones in India. So there’s a lot of work to do. But last quarter we grew 56% in India on iPhone units."
On the Apple Watch: "[I]f you look at iPod, iPod wasn’t viewed as a success [when it first launched], but today it’s viewed as an overnight success ... I think that in a few years we will look back and people will say, “How could I have ever thought about not wearing this watch?” Because it’s doing so much for you. And then it will all of a sudden be an overnight success."
Apple fell fractionally in regular trading. Shares are $1.64 above a 52-week low of $92.00, and trade for 10.2x an FY17 GAAP EPS consensus of $9.15.

The smartphone market isn't currently growing due to macro headwinds, says Tim Cook on Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) FQ2 call. "This too shall pass," he insists. Apple once more blames tough Y/Y comps (i.e. strong year-ago iPhone 6 sales), macro, and forex for sales growth pressures. (live blogs, BI, MarketWatch).
Cook adds the Apple Watch's sales during its first 12 months of availability topped the iPhone's sales during its first 12 months (5.4M, per Statista). As usual, no specific Watch sales figure is given. Watch sales are expected to be very seasonal, with ~40% coming in calendar Q4. IDC estimates Watch shipments totaled 11.6M in 2015.
"We added more switchers from Android in the first half of this year than in any other 6-month period ever," Cook asserts. He also notes a survey stating 78% of corporate buyers want iPhones. Regarding India, he declares the country is "where China was 7-10 years ago." As for China (FQ2 sales -26% Y/Y to $12.5B), he thinks the market is "not as weak as been talked about."
CFO Luca Maestri says iPhone ASP (affected by the SE) will drop again in FQ3, and that the SE will impact margins. He asserts App Store growth fueled the 20% Y/Y increase seen in Apple's services revenue (to $6B). Also helping: Apple Music subscribers have topped 13M, up from 11M in February. The average amount spent by App Store customers is said to have hit a record in FQ2.
Also mentioned: 1) Cook says the upgrade rate for the iPhone 6S cycle is above that for the 5S cycle, but lower than that for the 6 cycle. 2) Forex had a 400 bps impact on revenue growth (-13% Y/Y vs. -9%). 3) 15 companies have been acquired over the last 4 quarters. Notably, Cook suggests Apple is open to making a larger acquisition than the ones it has made in the past. The $3B Beats deal is Apple's largest to date.

 Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due to disclose its FQ2 earnings after the bell today, with analysts expecting the company to report that revenue slumped 10.4% to $52B in what would be the firm's first on-year sales drop in 13 years. EPS is estimated to have fallen to $2 from $2.33. Declining iPhone sales are believed to have hurt earnings, with Seeking Alpha author Mark Hibben writing that "iPhone SE and the 9.7 inch iPad Pro probably arrived too late in the quarter to have much impact." There are also fears that iPhone volumes will underwhelm this quarter as well. IDC's Ryan Reith notes that the overall smartphone market is slowing."Apple has had ridiculous growth where they have outpaced the market and that has to change at some point," Reith says.

Startup Light’s L16 camera is the first salvo in the company's attempt to upend a digital SLR market dominated by Canon (NYSE:CAJ) and Nikon (OTCPK:NINOY). The L16 contains 16 different sets of lenses and sensors - five shoot at 35mm, and the other 11 at 75-150mm - in a form factor resembling that of point-and-shoot cameras. Up to ten of the lenses/sensors simultaneously fire when a picture is taken.
As a result, only zoom and shutter speed are determined at the time of shooting. Unlike with conventional cameras, qualities such as focus and depth-of-field can be adjusted afterwards thanks to the L16’s use of computational imaging. Meanwhile, having up to ten lenses/sensors fire at once allows the L16 to create images as large as 52MP, and helps a lot with low-light photography.
At $1,699, the L16 isn’t cheap. And even if one was willing to spend that much to buy one, pre-orders have sold out. However, Light insists the L16 is simply a proof-of-concept, and that its long-term goal is give consumers cameras that can deliver both professional-quality photos and smartphone-like simplicity. Light could have a tough time winning over professional photographers who depend on DSLRs and their professional-grade lenses. However, the company insists enthusiast consumer photographers are a larger opportunity.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may be looking to provide similar functionality on a much smaller scale with the iPhone 7. The next-gen iPhone is rumored to sport a dual-lens camera that leverages technology developed by computational imaging startup LinX (acquired in 2015).

With an average estimated price of $500 for the Watch, that's a $6B business - not too shabby at all. Still, critics complain about the product's lack of speed, under-powered processor, limited functionality and lack of a defining purpose. |Apr. 22, 2016, 2:38 PM|Report: Internal fighting slows Apple's efforts to improve cloud services



The Information reports two Apple (AAPL -0.6%) engineering teams working on creating new cloud infrastructure meant to improve the reliability of iCloud and other services are “in open conflict.” An engineering manager (Steve D’Aurora) has resigned, and more departures are expected.
The turf war reportedly stems from Apple’s 2015 decision to extend the reach of the cloud platform that powers Siri to other services, such as iCloud, iMessage, and iTunes. That led the Siri team (features ~200 employees) to battle with an engineering team (features 1,000+ employees) responsible for many of those cloud offerings. “Philosophical differences” have emerged for many technical issues.
The report follows ones in March stating Apple has launched an effort (codenamed Project McQueen) to create a cloud infrastructure that would lower the company’s reliance on third-party clouds, and that Apple - already a user of Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure - has begun using the Google Cloud Platform to help power iCloud.
Analyst Ben Thompson recently argued Apple’s “functional organization” structure, in which leaders are given responsibilities tied to areas of expertise (design, operations, software, etc.) rather than products (iPhone, iPad, etc.), has hurt the quality of Apple’s services, even as it creates great integrated user experiences in other realms. He concluded Apple’s services “need to be separated from the devices that are core to the company, and the managers of those services need to be held accountable via dollars and cents.”

Looking for a way to better differentiate against rival cover glass solutions (and perhaps boost sale prices along the way), Corning (GLW +0.2%) has launched Vibrant Gorilla Glass, a solution that lets device makers imprint "multi-color, high resolution, photo-quality images" on Gorilla Glass.
Corning exec Scott Forester declares Vibrant Gorilla Glass gives device makers "a new opportunity for customized decoration and commercial branding." One possible use: Giving mobile OEMs the ability to imprint their brand logos on Gorilla Glass when it's used on the back panel of a device.
Samsung uses Gorilla Glass on the back of the Galaxy S6 and S7, in addition to having it protect the screen on the front. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which also relies on Gorilla Glass for screen-protection, is rumored to be using an all-glass enclosure for its 2017 iPhones.

 There's some buzz out of Germany that Apple (AAPL -0.7%) has a secret R&D lab up and running with 20 employees working on an electric vehicle project. The original report in German is from Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, while Mashable has a mashup of the latest Apple Car development. The publication deduces that Apple is considering German manufacturing and will partner with supplier Magna International (MGA +0.8%).
Germany isn't completely foreign territory for Apple as it dabbles with EV car possibilities. Last year, CEO Tim Cook met with BMW (OTCPK:BAMXY) execs and toured an i3 manufacturing site in Leipzig. Earlier today, Electrek reported that former Tesla (TSLA -4.3%) VP of vehicle engineering Chris Porritt moved to Apple to work on the company's EV project. The publication speculates that Porritt could be a candidate to head Project Titan which has been operating in a leadership void since Steve Zadesky stepped down.

Apple's (AAPL -0.3%) ultra-thin 12" retina MacBooks (launched a year ago) have been updated to include 1.1-1.3GHz. dual-core Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Core M CPUs based on the chip giant's Skylake architecture, which was released last summer/fall. The original MacBooks used CPUs based on Intel's prior-gen Broadwell architecture. The Skylake chips come with an integrated GPU (the Intel HD 515) said to deliver up to 25% better graphics performance.
Apple has also provided faster PCIe flash storage for its retina MacBooks, and promises an additional hour of battery life. A rose gold option has been added to go with existing gold, silver, and space grey options. The notebooks still sport an all-metal enclosure and Force Touch trackpad, and continues relying on a single USB Type-C port for power and data.
A base model (1.1GHz. Core M3 CPU with Turbo Boost speeds of up to 2.2GHz. and 256GB of storage) still goes for $1,299, and a more powerful model (1.2GHz Core M5 CPU with Turbo Boost up to 2.7GHz., 512GB of storage) for $1,599. A Core M7 CPU is available via configure-to-order options.
With a weak PC market weighing, Apple's Mac revenue fell 3% Y/Y in calendar Q4 to $6.7B, with units dropping 4% to 5.3M. ASP rose to $1,270 from the prior quarter's $1,205.

Update: Apple has also quietly made a small-but-notable update to the $999 base model for the 13" MacBook Air: It now comes with 8GB of RAM instead of 4GB.

Bloomberg reports Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is thinking of adding an advertising service to the App Store through which developers would pay to have their apps shown at the top of search results. Much like search ads on Google or Bing, advertisers would bid to receive placement when certain keywords (say, "photos" or "racing game") are searched for.
Apple is also reportedly looking for ways to improve App Store browsing. ~100 employees are said to be working on the effort to overhaul the App Store, including many engineers previously on the iAd mobile ad team, which has been scaled back.
The search ads would act as new competition for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), widely believed to be the biggest player in the mobile app install ad market - Facebook gets paid when ads shown within its apps and mobile ad network lead to downloads/installs. Even back in mid-2014, JPMorgan estimated app install ads were driving ~$400M in quarterly revenue for Facebook.
Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has entered this space via install ads appearing in mobile search results and the Play Store. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) also competes, but is believed to be a smaller player.
Apple reported in January over $20B was spent on the App Store in 2015. That implies net revenue over more than $6B via Apple's 30% cut. Paid search listings would give developers that have struggled to have their apps get noticed in the App Store (it now has over 1.5M apps) a new way to do so. At the same time, smaller developers could have a hard time outbidding larger, deeper-pocketed, rivals for popular keywords.

He figures gross profit from Services has grown from $3.2B in 2010 to $14.5B (or 15% of total) today, and by 2020 could grow to $33.7B or 29% of total, driven by three factors:
1) The installed base of more than 1B active devices and nearly 600M unique users are highly affluent and like to transact (spending 7x more than Android users). 2) As Apple Pay, Apple Music, and iCloud take hold, Services spend per user could nearly double in five years to $113. 3) Service opportunities in the TV/Video market.

The WSJ's Geoffrey Fowler, reviewing Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) 4" iPhone SE: "Unlike many other recent Apple products, the iPhone SE’s [battery life] is a significant improvement over its predecessors’. In my lab stress test, which cycles through websites with uniform screen brightness, the SE lasted 10 hours—more than two hours longer than both the iPhone 6s and iPhone 5s, and nearly three hours longer than the Galaxy S7."
With the SE's body similar to that of the 5S, and its internals having much in common with the 6S/6S+, the rest of Fowler's review doesn't contain many surprises. A Geekbench test found the SE (powered by an A9 CPU) delivers ~70% better performance than the (A7-powered) 5S. Its 12MP rear camera "performs admirably in most settings," though Samsung's Galaxy S7 is said to provide better low-light shots. And one-handed use is naturally easier than it is with the SE's larger siblings.
In other Apple news, the company has announced it's working with musician Will.i.am on an original TV series about the app economy. Details are scant about the show's financing and storylines, or about how much the iOS App Store will be promoted.

It adds Apple has considered making the service available on sites accessed via Macs, but it isn't clear if the company will do so.
Apple Pay already supports payments carried out via mobile apps, to go with its well-known support for NFC-based in-store payments. An announcement regarding mobile site support could occur during the annual WWDC conference (typically occurs in June).
Online payments leader PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is down 1.2% after hours to $40.03.

As Re/code notes, PayPal's Braintree unit provides back-end payment processing for some in-app Apple Pay purchases. But PayPal profits more if purchases are made via PayPal accounts. Aside from the size of its iOS base, favorable demographics make Apple a mobile payments threat: iOS users tend to be wealthier on average than Android users in a given market, and more likely to make purchases with their devices.

We had some discussions with Imagination, but we do not plan to make an offer for the company at this time."|Mar. 22, 2016, 10:28 AM|Apple reportedly in "advanced talks" to buy GPU core developer Imagination (updated)


Tech news site Ars Technica reports Apple (AAPL +1.1%) is in "advanced talks" to buy U.K.-based Imagination Technologies (OTCPK:IGNMF), whose PowerVR GPU cores are used within Apple's A-series processors. Imagination is up 19.6% in London; its market cap stands at $869M.
Acquiring Imagination would further add to Apple's chip R&D efforts. Right now, those efforts include designing the A-series chips and the custom ARM CPU cores that go into them, the M9 motion co-processor, and fingerprint sensor and LCD timing controller ICs.
Apple already owns an 8.4% stake in Imagination, and has often trumpeted the graphics capabilities of its hardware - yesterday, the company declared the A9X processor going into the iPad Pro has more GPU power than an Xbox 360. Apple could presumably buy Imagination with offshore cash.
An Apple/Imagination deal could spell an opportunity for ARM (ARMH -0.3%), whose Mali GPU cores compete with Imagination's PowerVR line, to take share at non-Apple Imagination customers such as Samsung. iPhone/iPad audio codec supplier Cirrus Logic (CRUS -1.1%) is down slightly - Imagination's product line includes voice pre-processing IP, but GPU cores drive the lion's share of the company's business.
Apple is trading higher a day after revealing the 4" iPhone SE and the 9.7" iPad Pro.

Update (11:34): Apple says it doesn't plan to make an offer to buy Imagination, while adding it did hold talks with the company.

A federal judge has agreed to postpone today's court hearing with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at the FBI's request, after the latter revealed that a third party had "demonstrated an alternate method" for unlocking the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters.
Instead of the hearing, U.S. Magistrate Judge Sherri Pym ordered the government to file a status update by April 5.
Besides privacy issues and the fight over encryption, the move would shatter the illusion that Apple can create unbreakable software and push off one of the most closely watched cases of the digital age.
|Mar. 21, 2016, 2:06 PM|Apple unveils a 9.7" iPad Pro with an improved display and a $599 start price


The 9.7" iPad Pro (also rumored) weighs less than 1 pound. Its oxide TFT display is said to be 25% brighter and have 25% greater color saturation than an iPad Air 2's, and to have the lowest reflectivity of any tablet. Meanwhile, its "True Tone" display measures the color temperature of ambient light and adjusts the screen in response.
Like its 12.9" sibling, the 9.7" Pro sports Apple's (AAPL -0.4%) A9X CPU and M9 motion co-processor. Its 12-core GPU is declared to be more powerful than the Xbox 360's. Other specs include a 12MP rear camera, a 5MP front camera, four stereo speakers, and four metal finishes (inc. rose gold for the first time). 3D Touch apparently isn't supported.
The Apple Pencil stylus and Smart Keyboard accessory are supported; 3D Touch apparently isn't. Looking to make more inroads with professionals and creative pros, Apple has unveiled SD card reader and USB camera adapter accessories for the Pro.
As rumored, the 9.7" Pro starts at $599 (32GB Wi-Fi-only model). A 128GB model goes for $749, and a 256GB model will be available for $899. As with the iPhone SE, pre-orders start on March 24, and the device ships on March 31. The iPad Air 2's starting price has been cut by $100 to $399, and a 256GB ($1099) option has been added for the 12.9" Pro. The iPad Mini starts at $269, and the original iPad Air has been discontinued.
80% of active iOS devices run on iOS 9 (launched six months ago). 200M 9.7" iPads have been cumulatively sold, and over 1M iPad apps are now available in the App Store. SVP Phil Schiller states a majority of iPad Pro users have been Windows users. iOS 9.3 (supports a Night Shift feature that changes a devices color temperature based on time and location) is rolling out later today.

|Mar. 21, 2016, 1:40 PM|Apple unveils 4" iPhone SE with $399 starting price, cuts Apple Watch's starting price to $299


On the outside, the rumored 4" iPhone SE is only modestly changed relative to the iPhone 5S. On the inside, it has been given an A9 CPU (much more powerful than the 5S' A7 CPU) and M9 motion co-processor, a 12MP rear camera that uses the A9's image signal processor, an NFC radio/Apple Pay support, an 802.11ac Wi-Fi radio, and support for 150Mbps LTE download speeds.
Live Photos support, 4K video capture, and hands-free "Hey Siri" activation are also supported. Notably, the 16GB SE goes for only $399 unsubsidized (the 5S previously started at $450), with a 64GB model going for $499. Pre-orders start on March 24, and the phone ships on March 31. 110 countries will be supported by the end of May.
Apple (AAPL -0.3%) sold over 30M 4" iPhones in 2015, says Apple exec Greg Joswiak. He adds a large % new iPhone users (including a majority of new Chinese users) get 4" iPhones.
The Apple Watch Sport edition's starting price has been cut by $50 to $299, Tim Cook discloses. Cook declares the Apple Watch is now the world's top-selling smartwatch, and (as expected) has unveiled new bands - a woven nylon band + new colors for existing band types.
Over 5,000 Apple TV apps are now available - a revamped Apple TV supporting the App Store and Siri was launched last September. The Apple TV's UI has been updated to add support for voice dictation, Siri integration for the App Store, and folder and Live Photos support.
Cook once more defended Apple's unwillingness to create an iPhone backdoor for the FBI. "We need to decide, as a nation, how much power the government should have over our data and our privacy ... We owe it to our customers and we owe it to our country. This is an issue that impacts all of us, and we will not shrink from this responsibility."
Apple exec Lisa Jackson states 93% of Apple's facilities run on renewable energy, including all of its U.S. facilities. COO Jeff Williams highlighted the use of Apple's ResearchKit platform in medical research, and unveiled CareKit, an open-source framework for creating apps that let users review and share their health data. He promises users will have full control over what data is shared.

|Mar. 21, 2016, 10:33 AM|The Supreme Court will hear Samsung's appeal of Apple's 2012 patent win


The Supreme Court, which typically hears ~1% of the cases appealed to it, has agreed to hear Samsung's (OTC:SSNLF) appeal of the penalties imposed on the company related to Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) 2012 victory in a patent infringement suit filed with a Northern California federal court.
In December, Samsung paid Apple $548M in damages related to the 2012 ruling - Apple was previously awarded $930M, but an appeals court took away $382M in trade dress dilution damages. Before the S.C., Samsung is challenging the $399M awarded to Apple for infringement of the company's design IP (e.g. rounded-corner front faces, bezels, icon grids), arguing they contributed only marginally to its hardware.
A reminder: The disputed funds equal less than 0.1% of Apple's market cap and less than 0.3% of Samsung's, and the fervor of the mobile patent wars has cooled considerably since 2012. In 2014, Apple and Samsung agreed to end their non-U.S. patent battles.
|Mar. 21, 2016, 2:55 AM|Apple to bolster lineup with new iPhone


Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to introduce a new version of its smallest current iPhone during an event at its Cupertino headquarters today, as the tech giant grapples with slowing growth of its flagship product.
The successor to the iPhone 5s (called the SE or 5SE) will likely  include an upgraded processor, improved camera and capability to use  Apple Pay.
In the fiscal first quarter ended in December, iPhone sales rose 0.4% - its slowest rate of growth since Apple introduced the device in 2007. Analysts also forecast sales to fall for the first time in the current quarter.

|Mar. 18, 2016, 12:04 PM|Reports: New iPad to start at $599, Apple working on major cloud project


Ahead of Apple's (AAPL) Monday event (expected to feature the unveiling of a 4" iPhone SE and a 9.7" iPad Pro), 9to5 Mac reports the 9.7" Pro model will come in 32GB and 128GB capacities and start at $599. By contrast, the iPad Air 2 comes in 16GB, 64GB, and 128GB capacities, and starts at $499.
Apple, which saw iPad revenue drop 21% Y/Y in calendar Q4 to $7.1B, reportedly plans to continue supporting the Air 2 "at a likely $499 price." Meanwhile, dwindling supplies of the original Air at resellers suggest the tablet will be discontinued. The 9.7" Pro is expected to feature four stereo speakers, an A9X CPU, a Smart Connector, and support for the Apple Pencil stylus.
Meanwhile, VentureBeat reports Apple has been working on "Project McQueen," an effort to create its own cloud infrastructure for digital content and cut its dependence on third-party clouds, for the last several months. Re/code has issued a similar report, while adding "unclear if that project will materialize or when."
VentureBeat states Apple, which has been relying on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure to handle services such as iTunes and iCloud, isn't happy "with the fact AWS is not able to very quickly load photos and videos onto users’ iOS devices," and that the company would have to pay to help Microsoft expand Azure's footprint to meet its needs. CRN recently reported Apple has signed up for the Google Cloud Platform, and significantly cut its AWS usage.
Apple, which has been on a data center construction spree, reportedly thinks building out its own cloud computing/storage infrastructure would pay for itself in three years. The company has set a $15B FY16 (ends Sep. '16) capex budget (covers manufacturing, retail, IT, and data center investments), after having spent $11.2B on capex in FY15.
|Mar. 16, 2016, 5:24 PM|Report: Apple signs up for Google's cloud, uses much less of Amazon's (updated)


Sources tell enterprise tech site CRN Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has begun using Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) cloud infrastructure (IaaS) platform, and has "significantly reduced its reliance" on market leader Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN), which it has used to help run iCloud and other services.
Google execs have reportedly told partners Apple is spending $400M-$600M on the Google Cloud Platform - CRN says it isn't clear if this reflects an annual spending rate or capacity purchases. Morgan Stanley estimated last month Apple, which has been investing heavily in its own data center infrastructure, spends ~$1B/year on AWS.
The report comes three weeks after Spotify, which has relied on both AWS and its own servers, announced it's migrating its infrastructure to the Google Cloud Platform. It also shortly follows a Wired column about cloud storage giant Dropbox's (Private:DROPB) efforts to migrate stored files from AWS to a home-grown infrastructure relying on "a software system built by its own programmers with a brand new programming language" (not something many companies have the resources to pull off). Aside from Spotify, known Google clients include Snapchat, Coca-Cola, Best Buy, and Sony.
Amazon still towers over the IaaS market, while Google is viewed as #3 or #4 (behind Amazon, Microsoft, and perhaps IBM). Synergy Research estimates Google's IaaS and cloud app platform (PaaS) revenue totaled less than ~$300M in Q4; Amazon reported Q4 AWS revenue of $2.4B (+69% Y/Y).
Michael Fraser, head of cloud management software firm InfiniteOps, argues Google's huge fiber network provides bandwidth cost savings - possibly an incentive for Apple, given the amount of download activity it handles - and that its platform (per InfiniteOps' tests) delivers better performance than that of any major rival. "Google is actually the cheapest play in the market when you take into consideration everything they're doing and when you take into account their various incentives."
Amazon closed down 0.5% after slipping in the wake of CRN's column (the Nasdaq rose 0.8%), and is down 1% in after-hours trading.

Update: The Information's Amir Efrati backs up CRN, while suggesting Apple is getting the best of the deal. "It’s true, @iCloud to be partially powered by @googlecloud. But will take a year & unlikely to be profitable. @awscloud lost $ from iCloud."

"We are reiterating our Buy rating and $120 price target despite continued cautious commentary from the supply chain.
"We think iPhone shipment numbers will continue to vary on a quarterly basis and iPhone 7 cycle will likely not be as big as iPhone 6, while it still remains to be seen if it can grow over iPhone 6s.
"However, if we look at LTV of iPhone customers and assume modest growth in the installed base, we think the stock should be worth in the $120-130 range even if iPhone 7 units end up being lackluster initially. We expect supply chain data points to inflect on the positive side starting late spring/early summer."
Mizuho's Japan team sees production down 18% to 206M units in 2016, due to weaker expectations around iPhone 6 sales, and because they don't see iPhone 7 as a huge hit.

In the latest volley in its high-profile fight with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the Justice Department has appealed a decision that protects the tech giant from unlocking an iPhone in a New York drug case.
Prosecutors, who say Apple has unlocked at least 70 iPhones in the past, are relying on the same "All Writs Act" in a California court, where a judge ordered the company to unlock a device belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters.
The clash has intensified a long-running debate over how much law enforcement and intelligence officials should be able to monitor digital communications.

Stifel's Patrick Newton, hiking his Coherent (COHR +3.2%) target by $18 to $100: "Our research indicates the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supply chain is ramping for OLED production across its portfolio, likely in the 2018 timeframe, requiring a significant investment in OLED hardware, including Coherent’s Excimer Laser Assembly (ELA) Linebeam products." His FY16 (ends Sep. '16) and FY17 EPS estimates have been respectively hiked by $0.15 and $0.20 to $4.40 and $5.25; consensus is at $4.44 and $5.07.
Newton: "We note technologies that use Coherent’s solution, specifically low temperature polysilicon (LTPS), has significantly higher share in OLED production relative to LCD. Our research indicates benefits from the OLED shift extend beyond hardware with the higher utilization of laser discharge units (LDUs) increasing the company’s service revenue relative to LCD, all else equal." He also observes Coherent's OLED-related laser sales carry higher margins than its LCD-related sales.
The note comes five weeks after Coherent reported (along with FQ1 results) strong OLED-related orders for its Linebeam laser systems, and forecast the orders would continue through 2017. It also follows multiple reports indicating Apple plans to use OLEDs in future iPhones - the Nikkei reported of a 2018 ETA.
Universal Display (OLED +5.1%) is going in the same direction as Coherent, much as it did after Coherent's FQ1 report. Shares have more than recovered the losses seen after Universal posted a Q4 miss and issued light 2016 guidance on Feb. 25.

Due to the refusal, Apple must pay $450M, per with the terms of a 2014 settlement with 30+ states. $400M will be paid to e-book buyers, $20M to the states, and $30M to lawyers.

|Mar. 3, 2016, 12:15 PM|Intel reportedly wins portion of iPhone 7 modem orders, lands Baird upgrade


CLSA's Sriji Pajjuri reports supply chain checks indicate Intel (INTC +0.6%) has landed a portion of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 7 baseband modem orders. He estimates the company could supply 30%-40% of the modems going into the device. Pajjuri thinks such a win would boost Intel's revenue and earnings by 1.5%-2%, and respectively hurt current iPhone modem supplier Qualcomm's (QCOM -1.2%) revenue and earnings by 4% and 2%.

VentureBeat reported back in March 2015 Intel's XMM 7360 4G modem (450Mbps peak download speeds) would go into 2016 iPhones aimed at emerging markets. The site followed up in October by stating Intel "now has a thousand people or more" working to get the XMM 7360 designed into an iPhone, and that Apple is interested in eventually developing an SoC pairing a 4G modem with an A-series app processor, with Intel manufacturing the SoC and providing modem IP.
Qualcomm is still viewed as having a modem performance lead on the high-end. The company recently unveiled a modem (the Snapdragon X16) supporting 1Gbps peak download speeds, while adding the chip is expected to go into commercial products in 2H16.
Separately, Baird's Tristan Gerra has upgraded Intel to Outperform, and hiked his target by $5 to $38. He cites healthy DCG (server CPU division) growth and (without naming Apple) the potential for a major "tier-1 smartphone ramp" in 2H16.
Gerra: "After being on the sidelines for a few years on Intel, we think data center has reached sufficient critical mass within Intel's mix to drive a resumption in EPS growth starting in 2017 ... Assuming a low single-digit decline in annual PC revenue and a high single-digit growth rate in data center (below Intel's 15% growth target), DCG mix becomes large enough to drive EPS growth starting in 2017 and in years forward ... We believe Intel's LTE technology has matured, improving Intel's positioning for a potential tier-one smartphone ramp this second half."

The U.S. government cannot force Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to unlock an iPhone in a New York drug case, U.S. Magistrate Judge James Orenstein declared on Monday, a ruling that could affect a similar decision involving the San Bernardino shooter's iPhone in California.
"It would betray our constitutional heritage and our people’s claim to democratic governance for a judge to pretend that our Founders already had that debate, and ended it, in 1789,” Judge Orenstein wrote, referring to the archaic All Writs Act.
The ruling, which will likely shape the broader battle about privacy and security, comes before today's congressional testimony on "San Bernardino" from Apple and the FBI.
|Feb. 26, 2016, 2:33 PM|Cook talks dividend hikes, acquisitions, privacy, car at Apple's annual meeting


Apple (AAPL +0.2%) is committed to raising its quarterly dividend annually, Tim Cook stated at his company's annual meeting. As it is, Apple has been announcing dividend hikes in recent years in tandem with its FQ2 (calendar Q1) report, and CFO Luca Maestri has promised an update to Apple's capital return in tandem with this year's FQ2 report. The quarterly dividend is currently at $0.52/share (2.2% annual yield).

Cook also suggested Apple sees the current environment as a buyer's market for acquiring tech companies. "In times when equity values are falling there's great opportunity to [buy companies]." He added Apple has bought 19 companies in the list 15 months (some purchases are known, some aren't).
Not surprisingly, Cook defended Apple's stance in its battle with the FBI in the San Bernardino case. "We are staunch advocates about our customers’ privacy and personal safety ... We do these things because they are the right thing to do."
When asked about Apple's widely-rumored car efforts, Cook hinted an Apple car could take a while. "Do you remember when you were a kid, and Christmas Eve, it was so exciting, you weren't sure what was going to be downstairs? Well, it's going to be Christmas Eve for a while." The WSJ reported last year Apple is aiming for a 2019 launch date. More recently, AppleInsider reported of a hiring freeze for the project after execs became unhappy with the initiative's progress.
Separately, a federal appeals court (the CAFC) has overturned a $120M infringement ruling against Samsung levied by a jury handling a 2014 patent suit brought by Apple. The court ruled Apple slide-to-unlock and auto-correct patents are invalid, and that Samsung also didn't violate IP related to turning alphanumeric characters into links. The ruling comes after Samsung agreed last December to pay Apple $548M for an infringement ruling in a 2012 case.

9to5 Mac reports Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) next 9.7" iPad will be part of the iPad Pro line rather than an iPad Air 3. Like the 12.9" iPad Pro, the 9.7" model will have an A9X CPU and quad stereo speakers, and likely support Apple's Pencil stylus and Smart Keyboard accessory. Pricing is expected to be "closer in line with the iPad Air models" the smaller iPad Pro will succeed.
9to5 adds Apple will likely discontinue the iPad Mini 2 and first-gen iPad Air. The site previously reported Apple plans to show off a new 9.7" iPad and 4" iPhone at a March 15 event, and begin selling them on March 18. The company is coming off a calendar Q4 in which iPad revenue fell 21% Y/Y to $7.1B, with units dropping 25% to 16.1M.
Meanwhile, Apple has officially filed a motion asking a judge to throw out an order calling on the company to help create a backdoor to unlock an iPhone 5C used by one of the San Bernardino shooters. (the 36-page filing)
In addition to reiterating its argument that creating a backdoor would undermine the security and privacy of all iPhone users, Apple asserts the court order is unconstitutional. "The demand violates Apple’s First Amendment rights against compelled speech and viewpoint discrimination ... The government’s demand also violates Apple’s Fifth Amendment right to be free from arbitrary deprivation of its liberties in that it would conscript Apple to develop software that undermines the security mechanisms of its own products."
The WSJ reports Google, Microsoft, and Facebook plan to file a joint motion supporting Apple, and that Twitter is also in Apple's camp. Yesterday, the NYT reported Apple engineers are working on security measures "that would make it impossible for the government to break into a locked iPhone" using methods similar to the ones sought in the San Bernardino case.

 With Viacom (VIA +1%, VIAB +0.3%) looking to sell a strategic stake in Paramount Pictures, who could be interested in buying? Foreign investors are likely, amid a wave of investment in Hollywood from overseas. China's Perfect World is putting $250M into a development slate at Universal, while in-country counterpart Bona Film Group said in November it was putting $235M into a slate at Fox. Analysts suggest the studio is worth about $5.5B today, notes The Hollywood Reporter, so a minority stake could still come to $2B. Viacom paid $9.8B for the studio a dozen years back. Major conglomerates like Alibaba (BABA +0.6%), Dalian Wanda and Fosun (OTCPK:FOSUF) have an appetite for Hollywood deals -- and Wanda already owns cinema chain AMC and producer Legendary Entertainment, while exploring a stake in Lions Gate. A key interest with those firms is ability to get Paramount products into China, where Transformers is a major phenomenon. Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY +0.2%) has similar international media appetites. Fosun is trying to buy Bona and take it private, which would give it Bona's entry into Fox's slate. Back home, Lions Gate (LGF +8.8%) is now a frequent source of tie-up rumors -- and is on the move today amid Amazon.com (AMZN +0.1%) content-deal chatter. Both Lions Gate and Amazon could use a piece of Paramount for different reasons. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL +1.5%) has been floated as a possible bidder for Time Warner, as it may be shopping for content to feed TV dreams -- but a stake in Paramount would come far cheaper than trying to swallow Time Warner whole for $50B-$80B.

Never shy about sounding off on hot-button issues, Donald Trump has called for a boycott of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) products until the company gives into a government request to help unlock an iPhone 5C used by one of the San Bernardino shooters.
Ironically, Trump's call for a boycott was shortly followed by tweets (regarding Obamacare) that were sent from his iPhone. The Donald explained himself in a subsequent tweet: "I use both iPhone & Samsung. If Apple doesn't give info to authorities on the terrorists I'll only be using Samsung until they give info."
Trump's remarks come after the DOJ filed a motion to compel Apple to comply with a court order to help the FBI crack the shooter's iPhone. Tim Cook has argued creating a backdoor for law enforcement agencies would ultimately put the security and privacy of iPhone users in general at risk, given its potential to be obtained by those with ulterior motives.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been given more time to respond to a government order to assist the FBI in unlocking an iPhone used by the perpetrators of last year's terror attacks in San Bernardino.
Its response in court will now be due February 26 instead of Tuesday.
Apple will likely seek to invoke the United States' protections of free speech as one of its key legal arguments, lawyers with expertise in the subject said this week.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is launching the second largest bond sale of the year as it looks to raise $12B to fund its share buyback plan. What happened to the firm's massive cash pile? Tax deal fallout?
Carl Icahn reduced his stake in the company by 7M shares (to 45.8M shares), according to new SEC filings, while David Einhorn similarly trimmed his holdings in Q4 amid a decline in the value of shares.
Tim Cook is calling a U.S. government order to aid the FBI in breaking into an iPhone (recovered from one of the San Bernardino shooters) as "dangerous, unprecedented and chilling," adding that the Feds want to create a "backdoor" around iPhone encryption.

 Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has filed to sell fixed-rate notes due in 2018, 2019, 2021, 2023, 2026, 2036, and 2046, as well as floating-rate notes due in 2018 and 2019. The size of the offering and its pricing are undetermined for now. (prospectus) CFO Luca Maestri mentioned on last month's FQ1 call (transcript) Apple plans to be "very active in the U.S. international debt markets in 2016, in order to fund our capital return activities. He also noted Apple has finished $153B of its $200B capital return program ($110B via buybacks), and that the company will once more update its program at the time of its April FQ2 report. Apple had $215.7B in cash/investments at the end of FQ1, but $200B was located outside of the U.S. Long-term debt and commercial paper stood at $60.5B.

Ten days after reporting Apple plans to unveil a new 4" iPhone (called the 5se) and the iPad Air 3 on March 15, 9to5 Mac reports Apple (AAPL +0.2%) plans to begin selling the devices online and in retail stores on Friday, March 18. Pre-orders are said to be "unlikely."
The 5se, which could appeal to those partial to smaller iPhones, has been rumored to sport an A9 CPU and M9 motion co-processor, an 8MP rear camera and 1.2MP front camera, and Bluetooth 4.2, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and NFC radios. Air 3 rumors have mentioned a smart connector along with an improved display, speakers, and battery life. Apple disclosed on its FQ1 call 60% of iPhone owners haven't yet upgraded to the 6/6+ or 6S/6S+.
Separately, sources tell The Hollywood Reporter Beats co-founder Dr. Dre is starring in and producing a six-episode TV series called Vital Signs that's being bankrolled by Apple.
The magazine adds Dre's series will likely be distributed via Apple Music (now has over 11M paid subscribers), and that it's not clear if distribution will occur via other platforms such as Apple TV and the iTunes store. The show is said to be a semi-autobiographical "dark drama with no shortage of violence and sex."

Variety reported in September Apple has held initial talks with Hollywood execs about financing original content - a field where Netflix and Amazon have made huge investments. Multiple sites have reported Apple has hatched and (for now) suspended plans to launch an online TV service.

Digitmes reports Asian camera lens makers 'have sent dual-lens camera samples to Apple (AAPL -1.2%) for testing," and that Apple is reportedly planning to include a dual-lens camera within a next-gen iPhone.
Dual lenses can allow users to zoom in without diminishing imaging quality - one lens can be wide-angle, and the other a zoom lens - and also improve low-light performance. Most interestingly, they can also enable depth analysis, which in turn enables features such as 3D image capture, background removal, and automatic blurring.
The report follows Apple's purchase (reported last April) of LinX Computational Imaging, a startup that was working on multi-sensor camera modules promised to deliver SLR-like image quality, superior low-light shots, and the ability to simultaneously take multiple shots at different apertures.
Separately, 9to5 Mac reports Apple plans to hold its expected March event on the 15th (a Tuesday). In-line with past reports, 9to5 states Apple plans to reveal a new 4" iPhone (believed to be called the 5se and feature improved internals), an iPad Air 3, and an Apple Watch software/band update.
The Air 3 is expected to include (per 9to5) an improved camera and speakers, and a smart connector for attaching peripherals. Other reports have indicated the tablet will sport a 4K display and improved battery life.

The FT reports Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) "has assembled a large team of experts in virtual and augmented reality and built prototypes of headsets that could one day rival Facebook's Oculus Rift or Microsoft's HoloLens."
The team is said to include "hundreds of staff from a series of carefully targeted acquisitions, as well as employees poached from companies that are working on next-generation headset technologies." The FT also notes Apple has bought Flyby Media, a developer of software that lets mobile devices "scan" real-world objects and add them to a virtual collection.
The report shortly follows positive earnings call remarks by Tim Cook regarding VR's potential, and the hiring of VR expert Doug Bowman. Motion sensor technology provider PrimeSense was acquired in 2013.
For now, hardware costs and processing demands remain challenges for the budding VR/AR headset market. Facebook has priced its first consumer Oculus Rift model (it's due to ship in March) at $599, and requires the device to be paired with a PC containing a high-end GPU. The much less powerful Gear VR, which uses Samsung phones to power and provide a display for an Oculus VR platform, goes for only $100.

 Energous (NASDAQ:WATT) has risen to $4.98 premarket following an overnight Bloomberg report stating Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is "working with partners in the U.S. and Asia" to develop over-the-air wireless charging technology that could be deployed on its hardware as soon as next year. Energous' name isn't mentioned in the report. However, Bloomberg's description of the technology Apple is working on bears some resemblance to Energous' WattUp; it should be noted others have also been working on OTA wireless charging.
For its part, Energous has said it has a deal with an unnamed tier-1 licensee, and that it aims to "release products to the consumer through our licensing partnerships in late 2016, early 2017." There has been some speculation among bulls the tier-1 licensee is Apple.

Down just moderately after hours in the wake of its mixed FQ1 results and soft FQ2 guidance - some bad news was priced in following chip supplier warnings and iPhone order cut reports - Apple (AAPL -4.5%) is seeing steeper losses today. Several chip suppliers are also off.
Not surprisingly, many on the Street are nervous about earnings call remarks regarding macro pressures in general, and Chinese pressures in particular. However, bulls are also taking heart in Apple's efforts to highlight services growth - reported FQ1 services revenue rose 26% Y/Y to $6.1B, and Apple asserts its installed base drove nearly $9B in related purchases (+24% Y/Y). With revenue guided to drop 9%-14% Y/Y in FQ2, future iPhone growth is also the subject of much debate.
Macquarie's Ben Schachter (Outperform, $117 target): "The company rang the alarm bells loud and clear on macro weakness ... Cook put something of a line in the sand in implying that the March qtr would be the trough for iPhone unit growth ... the new disclosures confirm our thesis that the % of profit contribution from Services is almost 2x its % of revs, i.e., Services should contribute almost 20% of profits in FY’16 despite representing only about 10% of revs."
Deutsche's Sherri Scribner (Hold, $105 target): "We remain concerned about the lack of growth in iPhone units this year, the slowdown in China sales, and gross margin pressure from FX as we move through the year ... With AAPL becoming a recurring revenue story, we expect the valuation to rerate in line with other mature, services-type companies."
Susquehanna's Chris Caso (Positive, $140 target): "We think the question about whether iPhone can grow was, however, a more relevant argument when the stock was higher. With the stock at its current level (AAPL’s free cash flow yield is now in excess of 10%), we think the more relevant question now is whether iPhone can continue to generate cash at similar levels over a reasonable investment horizon ... Nonetheless, what’s ultimately needed for AAPL to be viewed as a growth stock once again is for them to once again simply invent something new that will have the impact of the iPod, iPhone or iPad." (ed: could an electric car do the job?)
Other opinions: 1) Jan Dawson still sees plenty of room to cross-sell new products/services to a base of 1B+ active users. 2) VentureBeat's Chris O'Brien thinks more transparency is needed on Apple Watch/Apple TV sales and services revenue (among other things). 3) 9to5 Mac's Ben Lovejoy argues it's time for Apple might need to rethink iPhone pricing in light of macro/forex pressures and competition.
On SA, Bill Maurer notes Apple disclosed 60% of iPhone owners haven't upgraded to an iPhone 6/6+ or 6S/6S+, and that a rumored new 4" iPhone could appeal to some of them. Paulo Santos, on the other hand, is skeptical a new 4" iPhone will provide a big lift, and considers FQ1's 25% Y/Y iPad unit drop "more serious than it looks."

In its supplemental slides (.pdf), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) notes forex had a 600 bps impact on FQ1 revenue growth (2% vs. 8%). The effect was particularly strong in Europe (+4% vs. +18%) and Rest of Asia-Pac (excludes China/Japan, +4% vs. +19%).
On the earnings call, Tim Cook noted Apple has seen economic turbulence in China/Hong Kong - Intel has also reported seeing Chinese macro pressures. Cook insists Apple remains bullish on China, and predicts rising 4G penetration will continue lifting iPhone sales. 50% of Chinese iPhone sales are said to be to first-time buyers. (live blogs: WSJ, Business Insider)
Notably, when asked about virtual realty, Cook suggested he's positive on the technology. "I don’t think it’s a niche. I think it can be … it’s really cool and has some interesting applications." Apple recently hired VR expert Doug Bowman; Facebook is getting set to ship its first consumer Oculus Rift model, and Google/Alphabet has created a dedicated VR unit.
When asked about iPhone ASP, CFO Luca Maestri suggested a favorable mix gave a lift - demand for 5.5" iPhones and higher storage tiers could be helping. Regarding forex, Maestri said Apple expects a 4% FQ2 revenue hit, and sees sales dropping 5%-10% Y/Y in constant currency (implies a 9%-14% drop in dollars). Forex had a $49 impact on FQ1 iPhone ASP ($691 vs. $740).
Also mentioned: 1) iPhone channel inventory was at the low end of Apple's target range at the end of FQ1, and iPad channel inventory within its target range. 2) App Store revenue rose 27% Y/Y, and App Store customers 18%. 3) Apple plans to update its capital return plan next quarter, and to be active in debt markets.

Among the new features: An 8MP rear camera and 1.2MP front camera (same as the iPhone 6's); an NFC chip/Apple Pay support (likely a positive for NFC chip supplier NXPI); the iPhone 6's A8 CPU and M8 motion co-processor (NXPI supplies the latter); Bluetooth 4.2 and 802.11ac Wi-Fi; and the iPhone 6S' Live Photos feature.
3D Touch won't be supported, and the current 5S will be discontinued. The 5se is said to already be in production, and due to be unveiled at Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported March event "ahead of a late March or early April release."
Gurman also reports the Apple Watch refresh expected at the March event will involve additional band color options and bands featuring new materials, with a full hardware revamp waiting until the fall.

The Beats 1 station will be Apple's only free Web radio service going forward. Ad-free radio streams will still be provided via the Apple Music subscription service; Apple didn't state whether the iTunes Match service will continue supporting ad-free iTunes Radio.
The news comes ahead of Pandora's Feb. 11 Q4 report. Shares jumped last month after the CRB announced better-than-feared recording royalty rates for 2016-2020, but gave back their gains and then some as markets tumbled.
After opening sharply higher, Pandora has quickly pared its gains. The Nasdaq is up 1%.

"The iAd App Network will be discontinued as of June 30, 2016," Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) states on its developer site. "Although we are no longer accepting new apps into the network, advertising campaigns may continue to run and you can still earn advertising revenue until June 30." The App Network, one part of the iAd platform, allows developers to promote their App Store apps across iAd's publisher network
The news follows a BuzzFeed report stating Apple plans to phase out iAd's sales force, while allowing publishers to directly sell ads through a programmatic (automated) ad-buying platform and keep 100% of generated revenue. BuzzFeed suggested the move could be a negative for The Rubicon Project (NYSE:RUBI) and other ad tech firms Apple has partnered with to enable programmatic iAd buys.
iAd, launched in 2010, has served ads on iOS devices, Macs, and PCs. Tim Cook has suggested Apple's main goal with the platform is to help developers make money, rather than create a major new revenue source. The business has faced stiff competition from rivals such as Google's AdMob unit and Facebook's Audience Network.

Update: Some other Apple news: As of Jan. 28, Apple will no longer support free/ad-supported iTunes Radio. Ad-free stations will be provided via Apple Music. There's no indication yet that iTunes Match's support for ad-free iTunes Radio will be going away.

IDC estimates global PC shipments fell 10.6% Y/Y in Q4 to 71.9M, just a slightly smaller drop than Q3's 10.8%. Gartner is once more a little less downbeat, estimating shipments fell 8.3% to 75.7M.
For the whole of 2015, IDC estimates shipments fell 10.4% to 276.2M. The firm notes adding detachable tablets to its count would respectively provide ~6% and ~3% boosts to Q4 and 2015 growth rates.
The Q4 figures suggest Windows 10 (available as a free upgrade to Windows 7/8 users) and Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Skylake CPU launch provided only a modest sales lift. IDC: "The PC market continued to face persistent challenges [in 2015] from longer-PC lifecycles and competition from mobile phones and tablets, despite the slowing growth in those markets. However, economic issues like falling commodity prices and weak international currencies, as well as social disruptions in EMEA and Asia/Pacific that disrupted foreign markets were a larger factor for 2015."
IDC VP Loren Loverde still thinks PC replacement rates will pick up in 2016. "Commercial adoption of Windows 10 (NASDAQ:MSFT) is expected to accelerate, and consumer buying should also stabilize by the second half of the year. Most PC users have delayed an upgrade, but can only maintain this for so long before facing security and performance issues." Counting detachable tablets, IDC expects 1%-2% 2016 growth. Gartner forecasts a 1% decline.
Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) remained the PC market's top player: IDC estimates Lenovo's shipment share rose 140 bps Y/Y in Q4 to 21.4%. #2 HP's (NYSE:HPQ) share rose 10 bps to 19.9%. #3 Dell's rose 70 bps to 14.1%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Asus (OTC:AKCPF) were tied at #4 with 7.9% shares - Apple's share rose 110 bps, and Asus' 90 bps. Apple's revenue share could be closer to 15%. Non-top 5 vendors, hurt by their relative lack of scale, collectively saw their shipment share drop 420 bps to 28.7%

Believing investors are too focused on near-term pressures, Mizuho's Abhey Lamba has upgraded Apple (AAPL +1.3%) to Buy ahead of its Jan. 26 FQ1 report, while cutting his target by $5 to $120. He downgraded a year ago, when Apple was at a dividend-adjusted $107.96.
Lamba: "We recognize the recent flurry of bad news from the iPhone supply chain, lackluster iPhone sell through, and fully understand the concerns presented by slowdown in China. However ... we think extrapolating current data points to eternity is neither fair to the company nor an appropriate way to value Apple as an investment" Though believing FQ1/FQ2 results could miss consensus, he praises Apple's customer loyalty following a survey of 1,000 people, and estimates the average iPhone buyer has a discounted lifetime value of $1,207.
Deutsche's Sherri Scribner (downgraded to Hold back in Oct. 2014) has cut her target by $20 to $105. Citing recent negative datapoints, she now sees iPhone shipments dropping 4% in FY16 to 222M. Oppenheimer's Andrew Uerkwitz (Outperform rating) has cut his target by $35 to $120, and is worried the smartphone market is starting to resemble the PC market. "In other words, the smartphone market will no longer see easy [year-over-year] growth,"
Susquehanna's Chris Caso (Positive rating) has cut his target by $15 to $140, but sees investor attention shifting to the iPhone 7 launch soon. Brean's Ananda Baruah (Buy, $170 target) is aggressively defending Apple, arguing the implications of recent supply chain datapoints aren't as "draconian" as believed. "We continue to believe that Street EPS [consensus] is materially low through ’17 from 1) potentially greater phone ships, 2) ongoing favorable [gross margin] from both iPhones and iPhone mix and 3) greater Opex $ leverage through at least ’16."
Apple is up moderately following the reports. Shares go for 10.7x trailing EPS of $9.22. $142B in net cash ($26/share, much of it offshore) was on the balance sheet as of Sep. 26.

9to5 Mac, which has been fairly reliable with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) product scoops, reports Apple plans to launch a pair of fully wireless Bluetooth Beats headphones (no cable connecting the right and left earbuds), potentially at the same time the iPhone 7 launches. The product stands to be the first major new headphone launch from Beats since Apple bought the company in 2014.
9to5 adds the headphones are expected to come with a portable charging case, and feature a noise-cancelling microphone system that enables calls and Siri commands without an in-line mic or remote. It also joins other sites in reporting the iPhone 7 won't feature a standard 3.5mm headphone jack - headphone users will have to rely either on Bluetooth or a Lightning connector, perhaps with a 3.5mm adapter attached. A petition asking Apple to keep the 3.5mm jack has amassed over 200K signatures.
Regarding the iPhone 7, sources tell 9to5 Apple is still testing three different designs, including "a completely new, thinner look as well as a backup design that looks substantially like the iPhone 6S."
iPhone/iPad audio codec chip supplier Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS) might also be a supplier for the wireless headphones. Earlier today, Pac Crest (upgraded Cirrus) reported hearing from headphone makers the use of a digital connector such as Lightning both improves sound quality and allows them to embed a smart codec chip within their headphones.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has bought Emotient, a startup that relies on a form of A.I. known as deep learning to decipher human emotions via facial expressions. Emotient has mostly worked with advertisers to help them gauge consumer reactions to their ads, but many other use cases for its technology are also possible,
This is the third A.I.-related Apple acquisition to be reported in the last three months. The company has also bought Perceptio, a company working on A.I.-based image-recognition systems for smartphones that don't need to heavily access cloud data, and VocalIQ, creator of an A.I.-based platform for creating personal assistants that can understand natural-language queries and commands.
Google and Facebook have been making big A.I. investments themselves, aiming to use the technology for everything from detecting faces to tagging photos to analyzing websites and apps to make content recommendations. Like Google Now, Siri and Apple's Proactive assistant leverage A.I.
Meanwhile, iPhone chip suppliers Qorvo and Cirrus Logic have each issued calendar Q4 warnings after the bell, and suggested Q1 sales will also be soft. Without naming customers, both companies blame weak mobile product sales; Cirrus received 63% of its calendar Q3 sales from Apple.
The warnings come shortly after the Nikkei and the WSJ reported of iPhone-related order cuts. Apple fell 4.2% in regular trading amid a 3% Nasdaq drop, and is down 0.7% after hours to $95.81 following Qorvo/Cirrus' warnings.

Revenue is expected to be flat Q/Q in FQ4. Consensus is at $641.9M. "Above-market revenue growth" is forecast for calendar 2016. FQ3 results are due on Feb. 4.
Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS) now expects FQ3 revenue of $347M, below prior guidance of $370M-$400M and a $386M consensus. Cirrus: "Our preliminary revenue results reflect weaker than anticipated demand for certain portable audio products. This weakness escalated over the last few weeks of December and is expected to continue to significantly impact our revenue in the March quarter."
The audio codec developer still expects "meaningful" FY16 (ends March '16) revenue growth, and expects several new product launches to drive strong FY17 growth. FQ3 results arrive on Jan. 27.
Both Qorvo and Cirrus are iPhone suppliers, with Cirrus getting well over half its revenue from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The warnings follow multiple reports indicating Apple has cut iPhone-related orders. Cirrus has dropped to $24.52 after hours.

Nearly $40B had been paid out to developers over the App Store's lifetime, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) discloses in this year's holiday season App Store PR. With Apple getting a 30% cut on App Store transactions, $40B in payouts would equal $57.1B in gross revenue and $17.1B in net revenue.
Over $20B was spent through the App Store in 2015 ($6B+ cut for Apple), up from ~$15B in 2014. Over $1.1B was spent on apps and in-app purchases during the two weeks ending Jan. 3 (a busy period due to Christmas gift unwrapping).
Though Google Play's download rates have long surpassed the App Store's, favorable demographics and Apple's requirement that a credit card # be supplied to set up an iTunes account have led the App Store to maintain a healthy monetization edge, which in turn leads many developers to still write for iOS first and Android second. App Annie estimates the App Store produced 80% more revenue than Google Play in Q3, even as Google Play produced 90% more downloads.

AAPL -2% premarket to $100.70. Nasdaq futures are also down 2%.

Update (9:50AM ET): A day after the Nikkeir's iPhone production cut report, Rosenblatt Securities' Jun Zhang has downgraded Apple to Neutral on iPhone sales concerns. "We believe iPhone 6S sales have slowed down during the holiday season reaching high market inventory levels. Therefore, we believe iPhone production has been reduced again in the past two weeks to 43M units for the March quarter. Now, we expect March quarter iPhone sales to be around 45-46M, considering enough inventory in the retailing channels ... Normally, iPhone sales resume normal seasonality in the June quarter, but it is in our view that the overall China smartphone market is slowing down to flattish YoY growth in 2016, which will affect iPhone sales growth in China. We do not believe India will become a meaningful iPhone market in the short-term." Apple is down 1%, matching the Nasdaq's drop.

The paper adds Apple initially told component suppliers to keep production even with that seen for the iPhone 6/6+ a year ago, but has seen 6S/6S+ inventories pile up "at retailers in markets ranging from China and Japan to Europe and the U.S." In December, Apple sold off after long-time bull Morgan Stanley forecast (in response to checks) iPhone unit sales will drop 6% in FY16 (ends in September), and added to its losses after Dialog Semi (gets over half its sales from Apple) issued a Q4 warning. In November, Credit Suisse reported of component order cuts. Apple is trading near $103 following the Nikkei's report.

When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published new guidelines 18 months ago regarding the radiation risk from cellphones, it used unusually bold language: "We recommend caution in cellphone use."
Within weeks, though, the CDC reversed course. It no longer recommended caution, and deleted a passage specifically addressing potential risks for children.
Mainstream scientific consensus currently holds that there is little to no evidence that cellphone signals raise the risk of brain cancer or other health problems. Nevertheless, more than 500 pages of internal records obtained by NYT, along with interviews with former agency officials, reveal a debate and some disagreement among scientists and health agencies about what guidance to give as the use of mobile devices skyrockets.

It adds the companies plan to spend a combined KRW15T ($12.8B) in capex over the next 2-3 years to expand their OLED capacity, and that (in-line with past deals with suppliers) Apple will likely provide some funding to help the companies with their investments. Samsung will likely get bigger order volumes than LG.
The report follows one from Japan's Nikkei a month ago stating Apple will launch iPhones featuring OLEDs in 2018, and that the company will work with suppliers "over the next year or so" to see if it can obtain enough displays and eliminate technical issues such as performance degradation.

Jeff Williams, formerly Apple's (AAPL -0.3%) SVP of operations, has been promoted to the role of COO. Tim Cook, who was COO before becoming CEO: "Jeff is hands-down the best operations executive I've ever worked with."
Marketing SVP Phil Schiller will now also have responsibility for the App Store, previously the domain of Internet software/services chief Eddy Cue. Schiller will "focus on strategies to extend the ecosystem Apple customers have come to love," and now "leads nearly all developer-related functions at Apple."
Also: 1) Hardware technologies VP Johny Srouji, responsible for overseeing chip engineering, has been named an SVP. 2) Tor Myhren, formerly an exec at ad/marketing agency Grey Group, has been named Apple's VP of marketing communications.

In what would be a first-ever negative print, Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty sees calendar year iPhone sales declining by about 3% in 2016. Noting weak smartphone supply chain data points, she's cutting her 2016 iPhone units estimate by 12% and EPS estimate by 6%.
It was only about two months ago when Huberty boosted her estimate of iPhone sales growth next year to 7% from 3%.
Huberty still rates Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) an Overweight, but she trims the price target by $9 to $143.

|Dec. 10, 2015, 10:23 AM|GoPro up 3.7% after FBR speculates Apple could buy company (updated)


"We believe an acquisition of GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) would make sense for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL); action cameras are uniquely positioned at the intersection of Apple’s smartphone, wearables, and multimedia offerings," writes FBR's Daniel Ives in a note about potential Apple buyout targets.
Ives: "Additionally, GoPro’s new product cycles could open the door to areas where Apple’s competitors are investing heavily (e.g., drones, VR), and Cupertino has been playing catch-up. We also see strategic value in GoPro being integrated with Apple’s strong multimedia ecosystem (e.g., iTunes, Apple TV, etc.)."
Media/ad software giant Adobe (ADBE - $44.4B market cap), enterprise cloud storage/file-sharing leader Box (BOX - $1.6B market cap), and EV/battery maker Tesla (TSLA - $30B market cap) are also named as potential Apple targets. "Box would give Apple an avenue into enterprise storage and enable it to expand its product tentacles (hardware/storage) into the enterprise cloud frontier ... Adobe would provide a nice pipeline into the enterprise ... Adobe’s Document Cloud/Marketing Cloud applications are helping enterprises grapple with the growth of digital marketing, proliferation of mobile devices in the enterprise, and IOT."
The GoPro remarks come with the action camera leader down 82% from its Oct. 2014 high of $98.47, and sporting a $2.4B market cap. In other news, GoPro announced today it has added Apple Watch support for its iOS app.

|Dec. 8, 2015, 10:29 PM|Bloomberg: Apple suspends TV service plans as big media resists (updated)



Bloomberg reports Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has suspended plans to offer an online TV service, and will focus for now on helping media companies directly sell content via the App Store.
The news service adds Apple isn't completely giving up on providing a live TV service, but notes its original plan to sell 14 or so channels for $30-$40/month has "run into resistance from media companies that want more money for their programming." Media execs have said they expect Apple and other new entrants pay more per channel than pay-TV incumbents.
The report comes shortly after CBS CEO Les Moonves stated Apple had put its online TV service plans "on hold." Moonves still expects Apple to eventually offer such a service. "It has four major networks and 10 cable networks, let’s say, and the price point will be in the $30s, $30 to $35, $40 maybe. People will not be spending money on channels they don’t want to watch."

In August, Bloomberg reported Apple was looking to launch a TV service selling for ~$40/month in 2016, after previously aiming for a 2015 launch. The WSJ and Re/code have also reported of TV service plans, while Variety has reported of talks with Hollywood studios to finance original content.
Dish and Sony have launched online TV services this year, and Amazon has been rumored to be thinking of joining the fray. Apple, meanwhile, recently rolled out a next-gen Apple TV set-top featuring App Store, gaming, and Siri support.

Earlier: Apple reportedly plans March Apple Watch event

Update (12/9): Re/code backs up Bloomberg, stating Apple "has walked away from the negotiating table with the TV guys." It adds media execs are at odds with Apple not only over per-channel pricing, but Apple's insistence on providing a relatively cheap "skinny bundle" limited to a core set of channels. Apple media chief Eddy Cue has reportedly proposed selling value-added programming tiers on top of the skinny bundle.

It's been a rough run for value stocks over the past few years, but the metric used to determine value - price/book - may not be the right one, says Citi's Robert Buckland. Free-cash-flow yield is better, he argues. noting this metric tracked traditional value in the 1990s and 2000s, but has easily outperformed over the past decade.
It's a sign of the times, he says, as FCF is a "capex-suspicious metric," and investors are concerned about the economic outlook, and cynical about capital allocation decisions of managements.

|Dec. 8, 2015, 12:38 PM|Apple reportedly plans March Apple Watch event; iPhone battery case launched



9to5 Mac (pretty accurate historically in reporting about Apple events) reports Apple (AAPL -0.6%)  plans to hold a March event to reveal a next-gen Apple Watch. It adds a  4" iPhone 6C (the subject of many recent rumors) could also debut.

In June, 9to5 reported an Apple Watch 2 is expected to have a FaceTime video camera, and will be able to receive data solely through its Wi-Fi radio (eliminating the need for iPhone pairing).  IDC recently estimated Apple shipped 3.9M Watches in Q3, up from 3.6M in Q2.
Separately Apple has launched a $99 Smart Battery Case, the first iPhone battery case to be created by Apple itself. The silicone case, which competes with offerings from Anker, Mophie, and other 3rd-party suppliers, works with the iPhone 6 and 6S (but not the 6+ and 6S+), and promises to boost talk to up to 25 hours and 4G Internet use to up to 18 hours. It's slimmer than many rival products, but has a protruding battery on the back.
The case is differentiated in part via hardware integration: Users can find out how much battery life remains for both the case and their iPhone's battery through the lock screen (thus removing the need for LED indicator case lights), the case charges and passes through data via standard Lightning cables, and antennas have been integrated to prevent the case from degrading cellular performance.
Reviews are mixed: The WSJ's Joanna Stern likes the iPhone integration and form factor, but observes many rival cases provide more juice for less cost. A $40 Anker case boosts battery life by 124%, more than the Smart Battery Case's 80%.
Engadget's Chris Velazco: "Apple's first battery case works, and it works well. Here's the rub, though: There are plenty of cheaper, more capacious options, and some of those are prettier too. What the Smart Battery Case offers over its rivals is a sense of cohesiveness that stems from Apple controlling both the hardware and software experience."

Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) will make a $548M payment to Apple by Dec. 14 related to Apple's (AAPL +3.1%) much-publicized 2012 legal win in a California federal court. Apple had previously been awarded $930M, but an appeals court removed $382M in trade dress dilution damages in May.
Nonetheless, in a joint case statement, Samsung says it "reserves all rights to reclaim or obtain reimbursement" for its payout should the judgment against it be "reversed, modified, vacated or set aside on appeal or otherwise, including as a result of any proceedings before the USPTO addressing the patents at issue."
Naturally, Apple "disputes Samsung's asserted rights to reimbursement." Samsung has successfully challenged the validity of an Apple pinch-to-zoom patent (the '915 patent) asserted in the case at the USPTO - Apple has appealed the USPTO's decision to a federal circuit court - and has hinted it could appeal the Apple case to the Supreme Court. However, the S.C. only hears a small portion of appealed cases.
Apple and Samsung have already agreed to drop their non-U.S. legal disputes. Meanwhile, Apple's May 2014 settlement with Motorola Mobility sparked hopes of a deal with Samsung.
Samsung's payment is equal to less than 0.1% of Apple's current market cap of $662B. Apple is rallying on a day the Nasdaq is up 1.9%.

 KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo, who has a good track record when it comes to sharing specs for future Apple (AAPL -0.6%) products (and a mixed track record regarding launch dates/pricing), reports a new 4" iPhone (expected to be called the 6C) will launch next year. The phone, which could replace the 5S as Apple's entry-level model and appeal to those who prefer the smaller form factors of older iPhones, is said to feature an A9 CPU (like the 6S/6S+), a metal case (unlike the plastic 5C), an NFC radio/Apple Pay support, and a camera similar to the iPhone 5S'. 3D Touch support isn't expected. Kuo thinks shipments will start in early 2016, potentially ahead of a March/April launch. He estimates the device will sell for $400-$500 - the 6S and 6S+ respectively start at $649 and $749 unsubsidized. Cowen reported a year ago Apple is working on a new 4" iPhone. More recently, a Chinese site reported a metal 4" iPhone would arrive in early 2016. In other news, IDC estimates Apple Watch shipments totaled 3.9M in Q3, up 300K Q/Q and good for an 18.6% wearable unit share (revenue share is likely higher). Market leader Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) had an estimated 22.2% share via 4.7M shipments, and #3 Xiaomi a 17.4% share via 3.7M shipments.

"Apple (AAPL +0.5%) probably had the strongest Friday sales in its entire history,” says Global Equities' Trip Chowdhry, taking note of the company's "strategic shift in selling." In a very short time, says Chowdhry, the company has quadrupled its expert salesforce, with the result being far more retail locations offering the same sort of expertise usually found at Apple stores.
As for holiday promotions, Apple has none in its own stores (other than price-matching), but allows other retailers to offer deals.
Getting down to specific products, the iPhone and Apple Watch were the most popular ones, with the Watch likely the number seller online. IPads are emerging as the first computing device for kids, with the iPad Air 2 the hottest gift item for kids eight and older, the Mini for those younger.

Japan's Nikkei reports Apple (AAPL -0.5%) will launch iPhones sporting OLED displays starting in 2018. To date, the company has exclusively used LCDs for its retina displays.
The paper adds securing enough OLEDs to meet Apple's needs (the company sells over 200M iPhones/year) could be difficult, and that Apple will "work over the next year or so" with suppliers to see if it can obtain enough displays and eliminate technical drawbacks such as performance degradation.
iPhone LCD supplier LG Display (LPL +6.9%), which has already unveiled plans to invest ~$8.5B in OLED manufacturing through 2018, is said to be "planning capacity upgrades." OLED materials/IP provider Universal Display (OLED +5.2%) have caught a bid on the Nikkei's report; LPL was already higher on the day.
OLEDs have long been a staple on Samsung's Galaxy S and Note lines. Supporters of the technology praise its high contrast/deep blacks and potential thickness and power consumption advantages. Apple, however, has argued its LCDs provide superior color accuracy.
There have long been rumors Apple is thinking of adopting OLEDs. The company recently filed a patent application for an integrated OLED display and touch panel, with a fingerprint reader located underneath.

 Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expecting to bring Apple Pay to China as soon as February, Dow Jones is reporting. Sources told The Wall Street Journal that the company has made deals with China's big four state-run banks, which will allow linked banked accounts. Still unclear, the report says, is what transactions will cost there or what regulatory hurdles are yet ahead. Apple is reportedly hoping to launch the service before Feb. 8 and the Spring Festival. In other headwinds, China UnionPay holds a monopoly on credit and debit processing, while private-sector e-payments are dominated by Alibaba's Alipay, and Tencent's WeChat. The tech giant had launched its payment system in the UK in July, its first foray outside the U.S. At that time, it had plans in place to extend the system to China, South Korea and Canada, and has moved to Canada and Australia since the summer. |Nov. 20, 2015, 5:17 PM|Jury rules Apple didn't infringe Pendrell patents; Pendrell halted

Universal Display (OLED +9.6%) is up 17% over the last two days. Possibly helping: The USPTO has published a patent application from Apple (has long been the subject of rumors it's testing/thinking of using OLEDs) for an integrated OLED display and touch panel, with a fingerprint reader underneath.
In the application, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) states integrating an OLED stack and touch sensors on a silicon substrate "can allow for an extremely high number of pixels per inch," and that arranging OLED sub-pixels side-by-side with touch sensors "can also lead to a wider viewing angle display with a higher contrast ratio, higher brightness, and more vibrant colors without compromising touch sensitivity."
Also: Reuters has published an article highlighting LG's recent OLED TV price cuts, made possible by recent production improvements and plant investments. Two sets now sell for less than $2K. LG Display (LPL +3.2%) recently promised to invest at least KRW10T ($8.5B) in OLED manufacturing through 2018.
Universal jumped two weeks ago after beating Q3 estimates and narrowing its full-year guidance. Shares are at their highest levels since August.

Update: Also of note: Korea's Digital Times reports LG Display plans to invest (perhaps using the funds previously allocated for OLED expansion) up to $4.2B to build a new OLED plant in Paju, South Koirea. The plant is expected to go into production in the 2017-2018 timeframe.

The WSJ reports Apple (AAPL -0.4%) is talking with JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and other banks about launching a P2P mobile payments service that would be linked with Apple Pay, and compete with PayPal's (PYPL -1.4%) Venmo service. Users would be able to "zap payments from their checking accounts to recipients through their Apple devices." A 2016 launch is reportedly possible.
Any revenue collected by Apple from the service would likely be tiny for a company of its size - Apple reportedly gets $0.15 for every $100 of credit transactions done via Apple Pay, and half a cent on Apple Pay debit transactions. The primary goal, rather, would be to provide another service that helps keep users loyal to Apple's ecosystem.
PayPal has fallen moderately in response. The lion's share of the company's transaction volume comes from merchant payments (where Apple, Amazon, and others already compete) rather than P2P. Facebook and Google have dabbled in P2P payments via services attached to Messenger and Gmail/Google Wallet.
Separately, iPad Pro reviews have arrived.

After finishing after hours trading nearly flat in the wake of its FQ4 beat and in-line FQ1 guidance, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is higher in morning trading. Possibly helping out: Pac Crest's Andy Hargreaves, who downgraded last year shortly following the iPhone 6 launch, has upgraded to Overweight and set a $142 target.
Hargreaves: "Expectations for the 6S cycle have fallen and we see March as the low point for growth ... We see Apple as a sustained share gainer in [smartphones] with pricing that is likely to remain protected by Apple’s brand, ecosystem and the extraordinary utility of the iPhone." He now expects 75.9M FQ1 iPhone sales, up slightly from 74.5M a year earlier.
FBR's Daniel Ives (Outperform, $175 target): "Apple investors were bracing for the worst and hoping for the best, and they ultimately received a B+ quarter/guide that was better than feared ... With Cook & Co. forecasting year-over-year iPhone unit growth off Herculean comps in the December quarter with China remaining white hot, we believe last night was a major step in turning the positive tide around the Apple story."
BTIG's Walter Piecyk (Buy, $160 target): "Tim Cook also indicated that iPhone units would grow, which should be welcome news to investors after recent soft commentary from US wireless operators about upgrade rates ... we continue to expect Apple to generate $10 in EPS in Fiscal 2016, reflecting 8% EPS growth, thanks to the continued aggressive share repurchase."
Mizuho's Abhey Lamba (Neutral, $125 target): "While [iPhone] shipments were relatively inline, ASP of $670 was significantly better than consensus of $649 resulting in a meaningful upside to the segment’s revenue. iPads in the meantime continue to decline with the quarter’s unit and revenue drop being ~20% Y/Y. While management does not disclose Watch sales, they were likely in the 3.0-3.5 million units range vs consensus of 3.75 million units."

Prior Apple coverage, earnings call transcript

|Oct. 27, 2015, 7:11 PM|Apple's call: Chinese iPhone sales, forex, iPad, Android switching discussed


FQ4 iPhone (NASDAQ:AAPL) sales rose 120% Y/Y in mainland China (driving 99% total Greater China revenue growth), CFO Luca Maestri mentioned on the earnings call. Meanwhile, Tim Cook insisted Chinese macro conditions remain good, and talked up the potential for middle class growth and rising 4G penetration to boost iPhone sales in China and other Asian markets. Over 50% of Chinese iPhone buyers were first-time buyers.
Also mentioned by Cook: A strong dollar is expected to have a 700 bps impact on FQ1 revenue growth, after having an 800 bps impact in FQ4. With last year's iPhone 6 launch yielding tougher comps, FQ1 guidance implies 1%-4% Y/Y revenue growth (8%-11% exc. forex), down from FQ4's 22%. Cook expresses confidence iPhone sales will rise Y/Y, and sees smartphone upgrade programs (both Apple's and carriers') shortening upgrade cycles.
Maestri defends the iPad (revenue -20% Y/Y in FQ4), stating sell-through was 10.3M units (above sell-in of 9.9M, but still down from year-ago sell-in of 12.3M) as channel inventories fell, and that Apple has 73% of the $200+ segment of the U.S. tablet market. Customer satisfaction is said to be at 97%.
Also mentioned: 1) 30% of iPhone buyers upgrading an existing smartphone are believed to be former Android users. 2) The recently-launched Apple News has 40M users. 3) Apple's enterprise sales of $25B over the last 12 months (previously disclosed) reflects ~40% Y/Y growth. 4) App Store revenue rose 25% Y/Y. 5) Apple Watch shipments rose Q/Q, and are expected to rise again in FQ1. However, no specific numbers are given. 6) 15 acquisitions were made in FY15 (only some are known).

Dialog Semiconductor (OTC:DLGNF), which supplies power management chips for the iPhone/iPad and counts Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as its largest customer, is down 18.4% in Frankfurt after posting Q3 results.
Dialog's Q3 revenue rose 18% Y/Y in Q3 to $330M, after having risen 44% in Q2 thanks to strong iPhone 6-related demand. The company forecasts Q4 revenue of $430M-$460M, a range that implies Y/Y growth of -1% to +6%.
Apple is selling off ahead of tomorrow afternoon's FQ4 report, as are various chip suppliers. The Nasdaq is down 0.2%. Shares +6% YTD and trading for 11.8x an FY16 (ends Sep. '16) EPS consensus of $9.80.

Update: RBC's Amit Daryanani (Outperform rating, $150 target on Apple) observes Dialog's Q3 revenue missed a $354M consensus, and that its Q4 guidance is below a $475M consensus. He thinks the numbers are negative for Apple "given our discussions with [Dialog] management, which suggest ASPs are up ~4-5% (implying AAPL units being flat to down 2% in Dec-qtr)." He qualifies the remarks by noting inventory and supply chain dynamics can affect the relationship between Dialog's sales to Apple and Apple's own sales.

 Apple (AAPL +3.1%) is nearing the release of its Android app for Apple Music, judging from a German mobile site that has gotten hold of screenshots and says some users are in private beta. It would mark just the second time the company officially released an Android app -- and the other one was a tool to migrate data to iOS devices from Android devices. The company had said in its June launch that an Android app for Apple Music would be coming at some point this fall. On Tuesday, Apple chief Tim Cook said Apple Music had 15M users, 6.5M of which were paying subscribers.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) "now has a thousand people or more working to outfit a 2016 iPhone" with its XMM 7360 2G/3G/4G modem, sources tell VentureBeat. It adds Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may dual-source its 2016 iPhone modems via Intel and current supplier Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).
That meshes with a March VentureBeat report stating the XMM 7360 will go into 2016 iPhones aimed at emerging markets. Though an August Northland Securities report forecast Intel will supply modems for some iPhone 6S/6S+ units, teardowns indicate Apple is solely relying on Qualcomm's MDM9635M modem.
The MDM9635M supports 300Mbps peak download speeds, and the XMM 7360 450Mbps peak speeds. Qualcomm, whose high-end modems are generally considered to have a performance/power consumption edge, recently unveiled the X12, which supports 600Mbps peak speeds and will be integrated with its Snapdragon 820 processor.
Also: VentureBeat reports Apple would like to eventually develop an SoC that features both an A-series app processor and a 4G modem, and which would be manufactured using Intel's 14nm process. The site also suggests Apple is interested in Intel's 10nm process (due in 2017).
Intel would provide modem IP for the SoC in addition to manufacturing the chip. To date, Intel has paired discrete A-series processors manufactured by Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and TSMC (NYSE:TSM) with 3rd-party modems (in recent years, Qualcomm's). Intel recently bought 3G CDMA modem assets (needed to service Verizon, Sprint, China Telecom, and certain other carriers) from Taiwan's VIA Telecom.

Apple's (AAPL -0.7%) 4K 21.5" iMac, rumored to be on the way, runs on a 5th-gen Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) CPU (Broadwell) and an integrated Iris Pro GPU, and sells for $1,499. Non-4K (1080p) 21.5" models sell for $1,099 and $1,299.
The company's 5K 27" iMacs now sport 6th-gen Intel CPUs (Skylake, recently launched) and AMD R9 GPUs, and sell for $1,799, $1,999, and $2,299; they previously started at $1,999. Non-5K 27" iMacs are being dropped from Apple's lineup.
The 4K/5K iMac displays are said to sport a wider color gamut, and all iMacs now come with two Thunderbolt 2 (20Gbps) ports. Meanwhile, Apple has launched three new peripherals - Magic Trackpad 2 ($129), Magic Mouse 2 ($79), and Magic Keyboard ($99) - for its desktops. Magic Trackpad 2 supports Force Touch (pressure-sensitive controls).

In March, Apple launched a 12" retina MacBook with a Force Touch trackpad. In May, it launched a 15" Force Touch-capable MacBook Pro, and cut the price of its cheapest 5K 27" iMac to $1,999.

In a wide-ranging interview with Handelsblatt, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk trash talks Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), among other things.
Asked whether he takes Apple's automotive ambitions seriously: "Did you ever take a look at the Apple Watch? (laughs) No, seriously: It’s good that Apple is moving and investing in this direction. But cars are very complex compared to phones or smartwatches."
On Apple hiring Tesla's "most important engineers": "Important engineers? They have hired people we’ve fired. We always jokingly call Apple the “Tesla Graveyard.” If you don’t make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple. I’m not kidding."
On profitability: "I hope to be profitable next year. I agree, we cannot be making losses forever. This year we’ll be investing a lot into the manufacturing ramp-up of the Model X, and in the long term, the Model 3 as well. So our goal from next year onwards is to be cash-flow positive. But we wouldn’t slow down our growth for the sake of profitability."
On how to grow European sales: "I’ve only been saying it for nine years: step one: expensive car, low volume. Step two: medium price, medium volume. Step three: low price, high volume."
|Oct. 8, 2015, 5:23 PM|PC sales drop sharply again in Q3; Apple, HP, Lenovo gain share


IDC estimates global PC shipments fell 10.8% Y/Y in Q3 to nearly 71M units, a drop nearly as large as Q2's 11.8% and above a 9.2% projection. Gartner estimates shipments fell 7.7% to 73.7M.
IDC: "Across many regions, the channel remained focused on clearing Windows 8 inventory before a more complete portfolio of models incorporating Windows 10 (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Skylake processors comes on the scene ... Though easing a bit, currency devaluation continued to inhibit PC shipments in the third quarter. While Windows 10 has generally received favorable reviews and raised consumer interest in PCs, many users opted to upgrade existing PCs rather than purchase new hardware."
Nonetheless, IDC is "optimistic" about a demand pickup. "While PC shipments will be hampered in the short run by the availability of a free upgrade to Windows 10, the improved PC experience across user segments should drive longer-term demand for new PC hardware..."
Likewise, Gartner expects "more stable market conditions" in 2016. It's also pleased the U.S. notebook and "premium ultramobile" segments saw positive growth. Various analysts have reported seeing signs of stabilizing PC demand.
With tablet sales also under pressure, tablet cannibalization is less of an issue than before. The ability of older PCs to handle mainstream computing tasks without trouble (including on Windows 10) may be a bigger problem. Many in the industry are hoping 4K video and/or virtual reality will fuel upgrades.
The market's four biggest players all grabbed share from smaller firms with less scale. IDC estimates market leader Lenovo's (OTCPK:LNVGY) unit share rose 130 bps Y/Y to 21%, #2 HP's (NYSE:HPQ) 110 bps to 19.6%, and #3 Dell's 120 bps 14.3%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), aided by 1H15 MacBook refreshes, came in at #4 with a 7.5% share, up 60 bps (revenue share is likely closer to 15%). A 4K 21.5" iMac is reportedly launching next week.
Acer (OTC:ASIYF) rounded out the top-5 with a 7% share, down 150 bps. Everyone else collectively fell 270 bps to 30.6%.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has bought VocalIQ, a U.K.-based developer of a "self-learning dialogue platform" that developers and OEMs can use to create personal assistants that understand natural-language questions and commands.
VocalIQ's technology, which could be used to help Siri better decipher conversational language, relies on A.I./machine learning to steadily improve its understanding of human dialogue. Notably, the auto market was a focus area for the company, with GM a partner.
Google (Now) and Microsoft (Cortana) have also been making investments in natural-language processing driven by machine learning. Facebook, meanwhile, recently showed off an assistant (known as M) that relies on both machine learning and actual humans to provide answers.
iOS 9 brought with it Apple's Proactive assistant, which uses both Siri and user data to push relevant content a la Google Now. This year has also seen the launch of the Siri-capable Apple Watch, and is set to see the rollout of an Apple TV set-top supporting Siri. Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN) is believed to help power the platform.

Former Boeing CFO James A. Bell has been named Apple's (AAPL -1.9%) eighth board member. The others are ex-Genentech CEO Art Levinson (chairman), Tim Cook, Al Gore, Disney CEO Bob Iger, ex-Avon CEO Andrea Jung, ex-Northrop Grumman CEO Ronald Sugar, and BlackRock co-founder Susan L. Wagner. J. Crew CEO Mickey Drexler left the board earlier this year.
Separately, Apple has officially rolled out Mac OS X 10.11 (El Capitan), which it first unveiled in June at WWDC. New features include natural language search integration, the auto-arranging of app windows, and major improvements in app launch times and graphics rendering performance (the latter with the help of Apple's new Metal GPU API),
Also: Digitimes (better at reporting supply-chain activity than future product launches) reports  iPhone suppliers are "concerned about the possibility of Apple downward  adjusting" its Q4 chip orders. The site adds a "major analog IC  supplier" has disclosed Apple slightly cut its December orders, but qualifies its remarks by stating suppliers "will have to wait for at least one to two more months before knowing whether there will be significant cuts in their IC orders."
Apple is three days removed from announcing iPhone 6S/6s+ sales topped 13M during their opening weekend, up from 10M+ iPhone 6/6+ sales a year ago. Chinese availability and a longer pre-order period helped.

"We’re considering buying a lot more,” Carl Icahn tells CNBC. He then qualifies his remarks a bit. "I mean, we own 55 million shares or something. We would be buying a lot more if I weren’t as concerned about the market. I think it’s just one of the great situations of many years…"
Icahn, who set a $240 target for Apple (AAPL +0.4%) back in May (partly based on expectations for a TV set that doesn't appear likely to arrive anytime soon), also argues his bearishness on the high-yield bond market doesn't affect his belief Apple (has been raising debt at relatively low rates) should continue buying back stock. The company spent $10B on buybacks in FQ3 (calendar Q2), after having hiked its buyback authorization to $140B in April.
Icahn's remarks come with Apple down 19% from an April high of $134.54, and trading for 11x an FY16 (ends Sep. '16) EPS consensus of $9.77. ~$29/share worth of net cash/investments (much of it offshore) was on the balance sheet at the end of June.
Separately, Tim Cook has disclosed Apple's enterprise-related sales totaled $25B (14% of revenue) for the 12 months ending June. He also reiterated Apple has no plans to merge iOS and Mac OS.
Apple has been more proactive in engaging enterprises during the Cook era, as well as in forming alliances with enterprise IT giants and software firms. The company recently followed up on its 2014 partnership with IBM by partnering with Cisco to create a "fast lane" for iPhones/iPads communicating via Cisco's hardware.

The pressure-sensitive screen looks like a game-changer, says Walt Mossberg, opening up a whole new vista of things Apple (AAPL -2%) and its developers can get you to do. "I can even imagine this working on the screen of a car." His one beef is the 16 gigs of memory on the phone's entry-level model. While Apple says users aren't bumping up against that limit, Mossberg notes the new photos (the "Live Photos" feature) take up twice as much space as the previous pictures.
A fan of Live Photos, the NYT's Brian Chen is less enthusiastic about 3D Touch. He reckons the two new features aren't substantive enough to make it worth it for iPhone 6 users to upgrade.
The Verge's Nilay Patel says by the time developers can really make use of 3D Touch, it'll be time to buy an iPhone 7.
Source: Barron's

Wowed by both Live Photos and 3D Touch, Buzzfeed's John Paczkowski is ready to go out and upgrade his iPhone 6 Plus even though he'll have to buy his way out of his contract. " I think 3D Touch is likely the biggest innovation to the iPhone user-interface since the iPhone user-interface."

The WSJ reports Apple (AAPL +0.9%) has set a 2019 target launch date for its first electric car, and declared it to be a "committed project." Bloomberg previously reported the car could arrive by 2020.
The paper adds Apple, which has already hired a slew of high-profile auto execs and engineers for its Titan car project, has granted Titan's leaders permission to triple the project's 600-person team.
Though Apple has hired self-driving car experts and reportedly wants to produce a driverless vehicle over the long-term, its first car isn't expected to be fully autonomous. Details are scant on whether Apple will rely on manufacturing partners the way it does for the iPhone and various other products. Reuters reported this summer Apple execs toured BMW's German i3 manufacturing plant last year, but left without striking a deal.
Automobiles are arguably one of the few untapped markets big enough to significantly move the needle for Apple, whose FY15 (ends in September) revenue consensus stands at $233.1B.

Re/code reports Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has acquired Mapsense, a startup that provides companies and developers with tools for visualizing and analyzing large volumes of location-tagged data with the help of maps. Sources state the deal cost $25M-$30M.
Apple has made a string of mapping/location services-related acquisitions in recent years, as it works to improve Apple Maps (getting public transit directions via iOS 9). Past purchases include GPS service firm Coherent Navigation, transit app developers HopStop and Embark, and commercial mapping services firm BroadMap.
Separately, S&P CapIQ's Angelo Zino has upgraded Apple to Strong Buy, arguing the launch of annual iPhone upgrade plans directly sold by the company - they were announced at last week's event, and cost $32.41-$44.91/month depending on the model - is "a notable positive."
Zino: "While AAPL’s leasing program is unlikely to drive much additional demand, we believe it is having a direct effect on carriers as the likes of T-Mobile have already begun to offer new more attractive programs than AAPL’s iPhone 6S/Plus program." He also thinks upgrade program adoption will serve to boost iPhone ASPs.
SA author Anthony Ruben argued yesterday Apple's upgrade plans could lower the iPhone's average upgrade cycle time from an estimated 26 months. "From AAPL's perspective, the emphasis has changed from keeping carrier partners happy to more tightly locking customers into the AAPL ecosystem. While there is much controversy surrounding the success of the Apple Watch, it's clear that one of the primary goals of the product is tightening the grip the company has on its customers."

 With market eyes on a Fed rate-hike decision considered to be a bit of a toss-up amid differing opinions, Goldman Sachs is banking on the (slightly) more dovish position that the agency will wait until December. The bank is still laying out how to play the hike when it invariably comes. 
Strength in balance sheets is what you need, it says, noting that those companies outperform (by an average 5%) in the three months after a rate-boosting cycle begins. In Goldman's "High Quality Stock" basket: CMG, DLTR, PEP, KMI, BLK, GOOG, AAPL, PCLN, ORCL, WFC. Meanwhile, it suggests avoiding companies with high floating-rate debt as they bear the brunt of a move away from near-zero interest rate policy. "When the tightening cycle finally starts, the immediate impact will be felt by firms with high proportions of variable rate borrowing." Included in that "avoid" list: CL, COL, JNJ, AAPL, EBAY, MET, KO, GIS, F, MCD, GM, TWX, CVX, AGN, MON.
(Yes, cash-rich Apple made both lists, having a strong balance sheet along with floating debt.) |Sep. 14, 2015, 9:18 AM|Apple states initial iPhone sales on pace to top year-ago levels; shares +2.6% (updated)


Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) "Customer response to iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus has been extremely positive and preorders this weekend were very strong around the world. We are on pace to beat last year's 10 million unit first-weekend record when the new iPhones go on sale September 25."

Reuters states 4.5M pre-orders are expected by analysts this year, up from 4M last year. The pre-order period lasts longer this year (Sep. 12-24) than last year (Sep. 12-18).
iPhone sales growth rates have been expected to slow considerably following the 6S/6S+ launch, given the iPhone 6/6+ benefited from a strong upgrade cycle fueled by pent-up demand for larger iPhones. Apple's iPhone revenue was up 59% Y/Y in calendar Q2 to $31.4B, and made up 63% of total revenue.
The iPhone Inventory Tracker blog shows 3-4 week lead times for iPhone 6S+ models worldwide. Most iPhone 6S models are still set to ship on Sep. 25 in the U.S, but have 2-3 week lead times in China.
Shares have risen to $117.14 premarket. Nasdaq futures are nearly flat.

Last week: Apple unveils iPhone 6S/6S+ with 3D Touch sensors, A9 CPU, improved cameras

Update (12:32PM ET): Bernstein's Toni Sacconaghi offers a mixed reaction to Apple's remarks. "On one hand, first weekend sales that will be higher than last year’s is clearly a positive, given how strong the iPhone 6 cycle was ... However, Apple did not provide this figure today, raising the question of whether it *might* be lower than last year’s total of 4M. Additionally, the iPhone this year is available for pre-order and for delivery on day 1 in China, and based on lead times, demand for the 6S appears very strong in China."  Apple is now up 0.8%.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is aiming to raise between €1.5B-€2B split equally across two different bond issues, reports the WSJ. Pricing guidance for the paper maturing in 2024 is 1.4-1.45%, and 2.05-2.1% for the debt coming due in 2027.
The bonds are expected to price later today, and there have been orders for €4.5B so far. Among the uses for the proceeds will be the funding of buybacks and dividends - the company has promised to return $200B to shareholders by the end of March 2017.
U.S. firms have accounted for more than 22% of all euro-denominated corporate bond issuance in 2015 (up from 12% in 2014), more than French and Italian companies combined. Apple last tapped the eurozone in November, raising nearly €3B in two separate issues.

Not surprisingly, the 4.7" iPhone 6S and 5.5" 6S+ (AAPL -0.6%) look similar to their predecessors on the outside, save for the addition of a rose gold color. On the inside, haptic 3D Touch sensors have been added (in-line with rumors). They enable tactile feedback for actions, as well as pressure-sensitive controls (i.e. pressing hard on a screen brings up content/menu options that don't appear if one presses lightly).
The Mail, Music, Camera, Maps, and Messages apps support 3D Touch, as does the Home screen. Facebook/Instagram, Dropbox, and Tencent are among the developers initially supporting it.

iPhone 6S/6S+ specs: As expected, the 6S/6S+ run on an A9 CPU: Apple promises up to 70% higher CPU performance, and up to 90% higher GPU performance, than the A8. An M9 motion co-processor is now built into the CPU, and always on - NXP (NXPI -1.1%) has been manufacturing standalone motion co-processors for Apple. The cover glass - possibly Corning's (GLW -0.7%) Gorilla Glass 4 - is declared to be the industry's strongest.
The rear camera's pixel count has been upped to 12MP, and the front camera's to 5MP; Apple promises no related dropoff in pixel quality. 4K video support has been added for the rear camera (also as rumored), and autofocus performance and color accuracy improved. A feature called Live Photos (leverages 3D Touch) plays a short video clip when a user hard-presses a picture.

Pricing/availability: Subsidized pricing matches that for the iPhone 6/6+ at launch time, as do the 16/64/128GB storage tiers; 6/6+ models have received $100 price cuts . An upgrade program (a new iPhone per year, starts at $32/month) will be sold at Apple Stores. 6S/6S+ pre-orders start on Sep. 12; the phones officially go on sale on Sep. 25. iOS 9 launches on Sep. 16.

More Apple TV details: The set-top runs on an A8 CPU (found in the iPhone 6/6+), and supports 802.11ac Wi-Fi. Its remote communicates via Bluetooth, and has built-in motion sensors (enables Nintendo Wii-like gaming). Apps from Zillow, Gilt, the MLB, and indie game developers have been demoed. 3rd-party Bluetooth gaming controllers are supported.
A 32GB version of the new Apple TV set-top will sell for $149, and a  64GB model for $199; the devices launch in late October. The current  Apple TV will continue to be sold for $69.

"We believe the future of television is apps," says Tim Cook (AAPL +0.1%) just before he unveils a next-gen Apple TV set-top. "The television experience has been virtually standing still while innovation in the mobile space has been racing ahead. Today, we are going to do something about that."
In-line with rumors, the new Apple TV features an App Store, a new OS (called tvOS), Siri and gaming support, universal content search, and a revamped remote with a Siri button and glass touchpad. Siri is emphasized - among other things, it can be used to control content, navigate the UI, and pull up info related (and unrelated) to a show.
The set-top directly squares off against Roku's hardware, Amazon's Fire TV, and devices running Google's Android TV, and indirectly against gaming consoles. Pricing (not yet announced) has been rumored to start at $149.
The iPad Mini 4 has also been (briefly) announced: It's said to feature the iPad Air 2's internals in a smaller form factor, and starts at $399. The iPad Mini 2's price has been cut by $30 to $269; the Air and Air 2 still respectively start at $399 and $499.
Microsoft exec Kirk Konigsbauer (NASDAQ:MSFT) appeared on stage at Apple's event, demoing the use of Office iOS apps on an iPad Pro for corporate viewers. The use of the Pro's multitasking features and Pencil stylus have been shown off.
Continuing a theme of making nice with rivals, Adobe (ADBE -0.2%) exec Eric Snowden has also appeared, pitching creative pros on the ability to do advanced photo/document-editing on the Pro via Adobe apps.
As expected, the 32GB Wi-Fi-only iPad Pro will sell for $799. 64GB  (Wi-Fi) and 128GB (Wi-Fi/4G) models respectively go for $949 and $1,079.  The Smart Keyboard and Pencil accessories will respectively go for $169  and $99. The Pro becomes available in November.

|Sep. 9, 2015, 1:32 PM|Apple unveils 12.9" iPad Pro, new Watch finishes/accessories (updated)


The much-rumored 12.9" iPad Pro has been unveiled at Apple's (AAPL +0.1%) San Francisco event. Why 12.9"? The width of the Pro is equal to the height of the 9.7" iPad Air, aiding split-screen multitasking.
The Pro runs on an A9X CPU said to have twice the memory bandwidth, GPU performance, and storage performance of the A8X used in the Air 2, and 80% greater CPU performance (declared to be "desktop-class").
The display sports 5.6M pixels, and thickness is at 6.9mm. 10-hour battery life is promised. A Smart Keyboard accessory (echoes of Microsoft's Surface Touch/Type Covers) will be offered, as will a pressure-sensitive stylus called Pencil (echoes of the Surface Pen and Samsung's S-Pen). An 8MP camera sits on the back.
No word on the Pro's pricing yet. 9to5 Mac has reported the Pro will start at $799 (32GB, Wi-Fi-only).
The Apple Watch was the first product line to get airtime at the event. Gold and rose gold models (in anodized aluminum) have been announced, along with a partnership with luxury accessory maker Hermes for Watch bands.
Tim Cook, perhaps hoping to counter reports of subdued demand, claims the Watch has a 97% customer satisfaction rate. WatchOS 2, first unveiled at WWDC, officially launches on Sep. 16 - it supports 3rd-party apps and "Complications" that mash up content from different sources.

|Sep. 9, 2015, 3:26 AM|Apple set to introduce new iPhones, iPad and Apps for Apple TV

 Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is today due to unveil the latest versions of the iPhone, the 6S and 6S+, at an event in San Francisco, where it is also expected to introduce a bigger iPad and the opening of Apple TV to third party app developers. Upgrades to the iPhone are likely to include much-improved cameras, as well as Force Touch, which allows users to open features by pressing down harder on the screen. |Sep. 4, 2015, 3:01 PM|Sony promises big image sensor investments ahead of iPhone 6S launch


With demand from Apple and Chinese mobile OEMs remaining strong, CEO Kaz Hirai Sony (SNE -3.1%) plans to invest €1.5B ($1.7B) in its image sensor ops in FY16 (ends March '16)  - 5x what it invested in FY15.
The remarks come as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) gets set to launch the iPhone 6S/6S+, which are expected to feature much-improved cameras. The rear camera is rumored to support 12MP still photos, 4K video recording, and a faster burst mode; the front camera is reportedly being upgraded to 5MP.
Image sensors have been a strong point for Sony as it deals with weak smartphone and (PS4 excluded) home electronics sales. The company is believed to be taking share from OmniVision (OVTI +0.7%), which is expected by the Street to see its FY16 (ends April '16) sales drop 8.8% Y/Y.
|Sep. 2, 2015, 2:21 PM|Report: Apple plans to unveil iPad Pro, iPad Mini 4 at iPhone event


In addition to the iPhone 6S/6S+ and a new Apple TV set-top, Apple's (AAPL +3.4%) Sep. 9 event will also feature the unveiling of the oft-rumored iPad Pro and a 4th-gen iPad Mini, "trusted sources" tell 9to5 Mac. A 3rd-gen iPad Air is also reportedly being prepped, but won't launch until 2016.
The Pro, previously rumored to have a 12.9" display, will reportedly see pre-orders start in late October and fully launch in November. 9to5 states the device will support a Force Touch-based stylus and come with stereo speakers. The 4th-gen Mini is said to be thinner than its predecessor and run on an A8 CPU, and to "likely" feature upgraded cameras.
In June, Apple showed off iPad multitasking features (part of iOS 9) that would work well with a larger, business-focused, tablet. The Pro could provide a lift to broader iPad sales, which were down 23% Y/Y in calendar Q2 to $4.5B.

Also reported by 9to5: The iPhone 6S and 6S+ will retain the 6/6+'s 16/64/128GB storage tiers, as well as their subsidized launch prices. One hardware change: Apple is reportedly using the stronger 7000 series aluminum it first debuted with the Apple Watch.
Meanwhile, more details have been shared about the next-gen Apple TV (prior coverage). Sources tell BuzzFeed the device will start at $149 and contain a universal search feature that can query multiple video services. 9to5 Mac states the new Apple TV will have an A8 CPU, the same ports as the prior-gen model, and no 4K video support.
Apple is up strongly a day after dropping 4.5%. The Nasdaq is up 1.6%.
|Sep. 1, 2015, 12:28 PM|Apple reportedly talks with Hollywood about financing original content



Variety reports Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) "has held preliminary conversations in recent weeks with executives in Hollywood to suss out their interest in spearheading efforts to produce entertainment content." Internet software/services chief Eddy Cue's team is said to be responsible for the efforts.
Sources provide varying takes on the scope of Apple's ambitions: One "high-level executive" says Apple wants to "create development and production divisions that would churn out long-form content to stream in a bid to compete with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)," while others suggest "the company’s exploration as more of a flirtation." Apple reportedly tried to hire the stars of BBC's Top Gear; they wound up signing with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in a deal reportedly worth ~$7M/episode.
The report follows several stating Apple plans to launch a Web TV service. Most recently, Bloomberg reported Apple is hoping to launch the service in 2016, and charge around $40/month.
|Aug. 31, 2015, 2:37 PM|Apple forms alliance with Cisco; new Apple TV reportedly emphasizes Siri/gaming


Apple (AAPL -0.3%) is partnering with Cisco (CSCO -0.3%) to improve the performance of iOS devices - in Apple/Cisco's words, create a "fast lane" for iPhones/iPads - communicating via Cisco's networking hardware, which is ubiquitous at many enterprises and institutions.
The companies are also working on creating "a seamless experience" between iPhones and desk phones in environments featuring Cisco voice/video hardware. Cisco's WebEx Web conferencing platform, Telepresence videoconferencing hardware, and Spark Web collaboration platform will be covered by the tie-up.
The deal comes 13 months after Apple announced a partnership with IBM, which has since led to Big Blue releasing a number of iOS apps meant for business verticals. Apple has also partnered with various indie developers to bring enterprise-focused iOS apps to market.
Separately, 9to5 Mac reports the next Apple TV set-top (expected to be shown off at Apple's Sep. 9 event) will sell for $149-$199, support 3rd-party Bluetooth gaming controllers to go with downloadable App Store games, and come with a remote featuring motion sensors and a button that activates Siri.
The site previously reported Apple plans to continue selling the current $69 Apple TV, and that both the new and old models will support Apple's Web TV service when it launches. BuzzFeed has also shared details about the next-gen model.
Also: Piper's Gene Munster speculates Apple is exploring its options in the augmented reality market. He highlights Apple's purchases of motion sensor maker PrimeSense and AR software firm/patent owner Metaio, as well as the hiring of the lead audio engineer for Microsoft's HoloLens AR headset.

 Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is adding to what looks to be a growing automated-car expert team, hiring away a senior engineer from Tesla, Reuters notes in combing through LinkedIn profiles. Jamie Carlson's profile shows he's left Tesla for an unnamed position in a special projects group at Apple, Reuters says, noting six others with a background in self-driving technology have recently joined Apple. Carlson is one of a number of Tesla hires (described earlier this year as a "poaching war"). This year, Apple has hired former Volkswagen engineer Megan McClain as well as Vinay Palakkode, graduate researcher at Carnegie Mellon, a hub for automated driving research. Last week, The Guardian wrote that Apple has "hundreds of engineers" quietly working on autonomous technologies in California. Other reports have Apple hiring people with related experience from several automakers, including BMW, Volkswagen, Ford, Fiat Chrysler and Mercedes-Benz, as well as from suppliers such as Robert Bosch, TRW and Delphi Automotive.
After today's 6.1% decline, shares in Apple are up 0.5%  in active after-hours trading.

The Guardian reports Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Project Titan car initiative has advanced to the point where the company has inquired about using a secure California facility (known as GoMentum Station) that's used by automakers to test self-driving/autonomous vehicles.
An official for the government agency overseeing the facility: “We had to sign a non-disclosure agreement with Apple. We can’t tell you anything other than they’ve come in and they’re interested.”

The Guardian adds Apple now has "hundreds of engineers quietly working on autonomous technologies" at a building in Sunnyvale, CA, not far from its Cupertino HQ. Past reports have indicated Apple has hired senior auto execs and engineers from the likes of Tesla, Fiat Chrysler, and Mercedes-Benz, and has tapped ex-Ford VP Steve Zadesky to head its car project.

Bloomberg has reported Apple wants to bring an electric car to market by 2020. More recently, Reuters reported Tim Cook and other execs toured BMW's Leipzig, Germany manufacturing plant last year to learn more about the production of the i3 electric car, and that BMW "signaled readiness to license parts."

|Aug. 13, 2015, 6:09 PM|Bloomberg: Apple now aiming for 2016 Web TV service launch


After previously aiming for a fall launch, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is now looking to bring its Web TV service to market in 2016, Bloomberg reports. The delay is blamed on slow-moving licensing talks with TV networks such as CBS, NBC, and Fox, and the need for network capacity upgrades.
Re/code previously reported Apple's service might not launch until 2016 or late 2015. More recently, BuzzFeed reported the service wouldn't be announced at Apple's September iPhone event; a new Apple TV set-top is expected.
Bloomberg's sources suggest Apple wants to charge ~$40/month for its service. Dish's Sling TV service provides a limited number of channels for $20/month, while Sony's more expansive PlayStation Vue service goes for $50-$70/month.
Regarding network capacity, Apple (unsurprisingly) wants to improve quality and keep bandwidth costs down by using CDNs to stream content from data centers that are close to users. The company has been building out its own CDN, and also continues to heavily use market leader Akamai's (NASDAQ:AKAM) services.
In other news, a federal appeals court has turned down Samsung's request to review the 2012 infringement verdict won by Apple in a California court.

After rallying strongly yesterday, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has more than given back its gains today amid a 1.7% drop for the Nasdaq. 70.7M shares have been traded, well above a 3-month daily average of 46.9M.
Jefferies' Sundeep Bajikar has cut his target by $5 to $130 (still over $16 above current levels), while reiterating a Hold. "Our checks on the ground in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Seoul and Tokyo suggest iPhone is enjoying robust consumer demand. However, given stock market worries (since late-June) in China, we would not be surprised if Apple was taking a more cautious view of end demand, and cutting iPhone-related orders in the supply chain. Our checks also continue to suggest that iPhone is facing strong competition in China, primarily from Huawei, Xiaomi, and Samsung." Apple's Greater China revenue was up 112% Y/Y in FQ3 (calendar Q2), and made up 27% of total revenue.
The note comes shortly after the PBOC devalued the yuan, leading it to drop 2% against the dollar. Beijing's move could spell both slightly higher local prices (on a yuan basis) for Apple products, and slightly lower manufacturing costs (on a dollar basis).
Separately, Bluefin Research reports checks point to an approximate 10-day delay for the start of iPhone 6S production. "While we cannot decipher the exact reason for the delay, this has resulted in a reduction of projected iPhone builds for 2H:15. Previous build plans were centered around 130M total iPhone builds (not shipments) and these have recently been reduced by just over 6% to approximately 122M." KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo has also reported seeing a brief delay.
|Aug. 10, 2015, 3:01 PM|Apple up 3.7% as markets rally, analysts defend


The Nasdaq is up 1.2%, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is doing more than its fair share. 44.5M shares have been traded thus far vs. a 3-month daily average of 46.9M.
Bernstein, Oppenheimer, and Nomura have issued bullish notes today. Berntein's Toni Sacconaghi argues iPhone sales can still rise in 2016 in spite of the tough comps produced by a strong iPhone 6/6+ upgrade cycle: He argues further high-end smartphone share gains are possible, notes first-time iPhone buyers still account for ~35% of sales, and observes many U.S. buyers are no longer beholden to 2-year contracts. Chinese income growth and an iPhone 6/6+ price cut (following the 6S launch) are also seen as catalysts.
Oppenheimer's Andrew Uerkwitz also cites Chinese growth and high-end share gains as potential catalysts - he thinks the Chinese iPhone base will surpass the U.S. base in 2015 - and argues Apple's service revenue growth is underappreciated. He adds chip suppliers with strong Apple exposure are outperforming peers amid an industry downturn.
Nomura's Jeffrey Kvaal: "Fears of broad order cancellations in Apple’s supply chain driven by soft China demand appear exaggerated to us. Our Taiwan Technology team, led by Anne Lee, notes that some suppliers, such as Catcher, have not seen cancellations over the past month. Bottlenecks may defer demand slightly for some vendors, but stable orders and an on-track 6S launch suggest fears will be short lived ... We believe the 6S will enter a subscriber base no more penetrated with the 6 than a typical launch – likely the low end of our 35-40% range."
Apple is now up 7% from a Wednesday low of $112.10, but still down 8% from where it traded going into its July 21 FQ3 report. Cirrus Logic (CRUS +4%), which received 62% of its calendar Q2 revenue from Apple, is also outperforming.
|Aug. 7, 2015, 4:23 PM|Report: Apple's next iPhone event set for week of September 7


BuzzFeed's John Paczkowski (has a good track record with Apple scoops) reports Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) plans to unveil its next-gen iPhones (expected to be called the 6S and 6S+) on the week of Sep. 7, and that Sep. 9 (Wednesday) is "the most likely date."
He reiterates Apple also plans to show off a next-gen Apple TV set-top. New iPads are also expected, but the much-rumored 12.9" model is said to be "a wildcard."
The report meshes with Apple's historical timetable for announcing new iPhones. Traditionally, the devices officially go on sale the Friday of the following week - in this case, that would be Sep. 18.
Past reports have indicated the 6S/6S+ will sport haptic Force Touch sensors - Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) is believed to be supplying needed parts - to go with a new CPU (the A9), 2GB of RAM (improved from the iPhone 6/6+'s 1GB), and a Qualcomm 4G modem with a 300Mbps peak download speed (up from a current 150Mbps).
The WSJ has reported Apple wants manufacturers to produce 85M-90M 6S/6S+ units by year's end, and is thinking of selling a pink model.

Arguing the iPhone 6S/6S+ will be an "incremental upgrade" that won't be enough to drive "a significant change in the pace of share gains," BofA/Merrill's Wamsi Mohan has downgraded Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Neutral, and cut his target by $12 to $130.

Mohan: "Given Apple's expertise from supply chain all the way to software, Apple can become a significant player overnight across many markets. Although we recognize this potential and continue to expect Apple to deliver phenomenal products, we believe the financials will take a pause from the significant growth witnessed over the past year and we would become more constructive at a lower stock price, when risk reward becomes a better tradeoff."
He also thinks Chinese growth will slow, that new products such as the Apple Watch won't drive significant growth for the time being, and that new capital return announcements are unlikely in the near-term.

AAPL -1.3% premarket to $113.20. Some growth concerns have already been priced in over the last two weeks: Apple is down 13% since offering light FQ4 guidance to go with an FQ3 beat on July 21. The 42-analyst FY16 (ends Sep. '16) revenue growth consensus is at just 4.9%, compared with an FY15 consensus of 27.5%.

Shares go for 11.8x an FY16 (ends Sep. '16) EPS consensus of $9.77.|Aug. 3, 2015, 1:26 PM|Report: Apple in talks to offer mobile phone services on MVNO basis (updated)


Citing "sources close to Apple," Business Insider reports Apple (AAPL -2.5%) is "privately trialing" a U.S. mobile phone service, and is also in talks with European carriers to offer something similar. The services would be provided on an MVNO basis - Apple wouldn't build/own the underlying infrastructure, but obtain wholesale access from existing carriers.
BI cautions there's no guarantee the services will go beyond the test phase, and that Apple "could take at least five years" to do a full launch. The company has reportedly talked with carriers for years about the idea, so much so that sources call Apple's interest in launching an MVNO an "open secret" within the industry.
Launching MVNOs would extend Apple's control over the iPhone user experience to voice/data services, and allow it to experiment with new service plans/pricing. It could also trigger a backlash among carriers that find themselves competing with an Apple MVNO, and aren't getting wholesale revenue. However, the fact carriers would still have no other company to buy iPhones from could limit the fallout.
In April, Google launched a beta for its aggressively-priced Project Fi MVNO service, in partnership with Sprint and T-Mobile. However, for now, the service is only available via Google/Motorola Mobility's Nexus 6 phablet.
Shares have sold off amid a 0.8% decline for the Nasdaq. They're at their lowest levels since February.

Update: Also reported by BI: Apple is prepping a voicemail service that will use Siri to answer calls and transcribe messages. It's expected to launch in 2016.

Update 2 (8/4): Apple says it hasn't discussed launching an MVNO service, and has no plans to do so.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) plans to unveil a next-gen Apple TV set-top in September "at the same event at which it typically unveils its new iPhones," reports BuzzFeed's John Paczkowski. He previously reported Apple planned to show off the device in June at WWDC, but (along with others) later stated the launch had been postponed to fix lingering issues.
Apple's much-rumored Web TV service reportedly isn't expected to be announced at the same time. Re/code's Peter Kafka reported in June the service might launch in late 2015, or in 2016, as negotiations with TV channel owners continue.
As previously indicated, the next Apple TV is said to run on an A8 CPU, provide a storage upgrade, support the App Store and Siri, and come with a developer SDK. Paczkowski also states it will have a "refreshed and slimmer chassis," and a remote with touchpad input.
The current-gen Apple TV (launched in 2012) saw its price cut by $30 earlier this year to $69. 25M+ Apple TV units have been sold over the product's lifetime.

 Some of the biggest and best known U.S. businesses join the Obama administration in trying to build momentum for a deal at the climate change summit in Paris later this year. A dozen publicly traded companies - AA, AAPL, MSFT, BAC, BRK.B, KO, GM, GS, GOOG, PEP, UPS and WMT - committed to support a “strong" outcome in  Paris, and made new pledges to take a variety of steps to tackle climate  change. For example, Alcoa says it will reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. by 50% by 2025, and BRK plans to retire 75% of its coal-fueled generating capacity in Nevada by 2019. In addition to company-specific goals, the White House says today's announcements total at least $140B in new low-carbon investment and more than 1,600 MW of new renewable energy. |Jul. 27, 2015, 1:55 AM|Apple Watch hits Best Buy stores

Cowen has downgraded Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Market Perform after the company beat FQ3 estimates, offered light FQ4 guidance, and reported slightly below-consensus iPhone sales. Others on the Street are reiterating their existing ratings (largely bullish).

Upbeat on Monday, Cowen's Tim Arcuri now thinks "evidence of a widespread demand reset from China is mounting." He cites not only FQ3 iPhone sales, but also Chinese auto sales figures and results from multiple chipmakers. In addition, Arcuri states field work suggests new iPhone builds are down relative to the past cycle for the first time. "[W]hile we are very bullish about AAPL’s ability to tap into a much broader and deeper demand opportunity for a price-reduced 6/6+ than prior 'old' models, this is a different narrative."
UBS' Steve Milunovich (Buy): "Our call that the phone ASP would be $660 was correct but we overestimated units, especially with channel inventory declining ... Despite seasonally low iPhone units, we believe Apple is building long-term value and maintain our $150 price target. Also, it is unclear if Sep guidance includes 6s sales to China, which were delayed into October last year.”
Canaccord's Mike Walkley (Buy): "[W]e believe the current iPhone 6 and upcoming iPhone 6s should continue to post strong sales and high-end smartphone market share gains ... with only 27% of the iPhone installed base having upgraded to the iPhone 6/6 Plus devices by [FQ3], we anticipate continued strong replacement sales through 2015."
"As Apple has become the 'gold standard' of technology, it is held to a higher standard," argues FBR's Daniel Ives (Outperform). With Greater China revenue up 112% Y/Y in FQ3, he considers China concerns overblown, but wants to see more transparency regarding Watch sales.

Apple Watch (NASDAQ:AAPL) accounted for well over 100% of the $952M in annual revenue growth seen by Apple's Other Products segment in FQ3, CFO Luca Maestri mentioned on the earnings call. Bloomberg observes Maestri's remarks point to 1.9M+ Watch sales, if one assumes a $499 ASP. (live blogs: WSJ, BI)
Tim Cook stated Watch sales were higher in June than in April or May. He once more declined to provide specific Watch revenue/unit figures, while asserting Apple has chosen not to do so to keep info out of competitors' hands.
He also once more defends the iPad (units -18% Y/Y to 10.9M), estimating Apple has 76% of the market for $200+ tablets and stating customer sell-through (11.2M) was better than sell-in thanks to a 300K-unit drop in channel inventories.
The iPhone (units +35% to 47.5M, but below a ~49M consensus) saw channel inventories fall by 600K Q/Q, bringing them to the low end of Apple's 5-7 week target range. Greater China iPhone sales were up 87% Y/Y and Mac sales 33%. 27% of iPhone users are said to have upgraded to a 6/6+.
Also: 1) A strong dollar had an 8% impact on revenue growth, and a $24 impact on iPhone ASP; the latter was still up $99 Y/Y, thanks in part to the 6+. 2) 89% of Apple's cash balance is offshore. 3) The retail store count is up to 456 (190 outside the U.S.). 4) 8,500 third-party Watch apps are now available.

Piper, Cantor, and Cowen have each released upbeat notes ahead of Tuesday afternoon's FQ3 report. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has risen to its highest levels since May 26, and is less than $2.50 away from an April 28 high of $134.54. The Nasdaq is up 0.3%.
Piper's Gene Munster, bullish as ever, forecasts FQ3 EPS of $1.82, revenue of $50B, and iPhone sales of 49M-50M (moderately above consensus). "To put 49 million in perspective, it would imply 39% y/y unit growth vs the Mar-15 quarter of 38% excluding 1 million in channel fill ... This acceleration reflects iPhone gaining share at the high-end of the market, a trend that we expect to continue throughout 2015." He expects 17% iPhone unit growth for the whole of 2015, and flat growth in 2016.
Cantor's Brian White: "During our Taiwan trip in early June, many of our contacts highlighted weak trend across the smartphone and notebook markets; however, we walked away pleased the tone for iPhones and Macs relative to our expectations ... we are raising our iPhone unit estimate to 48.5 million from 46.25 million ... but lowering our iPad projection to 9.5 million from 10.9 million units ... We are maintaining our Mac shipment forecast at 4.93 million units but increasing our Mac forecast for the September quarter."
Cowen's Tim Arcuri: "We model iPhone units 50MM (incl. 28MM 6 and 13MM 6+), above Street which seems 48-49MM. We raised ests in June ... but still see upward bias given 1) our latest field work suggesting ongoing cuts to supply chain for iPhone’s high-end competition (e.g. Samsung Galaxy S6); 2) recent Cowen survey data showing increased iPhone penetration growth and meaningful future loyalty at key U.S. operators ... and 3) China sales which remain strong despite demand and stock market uncertainties."
Wells Fargo's Maynard Um has also hiked his estimates, albeit while maintaining a Market Perform rating. "We think [iPhone] unit upside could be driven by the 25 carriers added in the quarter ... as well as purposely building indirect channel inventory (ended last quarter at the low end of its 5-7 week target) ... We believe gross margin upside in this S-cycle may be offset by increased bill of materials and potential pricing actions at the lower end."
Separately, research firm Wristly states a survey of Apple Watch owners found 66% were "very satisfied/delighted" with the device, and that 31% were "somewhat satisfied" with it.

A little over three months after downgrading to Hold - shares were at $125.49 at the time - SocGen's Andy Perkins has upgraded Apple (AAPL +1.1%) back to Buy, while keeping his target at $140. Shares are following markets higher.
Ahead of Apple's July 21 FQ3 report, Perkins has hiked his FQ3 iPhone sales estimate by 5M units to 48M. His revenue and EPS estimates for the quarter are respectively at $50.2B and $1.84, above a consensus of $49B and $1.78.
Discussing recent Chinese concerns, Perkins admits "any slowdown in the Chinese economy, whether or not stemming from the recent stock market turmoil, could have an adverse impact." He adds SocGen hasn't "factored in any slowdown in [Chinese] iPhone sales," and thinks nearly a third of FQ3 iPhone sales came from China.
Regarding Apple Watch, Perkins states SocGen's data "suggests an encouraging start for the new product," while cautioning the firm is "finding it difficult to find corroborating evidence to support our figures." The data points to 5M FQ3 Watch sales, 8M FY15 sales, and 19M FY16 sales. With FQ3 ASP estimated to be near $500, Perkins forecasts quarterly Watch revenue of ~$2.5B.
Separately, Digitimes - historically better at providing supply chain data than launch dates - reports suppliers are expected to begin shipping components for the rumored 12.9" iPad in late September, and that the tablet is expected to become available after mid-November.
Apple is said to be "rather cautious about placing related orders." In June, the company unveiled iPad multitasking features (will arrive via iOS 9) that would work well with a 12.9" iPad.
|Jul. 13, 2015, 2:58 AM|Apple's dominance of profit almost complete

 Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) grabbed 92% of the operating profit of the world's top eight smartphone companies in Q1, financial firm Canaccord Genuity calculates, up from 65% a year earlier. Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) took 15% in this year's period. The reason why Apple and Samsung earned over 100% combined is because some rivals only broke even or lost money. Apple's dominance of profit share comes despite the company selling under 20% of smartphones and because its devices are much more expensive than those of its competitors. The story is similar in the PC industry, although not as extreme. Apple enjoyed over half of industry profits last year despite its Mac line taking a market share of just 6%, Bernstein Research estimates. |Jul. 9, 2015, 10:02 PM|IDC: PC sales fell 11.8% Y/Y in Q2



IDC estimates global PC shipments tumbled to 66.1M in Q2, falling at a sharper Y/Y clip than Q1's 6.7% and about 1% faster than expected. Gartner is slightly less harsh, estimating shipments fell 9.5% to 68.4M.
Factors blamed for the decline: Inventory reductions ahead of the Windows 10 launch (set for July 29), a strong dollar (has led to higher overseas prices), and tough Y/Y comps caused by the 2014 boost in business PC sales caused by the end of Windows XP support. With tablet sales under pressure as well, tablet cannibalization is less of a factor than before ... but rising smartphone/tablet usage still appears to be taking a toll on PC upgrade rates.
Gartner sees full-year shipments falling 4.4%. IDC still expects low-to-mid single-digit declines in 2H15, before volumes stabilize in future years. It sees the Windows 10 launch going "relatively well," but cautions Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) decision to provide free upgrades to Windows 7/8 users will limit its impact on PC sales.
Continuing a recent trend, market leaders grabbed share from smaller rivals. IDC estimates #1 Lenovo's (OTCPK:LNVGY) share rose to 20.3% from 19.4% a year ago, #2 HP's (NYSE:HPQ) to 18.5% from 18.2%, and #3 Dell's to 14.5% from 14%. Acer (OTC:ASIYF) and Asus (OTC:AKCPF) are respectively given 6.6% and 6.5% shares
Curiously, IDC has Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranked #4 globally, with its share rising to 7.8% from 5.9% via 5.1M Mac shipments (could imply a 15%+ revenue share), but Gartner doesn't have the company in its top-5. IDC and Gartner respectively assign Apple 13.5% and 12.7% U.S. shares. In the past, IDC's Mac shipment estimates have been notably different from the quarterly figures Apple would later report.
Near-term expectations for PC sales are already quite low, following Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Q1 warning, AMD's Q2 warning, Micron's (NASDAQ:MU) June 25 results/guidance, and plenty of other negative news. Intel's Q2 report arrives on July 15.

After trading higher this morning, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) sold off on strong volume in afternoon trading. 77.7M shares changed hands today, topping a 3-month daily average of 45.1M. The Nasdaq rose 0.3%.

Chinese macro fears fueled by the country's stock market crash are receiving plenty of ink. FBR's Daniel Ives: “China is poised to be Apple's high-octane fuel for the next few years, especially for iPhones ... Given a lot of the dark clouds we are seeing in China, that has spooked investors.” Chinese stocks rose overnight after fresh attempts by regulators to halt the plunge
In an intraday note, Goldman cited Chinese worries as one of four potential factors weighing on shares, along with reports of soft Watch demand, a buyback blackout period, and sales by hedge funds and mutual funds.
UBS, meanwhile, issued a note (.pdf) stating checks point to strong FQ3 (calendar Q2) Chinese iPhone sales. The firm admitted "a slowing Chinese economy is a risk," but downplayed fears a market crash will have a big macro impact, given equities account for only 20% of household wealth (12%-13% if one counts property). Thanks partly to pent-up demand for larger iPhones, Apple's Greater China revenue rose 71% Y/Y in FQ2 to $16.8B (29% of total revenue).
FQ3 results arrive on July 21. Shares currently go for 12.3x an FY16 (ends Sep. '16) EPS consensus of $9.73.

|Jul. 8, 2015, 12:13 PM|WSJ: Apple wants suppliers to produce 85M-90M iPhone 6S units


Apple (AAPL -1.8%) wants contract manufacturers to produce 85M-90M 4.7" and 5.5" iPhone 6S units by year's end, the WSJ reports. A year ago, the company initially asked for 70M-80M iPhone 6 units.
The WSJ reiterates the next-gen iPhones are expected to feature Force Touch haptic sensors, and that Apple might provide a fourth color option - the paper previously reported the color to be pink.
A third contract manufacturer - Wistron - might join Foxconn and Pegatron in producing 6S units. Assuming demand matches, strong iPhone builds would be a positive for audio codec supplier Cirrus Logic (CRUS -3.9%), which continues to get well over half its revenue from Apple.
Other Apple news: 1) A federal judge has thrown out a $533M damages award against Apple levied by a jury that ruled iTunes infringed 3 patents owned by private SmartFlash LLC. A new damages trial will start on Sep. 14. 2) Ahead of Apple's July 21 FQ3 report, Credit Suisse ($145 target) has hiked its iPhone estimates, and cut its iPad estimates. The firm now expects 250M calendar 2015 iPhone sales , with the 6+ accounting for 27% of all units.
Apple is selling off amid a 1.4% drop for the Nasdaq. Many tech names with strong Chinese exposure are underperforming; concerns have been aired about the impact of a Chinese stock market crash on consumer demand.

Pac Crest's Andy Hargreaves: "Although we continue to expect iPhone (AAPL +0.6%) sales to decline in the coming refresh cycle, ongoing share gains should prevent the decline from being as severe as we previously expected ... We believe the majority of people earning $15,000 a year or more in the world will own an iPhone exiting F2015." His FY15 (ends Sep. '15) and FY16 iPhone sales estimates have been raised by 7M and 10M to 236M and 218M.

At the same time, Hargreaves has cut his FY15 and FY16 Apple Watch sales estimates by 0.5M and 3M to 10.5M and 21M. "Store visits, Google search volume, third-party data and recent supply checks all suggest demand for Apple Watch has fallen sharply from initial levels." He previously noted Apple Watch Google search activity is trailing the iPod's. Research firm Slice has estimated 2.79M U.S. Watch sales as of mid-June.
With the iPhone accounting for the lion's share of Apple's gross profit, Hargreaves, who has maintained a Sector Perform rating since last September, has upped his FY15 and FY16 EPS estimates by $0.28 and $0.34 to $9.41 and $9.29. Consensus is at $9.03 and $9.72.
Separately, 9to5 Mac has leaked pictures said to depict the iPhone 6S' case and circuit board. The pictures indicate the 6S will use Qualcomm's (QCOM -0.2%) MDM9x35 baseband modem, first announced in late 2013 and found in some Galaxy S5/S6 units. It has twice the peak download speed (300Mbps) of the MDM9x25 modem used in the iPhone 6/6+, and better power consumption. The MDM9x45, which tops out at 450Mbps, was unveiled last November ahead of 2015 commercial availability.
In-line with Apple's past "S" model upgrades, the leaked photos suggest the 6S will look similar to the 6 on the outside. Any difference in thickness/width for 4.7" models is reportedly "too minimal to notice."

By a 2-1 vote, a federal appeals court has upheld a 2013 decision finding Apple (AAPL +0.6%) liable for conspiring with publishers to fix e-book prices. (the full ruling - .pdf).
Apple is now set to pay $450M - $400M to e-book consumers, $50M to lawyers - through a settlement originally announced last year. The settlement was contingent on the appeal being rejected; if Apple had won, the company would only be paying $70M. The WSJ notes the penalty is equal to less than 3% of Apple's FQ1 (December quarter) profit.
Separately, Apple Music, unveiled on June 8 at WWDC, has gone live with the release of iOS 8.4 (contains a revamped Music app), and so has the free/DJ-hosted Beats 1 global radio station. As previously announced, Apple is providing a free 3-month trial period for its music service, after which it charges $9.99/month to individuals and $14.99/month for family plans covering up to 6 people. An Android app arrives in the fall.
|Jun. 24, 2015, 11:21 AM|Apple gains following bullish Piper, Morgan Stanley iPhone notes



A study by Piper's Gene Munster of U.S. and Chinese iPhone resale values (on eBay and Alibaba's Taobao site, respectively) indicates the iPhone 6 and 6+ (AAPL +1.7%) are commanding higher prices than the 5S and 5C did a year ago.
Following 281 days of availability the 6 and 6+ are both selling in the U.S. at 72% of their MSRPs, compared with 60% and 48% from the 5S and 5C at the same point in time. Following 253 days in China, the 6 and 6+ are going for 73% of their MSRPs vs. 65% and 53% for the 5S and 5C at a similar point. Of note: iPhone 6/6+ anticipation (many rumors mentioned larger screens) may have affected year-ago 5S/5C resale prices.
Munster sees the numbers as evidence iPhone 6 demand remains strong. "We believe iPhone will continue to gain share at the high end smart phone market, which, despite tough comps starting in Dec-15, should move shares of AAPL higher."
Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty reports her firm's AlphaWise Tracker (relies on Web search data) indicates FQ3 (calendar Q2) iPhone end-user demand totals 53M, above consensus shipment estimates and an MS forecast of 50M. "This is unchanged from our read a month ago. Emerging markets, especially China, remain the driver of growth late in the product cycle."
Huberty also states AlphaWise indicates Apple Watch demand is ~20% above that or the original iPhone 6 weeks following its launch. "Net, we see the potential for improved distribution in C2H15 and improved Watch 2.0 features in 2016 to help capture demand implied by our recent AlphaWise survey and tracker data."
The iPhone accounted for 69% of Apple's FQ2 revenue, and a larger percentage of its gross profit. Today's gains come as the Nasdaq trades near breakeven.

Likewise, Digitimes reports Apple is working on iPhone models with "ultra-thin and ultra-narrow displays, and with a whole plane design eliminating the Home button." The site also states Apple is developing chips for the future iPhones that integrate a device's touch controller, display driver, and fingerprint sensor; iPhone LCD driver supplier Synaptics hasn't responded well to that report.
In addition to providing more screen real estate for a given form factor, eliminating the home button could enable thinner/lighter iPhone designs. AppleInsider speculates Apple could use Force Touch haptic sensors (expected to go into next-gen iPhones) to duplicate the home button's functionality, and notes many Android phones rely on digital input at the bottom of a display to do the job.

Digitimes reports Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is internally developing integrated touch controller/display driver (TDDI) ICs for use in future iPhones. The chips will also reportedly have integrated fingerprint sensors, and (notably) go into models sporting "a whole plane design eliminating the Home button."
Synaptics (NASDAQ:SYNA), generally seen as having an early tech lead in the TDDI IC market, is off sharply in early trading. The company officially launched its ClearPad 4191 and 4291 TDDI ICs in early March, while stating they've begun sampling with tier-1 OEMs.
Synaptics' recently-acquired Renesas SP Drivers driver IC unit has long been an iPhone supplier. Meanwhile, thanks to the Validity Sensors acquisition, Synaptics has become a major fingerprint sensor supplier for Android OEMs; the company has been working on integrated fingerprint/touch sensor solutions.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has reversed its policy and said it would now pay artists during the free three-month trial of its new streaming music service, after pop star Taylor Swift threatened to hold back her latest album "1989" from Apple Music.
"When I woke up this morning and read Taylor’s note, it really solidified that we need to make a change," Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet software and services, said in an interview late Sunday.
Apple's free trial period is seen as a crucial part of the company's strategy to attract paying subscribers.

Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) is now up 65% from its $20 IPO price, and 8% from a post-IPO opening trade of $30.40. The valuation stands at $6.7B.

Jim Cramer has argued shares are worth buying up to $35-$38, given Fitbit's profitability and (taking growth rates into account) reasonable forward P/E. The WSJ's Dan Gallagher has also provided a positive take. "[S]ingle-use devices can still compete against multifunction ones like Apple Watch (NASDAQ:AAPL), if they excel at their stated purpose at a much lower price point ... Fitbit’s average selling price over the last four quarters was about $72 per device, which is just a fifth of the Apple Watch’s starting price ... valuation suggests Fitbit has some room to run in the near term." Of note: Many Android Wear watches are much cheaper than the Apple Watch, though generally not as cheap as Fitbit's offerings.
While making the rounds yesterday, CEO James Park insisted Fitbit's fitness bands and activity trackers can coexist with smartwatches. "It’s not one or the other. People have a lot of different preferences."

Apple (AAPL +0.6%) currently plans to have a camera built into the second-gen Watch's front bezel to let users make and receive FaceTime video calls, reports 9to5 Mac's Mark Gurman in his latest iScoop. He adds Apple's recently-unveiled watchOS 2.0 (will launch this fall) "allows users to answer FaceTime Audio calls from the Apple Watch, as well as route FaceTime video calls to either be answered on an iPhone or rejected."
The device will also reportedly be able to receive texts, e-mails, and other data solely through its Wi-Fi radio. The current Apple Watch requires Bluetooth or Wi-Fi pairing with an iPhone.
The battery is expected to be similar to the current Watch's, with Apple turning to "more advanced hardware features" to improve battery life. While reviewers have been critical of battery life, Gurman reports Apple's research indicates "average consumers finish each day with between 30% and 40% charge remaining on their Apple Watches." Apple has officially estimated the Watch's battery lasts 18 hours under "typical" use.
Also: Apple is reportedly "exploring a wider portfolio of Apple Watch models beyond today’s Sport, Steel, and Edition tiers," while "looking at ways to attract customers at price points between $1,000 and $10,000." In-line with Apple's traditional upgrade cycles, the second-gen Watch is deemed "most likely" to arrive in 2016.
Separately, research firm Slice (relying on e-commerce receipts) estimates U.S. Watch sales totaled 2.79M as of mid-June, up moderately from an estimated ~2.5M as of May 18. The Apple Watch Sport (starts at $349) is believed to be the most popular model, and an estimated 17% of owners bought more than one (high-margin) band.

 TechCrunch states Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has been stepping up its efforts to grow enterprise sales, is working with enterprise mobility management (EMM) software vendor MobileIron (NASDAQ:MOBL) to "help deploy applications into the enterprise." Details about the tie-up are vague. MobileIron CEO Bob Tinker tells TechCrunch his company is "excited to be working with Apple," and makes note of his company's OneTouch iOS app-deployment/management software. Apple, of course, announced an enterprise-focused partnership with IBM last July; since then, IBM has launched.a number of industry-specific iOS apps. MobileIron (along with BlackBerry) sold off hard when the Apple/IBM alliance was announced. |Jun. 11, 2015, 10:42 AM|Criteo -5.6%; Apple plans to support ad-blockers on Mobile Safari


"The new Safari release brings Content Blocking Safari Extensions to iOS. Content Blocking gives your extensions a fast and efficient way to block cookies, images, resources, pop-ups, and other content," writes Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its developer documentation for iOS 9 (launching this fall).

StatCounter estimates Safari had a 24.9% global mobile/tablet browsing share in May, trailing only Google Chrome's 30.8% ... and Safari's share of the high-income consumers beloved by advertisers is likely larger, given Apple's customer demographics.
Content publishers aren't thrilled with Apple's plans to support 3rd-party ad-blockers. NiemanLab's Joshua Benton: "Publishers already make tiny dollars on mobile, even as their readers have shifted there in huge numbers ... If iOS users — the majority of mobile web users in the U.S., and disproportionately appealing demographically — can suddenly block all your ads with a simple free download, where is the growth going to come from?"
Benton also notes Apple's support for cookie-blocking could prevent content paywalls from working. At the same time, he admits "bandwidth and performance and battery life are all at a premium" on mobile, and that many ads act as a big resource drain.
Criteo (NASDAQ:CRTO), whose e-commerce ad platform relies on cookies to deliver retargeted ads to users on PC and mobile sites, is selling off (hat tip: Marc Lehman). Other ad tech plays don't appear to be affected much by the news for now. Apple's move follows remarks by Tim Cook arguing Apple places a greater value on consumer privacy and data protection than Google and other rivals. Android already supports ad-blockers.

The attorneys general of New York and Connecticut are now investigating whether the deals struck by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for its new music service violated antitrust rules.
The joint investigation will probe whether Apple pressured music labels - or whether the labels conspired with Apple and one another - to withdraw support for popular "freemium" services like Spotify in favor of its new paid streaming music service.
Eric Schneiderman and Connecticut's George Jepsen were also among a group of attorneys generals who in 2013 sued Apple for conspiring to raise the prices of e-books. Apple agreed to pay $450M as part of that settlement.

 The much-rumored Apple Music (AAPL -0.5%) subscription service has been unveiled, and so has a radio station (Beats 1) featuring live DJs. Jimmy Iovine trumpets Apple Music's emphasis on human curation (algorithms will also be used), and a service (called Music Connect) meant to connect fans with artists. Apple Music will launch on June 30 in over 100 countries, and come with a 3-month free trial. Beyond that, it costs $9.99/month for individual plans (similar to rivals), and $14.99/month for family plans (up to 6 members). Android support arrives in the fall. Pandora (P -3.4%) remains lower on the day. Apple's iOS 9 News app aims to take on Flipboard and other mobile reader apps with the help of curated content from partners such as ESPN, Conde Nast, BuzzFeed, the NYT, Bloomberg, and The Verge. Much like other reader apps, News will analyze reading habits to better personalize content over time. Confirming a May rumor, the iPad is getting multitasking support via iOS 9: Swiping or pulling down an app from the side brings up other apps (SlideOver), with iPad Air 2 users (and perhaps in the future ~12" iPad users?) also able to simultaneously work on two apps (SplitView). Also: A picture-in-picture mode for video is also being added. watchOS 2 supports native 3rd-paty apps, lets Apple Watch users create various custom photo faces, and lets developers create "Complications" that mash up different types of info. New Siri controls are also included, as is an updated Mail app and a Nightstand Mode. Other announcements: 1) Apple Pay is adding support for retail rewards cards. 2) CarPlay is adding wireless support, and HomeKit support for more home devices. 3) The Maps app is being updated to support public transit directions. 4) Apple has unveiled the next-gen version of its Swift programming language (Swift 2), and is making Swift open-source. 5) Cumulative App Store downloads have topped 100B; Apple states the average user has 119 apps. As expected, iOS 9 will officially launch in the fall (i.e. the time that new iPhones typically launch). watchOS 2 also formally launches in the fall.

Apple (AAPL -0.9%) has kicked off WWDC by unveiling Mac OS X 10.11 (codenamed El Capitan). The OS contains a slew of nuts-and-bolts UI and feature improvements, such as cursor and Spotlight search panel resizing, the auto-arranging of app windows (similar to Windows' Snap feature), and natural-language search integration.
Performance gains are also promised: Apple claims apps launch up to 40% faster than on OS X Yosemite, and (with the help of the Metal GPU API) graphics rendering efficiency is improved up to 40%. A developer beta is available today; a public beta arrives in July, and the OS becomes officially available as a free upgrade in the fall.
The rumored Proactive assistant (a part of iOS 9) has been unveiled. The Google Now rival leverages Siri and a user's data to push time/location-sensitive content, and make content/app suggestions. Meanwhile, an API is being provided for Spotlight (integrated with Proactive) to allow content within apps to be surfaced. Google has long been a supporter of the concept, known as deep linking.
Confirming a recent Telegraph report, Apple Pay will launch in the U.K. next month. In addition, mobile card-reader giant Square will launch a new reader this fall that supports Apple Pay. Trader Joe's and J.C. Penney have been added to the list of merchants supporting the platform.
Also: 1) As rumored, Apple is adding support for native 3rd-party Watch apps (i.e. apps that don't need iPhone pairing) through a new Watch SDK. 2) Tim Cook states 55% of active Mac users are now on Yosemite (launched last year). 3) Bloomberg reports Apple (already known to be building out a CDN) is building a long-haul fiber network to connect its data centers, in order to speed content delivery. 4) Apple's Passbook app has been renamed Wallet.

Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) new mobile phone payment service, Android Pay, will not garner any transaction fees from credit card companies, WSJ reports, possibly putting pressure on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to drop or lower its charges for Apple Pay.
Dominant payment networks, Visa (NYSE:V) MasterCard (NYSE:MA), recently standardized their "tokenization" card-security service and made it free, preventing payment services from charging fees to issuers.
"This is a bold move on behalf of the banks," said Rick Oglesby, head of research at Double Diamond Payments Research. After agreeing to Apple's terms for Apple Pay, "they’re now taking a stand against similar deals. It could easily turn into a standoff."
Apple Pay currently receives 0.15% of the value of each credit card transaction and collects a half-cent per purchase on bank debit cards.

Ahead of the Apple Watch's (NASDAQ:AAPL) April launch, fitness band/activity tracker leader Fitbit (FIT - about to go public) had 34.2% of the market in Q1, according to IDC. The estimate relies on Fitbit's reported Q1 device shipments of 3.9M (+129% Y/Y).
Chinese smartphone vendor Xiaomi, whose Mi Band has fared well in the Middle Kingdom, is believed to be the second-biggest vendor (24.6% share, 2.8M units).
Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN), which reported 31% Y/Y Q1 sales growth for its fitness segment (makes smartwatches and fitness bands, some of which are GPS-enabled), came in at #3 with a 6.1% share and 700K units. Samsung (5.3%) and Jawbone (4.4%, recently sued Fitbit) round out the top 5.

Starting in two weeks, some Apple Watch (AAPL -0.1%) models will be available for sale at retail Apple Stores; Watch sales have been online-only to date. By June 26, the Watch will also be available in 7 more countries - Italy, Mexico, Singapore, Spain, South Korea, Taiwan, and Switzerland - and at "select Apple Authorized resellers." It originally launched in the U.S., China, Hong Kong Japan, the U.K., France, Germany, and Canada.
Operations SVP Jeff Williams: "The response to Apple Watch has surpassed our expectations in every way ... We're also making great progress with the backlog of Apple Watch orders ... All orders placed through May, with the sole exception of Apple Watch 42 mm Space Black Stainless Steel with Space Black Link Bracelet, will ship to customers within two weeks."
Many initial Watch buyers saw lengthy shipping times. The WSJ reported in April a component defect at one of two taptic engine suppliers hurt availability, and suggested production could improve in June as taptic supplier Nidec (the one not seeing the defect) ramps production.
Apple still hasn't provided formal sales figures for the Watch. Research firm Slice has estimated U.S. sales totaled nearly 2.5M through May 18.

The NYT and Re/code both report Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has cancelled plans to unveil a revamped Apple TV set-top at WWDC (June 8-12). Sources tell the NYT Apple planned as recently as mid-May to reveal the set-top, along with a new remote and developer SDK, but changed its mind "partly because the product was not ready for prime time."
BuzzFeed's John Paczkowski reported in March Apple planned to reveal the set-top at WWDC. He added the device would feature App Store, Siri, and HomeKit support, run on an A8 CPU, and provide "a dramatic increase" in storage relative to the current Apple TV's 8GB.
Re/code recently reported Apple won't announce its rumored Web TV service at WWDC on account of licensing deals having not yet been finalized. Past reports indicated Apple would announce the service at WWDC, and begin programming in the fall.

As with competitor HBO Now (NYSE:TWX), the service will launch on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices (for the moment) and will be timed in conjunction with key series -- in Showtime's case, new seasons of Ray Donovan and Masters of Sex.
 It's priced at $10.99/month -- a $4 undercut from HBO Now's $14.99 -- and will offer the live coastal Showtime feeds and unlimited on-demand access to Showtime's original series along with hundreds of hours of movie and sports programming. July signups will get a 30-day free trial. “Going over-the-top means Showtime will be much more accessible to tens of millions of potential new subscribers,” says CBS CEO Les Moonves. “Across CBS, we are constantly finding new ways to monetize our programming by capitalizing on opportunities presented by technology." |Jun. 1, 2015, 3:18 PM|WSJ: Apple pricing music service at $10/month, updating iTunes Radio


Apple (AAPL +0.4%) is expected to unveil its new subscription music streaming service (a revamped version of the existing Beats Music service) at the June 8-12 WWDC conference, the WSJ reports.
It adds the service will be priced at $10/month, on par with Spotify and many other rival services. Prior reports indicated Apple was hoping to undercut rivals, potentially by charging ~$8/month. A 9to5 Mac report also stated the service would be offered through both the iOS Music app and a standalone Android app (the first developed by Apple).
Also: Apple plans to update its iTunes Radio service (available either on a free/ad-supported basis, or for $25/year ad-free via iTunes Match) to include "channels programmed and hosted by human DJs." Pandora (P -2%) has fallen moderately in response.
Apple reportedly hasn't yet reached licensing deals for the subscription service with Universal Music, Sony, and Warner Music, but the WSJ adds "many in the music industry expect such deals soon."
Nielsen SoundScan estimates paid U.S. music downloads of albums and songs respectively fell 9% and 12% in 2014, and that streaming usage rose 54%. The WSJ's music industry sources estimate Apple accounts for 80%-85% of global paid music download sales.

9to5 Mac reports Apple (AAPL +1.8%) is "readying a major new iOS initiative codenamed 'Proactive,' which will leverage Siri, Contacts, Calendar, Passbook, and third-party apps to create a viable competitor to Google Now (GOOG +1.1%)."
Proactive will reportedly replace Apple's Spotlight search feature - a dedicated search bar will be included - and be placed to the left of a user's Home screen. Like Now, it will rely on data from various apps to push timely info to a user. The service will also integrate with Apple Maps to "display personally relevant points of interest using an augmented reality interface," and have a UI that "automatically populates with content based around three key parts of iOS: Apps, Contacts, and Maps."
Also: 1) In addition to an augmented reality view, Maps will be given a "Browse Around Me" button that shows points of interest on an overhead map. 2) A Siri API codenamed Breadcrumbs will be provided to 3rd-party developers; its features will be limited due to privacy concerns.
The report comes less than a year after Apple replaced Google with Bing as Spotlight's default search provider via iOS 8; Google remains the Safari browser's default provider.  Sources tell 9to5 Google's iOS traffic has dropped since the iOS 8 launch.
Other news: 1) Google announces it's updating its iOS search app (features Now) to integrate with and pull data from 3rd-party apps such as OpenTable; its Android search app already supports this. 2) During a Code Conference talk, Apple operations chief Jeff Williams states Apple Watch developers will soon be able to write native apps (iPhone app pairing is currently required) and have direct sensor access. 3) CBS CEO Les Moonves says he recently met with Apple to do a TV service deal, and that a deal will "probably" happen.

Re/code, which was the first to report Apple (AAPL +0.8%) plans to launch a Web TV service, now reports Apple wants to include "widespread access" to local U.S. TV channels, a feature not provided by Dish and Sony's offerings.
Apple's efforts are said to have "complicated its negotiations with the broadcast TV networks, because most broadcasters don’t own all their local stations." Some execs also state broadcasters will have to invest in streaming infrastructure to support local feeds.
As a result, the service might not launch in early fall, the target date Apple has given programmers. However, TV execs think it will eventually launch, and that money (rather than technical issues) is the main hurdle. The WSJ reported earlier this week Apple hopes to unveil the service at WWDC next month ahead of a fall launch.
Separately, research firm Slice estimates (based on an analysis of online sales receipts) U.S. Apple Watch orders have generally been below 30K/day (implies a quarterly run rate of ~2.7M) following big early sales. Altogether, Slice thinks Apple sold nearly 2.5M Watches in the U.S. from April 10 (the day pre-orders started) through May 18.
KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo recently cut his 2015 Apple Watch shipment forecast to 15M (others have forecast 20M-30M), citing a lack of major changes to shipment times in spite of supply constraints. Kuo also estimated ~80% of Watch orders are for the larger 42mm models.

9to5 Mac (has a good track record with Apple product scoops) reports Apple (AAPL +1.1%) is prepping Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi/4G 12" iPad models (codenamed J98 and J99), and also plans to give its tablet line support for dual-app (split-screen) viewing and multi-user login.
Dual-app viewing, a feature long supported by Samsung's Galaxy Note tablet/phone line, will reportedly be baked into iOS 9 and possibly shown off at WWDC (runs from June 8-12). The 12" iPads and multi-user login are expected to arrive later. The dual-app mode (useful for business multitasking) will reportedly include support for 1/2, 1/3, and 2/3 views, depending on the app.
Bloomberg reported in March Apple had delayed production of a 12.9" iPad (expected to be aimed at businesses and creative pros) to "around September" due to panel supply issues. Past rumors have stated Apple is thinking of including a stylus accessory and USB 3.0 ports; Apple just filed a patent application for a stylus whose input adjusts based on factors such as pressure and grip.
Apple is coming off an FQ2 in which iPad revenue fell 29% Y/Y to $5.4B, and units 23% to 12.6M. Tim Cook defended the business on Apple's earnings call, noting a large portion of iPad sales still go to first-time buyers.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will follow up on its use of OLED displays for the Apple Watch by launching iPhones and iPads sporting OLEDs in the 2016/2017 timeframe, argues The Motley Fool's Steve Symington in a column today.
Symington notes Apple has reportedly contracted Foxconn and Innolux to build a $2.6B plant to make flexible OLEDs for both smartphones and wearables, and that a JV launched by Japan Display, Sony, and Panasonic (known as JOLED) has reportedly been contracted by Apple to produce OLEDs for next-gen iPads.
Universal Display (OLED +2.2%) has made fresh highs, and is now up 89% YTD. Shares jumped two weeks ago after the company disclosed a $45M Q/Q increase in its deferred revenue balance within its Q1 report.
Also: LG Display (LPL +0.9%) recently showed off a 55" OLED panel prototype that's only 0.97mm thick - far thinner than its existing 55" panel (4.3mm). The prototype weighs only 1.9kg, and can be stuck to a wall using a magnetic mat.
LG, which struck a new licensing deal with Universal earlier this year, says it plans to ramp OLED production in Q3, and is respectively aiming for 2015 and 2016 unit shipments of 600K and 1.5M.

But it ultimately decided the TV's features wouldn't be "compelling enough" to enter a highly competitive market. A small team working on a set was "disbanded with members sent off to work with different product areas." At the same time, the WSJ backs up past reports about Apple's plans to launch a Web TV service supported by a new Apple TV set-top. Sources state Apple hopes to unveil both the TV service and set-top in June (presumably at WWDC, runs from June 8-12) before starting programming in the fall. However, the TV service's unveiling could depend on progress with media companies. Carl Icahn might need to change his model. On Monday morning, the activist predicted (while giving his reasons for setting a $240 target) Apple would launch a TV set in FY16 and sell $37.5B worth of them in FY17. Steve Jobs told biographer Walter Isaacson he wanted to create "an integrated television set that is easy to use," and that he had "finally cracked" the problem of a building a quality UI. But he also reportedly told employees TVs were "a terrible business" due to their low margins and upgrade rates. |May 18, 2015, 11:52 AM|Icahn hikes Apple target to $240, sees FY16 EPS of $12


Carl Icahn's latest Apple (AAPL +1.1%) target (disclosed in a new letter) is up $24 from a $216 target set in February, and $37 from a $203 target set in October.
Whereas Icahn's $216 target was based on a multiple of 20x expected FY15 (ends Sep. '15) EPS of $9.70 + $22/share in net cash, his $240 target is based on 18x expected FY16 EPS of $12.00 (exc. net interest income) + $24.44/share in net cash. The FY16 estimate, well above a $9.64 consensus, assumes a 20% tax rate rather than Apple's reported 26.2% "effective" tax rate (recognizes taxes on offshore profits).
Icahn, optimistic as ever: "Considering our forecast for 30% EPS growth in FY 2017 and our belief Apple will soon enter two new markets (Television and the Automobile) with a combined addressable market size of $2.2 trillion, we think a multiple of 18x is a very conservative premium ... we believe the company’s shares should trade at a premium multiple to the S&P 500, as opposed to the S&P 500 trading at a 60% premium to Apple."
He sees iPhone sales growth falling to the single digits in FY16/17, but also expects iPad growth to resume and Apple Watch sales to hit $45B in FY17. Though Apple hasn't announced a TV set (nor has one been reported to be close), $37.5B worth of FY17 TV sales are forecast.
Not surprisingly, Icahn once more calls for a larger buyback - Apple recently hiked its buyback authorization by $50B to $140B, and raised $8B to help pay for capital returns. "[D]espite more than 30% growth in R&D annually through FY 2017 to $13.5 billion ... and your updated capital return program, Apple’s net cash position (currently the largest of any company in history) will continue to build on the balance sheet."

A federal appeals court (the CAFC) has upheld the patent infringement violations found by a San Jose jury in Apple's (AAPL +0.4%) 2012 infringement suit against Samsung (OTC:SSNLF). However, it has reversed the $382M in trade dress dilution damages awarded to Apple (part of the $930M awarded overall), which will now be reconsidered by the San Jose court.Apple and Samsung's bitter legal war has been gradually dying down: Last year, the companies agreed to drop all suits outside of the U.S. That occurred shortly after Apple was awarded $120M in a U.S. infringement suit (separate from the 2012 complaint), much less than the $2B it originally sought.Separately, Whale Wisdom's Daniel Collins reports (following a review of Q1 13F filings) the number of Apple shares held by firms with over $100M under management fell by 4% in Q1 to 3.38B. 1,064 firms cut their positions, and 862 added to theirs; 121 created new positions, and 69 closed out.David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital and Philippe Laffont's Coatue Management were among the major hedge funds to cut their Apple stakes. Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors liquidated its stake, while Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates upped its position. Carl Icahn's position was unchanged at 52.8M shares.Overall, 2,193 13F filers owned $421B worth of Apple shares - both figures are market highs. 1,186 firms counted Apple as a top-10 holding.|May 18, 2015, 12:58 AM|Apple buys high-precision GPS service firm Coherent Navigation


Coherent Navigation provided high-precision GPS services (known as iGPS) that pair standard GPS signals with those from Iridium's (NASDAQ:IRDM) low-earth orbit satellite constellation to offer superior accuracy, signal integrity, and jamming protection. Whereas standard GPS is typically accurate to within several meters, Iridium and Boeing have claimed iGPS  can be accurate to within centimeters.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has bought Coherent for an undisclosed sum. The purchase  follows several 2013 acquisitions aimed at improving Apple Maps: Wi-Fi indoor positioning startup WiFiSlam, business/POI location database provider Locationary, commercial mapping services firm BroadMap, and public transit app developers HopStop, and Embark. More recently, Apple appears to have launched an effort to add street imagery similar to Google Maps' Street View.
Tim Cook disclosed in March Apple had bought 26 companies in the prior 15 months. As a list of Apple's known acquisitions shows, many of the purchases still haven't been made public.
|May 14, 2015, 1:44 PM|Apple +2.1%; UBS reports strong iPhone checks (updated)

 "The UBS Evidence Lab iPhone Monitor initially pegs June quarter iPhone (NASDAQ:AAPL) demand at 51.1mn units, above the Street consensus estimate of about 45mn," says analyst Steve Milunovich (Buy rating). Noting the model tries to gauge consumer sell-through rather than channel sell-in (i.e. what Apple records), Milunovich now expects 48M FQ3 (calendar Q2) iPhone sales, up from a prior 43M, and has hiked his FQ3 EPS estimate by $0.13 to $1.93. Unsurprisingly (given recent numbers), Milunovich reports Chinese demand is particularly strong. "Our model considers historical shipment data from 20 different countries and regions for which Google search values are established to forecast near-term demand. The data through May 2 estimates 23% YoY growth in global search volume and indicates continued strength in China with more than a 100% estimated search volume increase ... The model tends to overweight Greater China ... but has been directionally correct." Separately, Fortune reports Apple has delayed the launch of its HomeKit home automation platform "from an anticipated May or June time-frame to something closer to late August or September." HomeKit was first unveiled last June at WWDC with a slew of launch partners. A source says the code base related to the process for signing into HomeKit and making devices Web-connected "blew up" and required too much memory for smaller devices. Apple (hasn't announced a HomeKit launch date) is reportedly "trying to shrink the code back down to size." Shares are rallying amid a 1.3% gain for the Nasdaq. They're ~$6 below a high of $134.54.

Update: Apple says the first HomeKit devices will be launched by partners in June. |May 13, 2015, 11:50 AM|Report: TSMC to produce Apple's SSD controller chips



Digitimes reports TSMC (TSM +0.2%) has landed orders from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to produce SSD controller ICs for the company. The chips will reportedly be made using TSMC's older 28nm manufacturing process - Apple's A8 CPU is made using TSMC's 20nm process, and the A9 is expected to rely on a next-gen 16nm process (along with Samsung's 14nm process).
In addition to the A8, TSMC manufactures Apple's Touch ID fingerprint sensors, and acts as a foundry for a variety of Apple chip suppliers (Qualcomm, Broadcom, Cirrus Logic, etc.). The company's SSD controller clients include market leader Marvell and Taiwan's Phison Electronics.
Back in 2011, Apple bought Anobit, an Israeli maker of high-performance flash controllers, for a reported $390M.
|May 11, 2015, 2:17 PM|Chinese smartphone sales fall in Q1; Apple's share jumps to 14.7%


After growing 19.1% Y/Y in Q4 (and seeing stronger growth earlier in 2014),  Chinese smartphone shipments fell 4.3% in Q1 to 98.8M units, per IDC. Higher penetration rates, carrier subsidy cuts, and an inventory buildup near the end of 2014 contributed to the drop.
IDC: "China is oftentimes thought of as an emerging market but the reality is that the vast majority of phones sold in China today are smartphones ... convincing existing users as well as feature phone users to upgrade to new smartphones will now be the key to further growth in the China market."
Analysts have already noted Chinese smartphone demand has softened. Demand is expected to improve in 2H15, as inventories are cleared and 4G phone sales continue growing. IDC expects "relatively flat" growth for the whole of 2015.
With strong pent-up demand for larger iPhones providing a lift, IDC estimates Apple's (AAPL -0.9%) share rose to 14.7% (#1 overall) from 12.3% in Q4 and 8.7% a year ago, via 14.5M shipments (+62% Y/Y). Revenue share was likely well over 30%, given sub-$150 Android phones account for a large portion of local sales. Apple, for its part, has reported its Greater China revenue (iPhone or otherwise) rose 71% Y/Y in Q1 to $16.8B (29% of total revenue).
Xiaomi continues growing rapidly: IDC estimates its share rose to 13.7% (#2) from 9.2% a year ago. Fellow local Android OEM Huawei saw its share rise to 11.4% (#3) from 7.8%. Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), however, saw its share fall to 9.7% from 19.9% ahead of the Galaxy S6 launch. Lenovo/Motorola's (OTCPK:LNVGY) share fell to 8.3% (#5) from 10.3%. Everyone else had 42.2% of the market.
|May 7, 2015, 12:49 PM|Apple sells $8B worth of debt for dividends/buybacks


Three months after selling $6.5B worth of debt, Apple (AAPL +0.8%) has sold another $8B, while stating it plans to use the proceeds to help pay for dividends/buybacks.
Interest rates were low, but (thanks to a bond market selloff) higher than the rates often obtained in prior deals: Whereas 30-year (2045) bonds sold in February were priced to yield 3.498% (125 bps above comparable Treasurys), 30-year bonds sold in the latest offering were priced to yield 4.397% (140 bps above comparable Treasurys). 2017, 2020, 2022, and 2025 notes have also been offered. (prospectus)
The offering comes after Apple hiked its quarterly dividend by 11% to $0.52/share last week, and upped its buyback authorization by $50B to $140B. The company had $193.5B in cash/investments at the end of March, but over $171B was offshore. Debt totaled nearly $44B.
SA author Rubicon Associates considers the debt attractive relative to offerings from blue-chip tech peers, and (based on an analysis of Apple's peer credit curve) views the 2022 and 2025 notes as the most attractive. "Bottom line: I find the new debt cheap to peers and existing Apple debt."

iPhone/iPad combo chip supplier Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM) is providing a Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/NFC/FM radio combo chip for the Apple Watch (NASDAQ:AAPL), according to an ABI Research teardown of the Watch's S1 chip module. As expected, NXP supplies a complementary NFC controller.
The teardown also uncovered a 6-axis STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) motion sensor (accelerometer/gyproscope). There has been some debate about whether InvenSense (NYSE:INVN) will be a motion sensor supplier for the Watch, as it is for the iPhone 6.
Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) supplies a touch controller IC. Barclays reported in March ADI had scored multiple design wins to enable Apple's Force Touch pressure-based response feature (supported by the Watch) on future iPhones/iPads.
IDT (NASDAQ:IDTI) supplies a wireless charging IC. The design win comes after Samsung opted to use a Texas Instruments charging IC within the Galaxy S6; IDC supplies a chip for the S6's charging pad. Dialog Semi (OTC:DLGNF) provides a power management chip.
SanDisk/Toshiba (NASDAQ:SNDK) supply an 8GB NAND flash chip, and Micron/Elpida (NASDAQ:MU) a 4Gb (512MB) SRAM chip. SRAM typically carries higher ASPs than DRAM for a given amount of capacity (it's also faster).
In the near-term (and perhaps longer), Watch volumes will likely amount to a small fraction of iPhone volumes - whereas Apple sold 192.7M iPhones in 2014, IDC forecasts 15.9M 2015 Watch shipments, and more bullish estimates are still generally in the ~20M range. However, strong growth is expected over the next several years, and the first-gen Watch serves as a valuable reference win when competing for other smartwatch/wearable designs.
|Apr. 29, 2015, 6:21 PM|Apple roundup: Watch component defect, tax disclosure, smartphone share



The WSJ reports AAC Technologies, one of the two suppliers of the Apple Watch's (NASDAQ:AAPL) taptic engine (enables its haptic feedback features) was making defective components, and thus slowed down the ramping of Watch production. No recall is planned, since Apple doesn't believe Watches with the defective part shipped to consumers.
Apple has reportedly responded by moving nearly all of its taptic engine production to Japan's Nidec, which didn't encounter the same issue. However, the WSJ states "it may take time" for Nidec to up production, and that Apple told some Watch suppliers last week to "slow production until June."
The report comes as shipping times for many Watch models remain lengthy; a survey from research firm Slice indicated only 22% of U.S. Watch orders were delivered during the first weekend (376K out of 1.7M).
In its FQ2 10-Q, Apple discloses the European Commission "could require Ireland to recover from the Company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years," and that such tax payments could be "material." The EC has long been probing the use of Irish legal structures by Apple and other U.S. multinationals to lower their local tax bills; the FT reported last year Apple could receive a fine of up to several billions of euros.

IDC estimates Apple's 61.2M calendar Q1 iPhone sales were good for an 18.2% global smartphone unit share, up from 15.2% a year ago; revenue share is likely above 40%. Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) had an estimated 24.5% unit share (82.4M shipments), down from 30.7% a year ago. #3 Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) fell to 5.6% from 6.6% after factoring the Motorola Mobility deal.
Overall, IDC thinks smartphone shipments rose 16.7% Y/Y to 336.5M. The total mobile phone market was roughly flat at 458.9M units.
|Apr. 28, 2015, 12:11 PM|Apple gets target hikes, Icahn praise after FQ2 beat


Apple (AAPL +0.3%) is up slightly after beating FQ2 estimates, offering in-line FQ3 guidance, and upping its dividend and buyback authorization. At least 9 firms have hiked their targets; no upgrades or downgrades have arrived.
Brean's Ananda Baruah (target hiked to $170) thinks Street estimates remain "materially low" through 2017, given iPhone unit growth, the margin boost provided by a mix shift towards iPhones and (within iPhone sales) the 6+, and operating expense leverage. He forecasts iPhone shipments and EPS respectively rising to 285M and $12.73 by FY17 (ends Sep. '17).
Citi's Jim Suva, who added Apple to Citi's Focus List 4 weeks ago, still sees carrier upgrade plans, low multiples, margin expansion, Apple Pay/Passbook, and enterprise growth acting as catalysts. Canaccord's Mike Walkley (target hiked to $155) sees the iPhone installed base growing to 500M this year.
Those offering more cautious takes often question the sustainability of iPhone growth. Nomura states sales growth in developed markets appears to have fallen in half in FQ2, and expects Chinese growth to slow the way Japanese growth has. Raymond James' Tavis McCourt (recently downgraded to Market Perform) also expects slowing iPhone growth, and (given a $171B+ offshore cash balance) thinks major foreign acquisitions are possible in the absence of a tax holiday.
Returning to Twitter after a 5-week hiatus, Carl Icahn says he still considers Apple "undervalued and misunderstood," and expects to "put out another in-depth report within two weeks." His last report (involved a $216 target) was published in February.

About 20% of the iPhone installed base has upgraded to the iPhone 6/6 Plus, Tim Cook states on the FQ2 call. He adds Apple has seen a higher rate of switchers from other platforms than in previous iPhone cycles, and that a large number of first-time buyers of the iPhone (69% of FQ2 revenue) still come from emerging markets. (live blogs: BI, WSJ)
No numbers have been given for early Apple Watch sales. Cook does note demand is higher than supply (previous), and that over 3,500 Watch apps are now available. "Customer response is close to 100% positive from what I've seen." The device will is expected to launch in more markets in late June.
Cook also talked up Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Chinese performance (Greater China sales +71% and 29% of total revenue). In addition to iPhone 6 sales, local demand was lifted by higher Mac and (in spite of weakness elsewhere) iPad sales, and a 100%+ increase in Chinese App Store revenue. 70% of Chinese iPad buyers and 40% of U.S. buyers are first-time.
Multiple analysts asked about Apple's FQ3 gross margin guidance (38.5%-39.5% vs. a year-ago GM of 39.4%) CFO Luca Maestri states Watch margins (below the company average for now) will have an impact, as will a strong dollar (affecting many U.S. multinationals).
Other details: 1) Over $171B of Apple's $193.5B cash/investment balance is offshore. 2) iPhone channel inventory rose by 1M Q/Q, but is at the low end of Apple's target range. iPad inventory fell by 1.1M. 3) Cook thinks the iPhone and Mac are cannibalizing iPad sales. 4) Total emerging markets revenue (much of it from China) was up 58% Y/Y.

 With strong iPhone sales (and perhaps also lower memory prices) providing a lift, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had an FQ2 gross margin of 40.8%, up 150 bps Y/Y and above guidance of 38.5%-39.5%. FQ3 GM guidance is at 38.5%-39.5%. 
Product line performance: iPhone revenue (69% of total revenue) +55% Y/Y to $40.3B; units +40%. iPad -29% to $5.4B; units -23%. Mac +2% to $5.6B; units +10%. Services (iTunes, App Store, AppleCare, Apple Pay, etc.) +9% to $5B. Other products (iPod, Apple TV, Beats) -10% to $1.7B. 
Regional performance: Americas revenue +19% to $21.3B. Europe +12% to $12.2B. Greater China +71% to $16.8B. Japan -15% to $3.5B. Rest of Asia-Pac +48% to $4.2B. International sales were 69% of revenue, up from FQ1's 65%. iPhone ASP was $659, down from FQ1's $687 but up from FQ4's $603 (iPhone 6 Plus boost). iPad ASP was $430 vs. $419 in FQ1 and $432 in FQ4. Mac ASP was $1,231 vs. $1,258 in FQ1 and $1,200 in FQ4. GAAP SG&A spend rose 18% Y/Y to $3.46B. R&D spend rose 35% to $1.92B. $7B was spent on buybacks, up from FQ1's $5B. Apple ended FQ2 with over $193B in cash/investments (much of it offshore), and nearly $44B in debt. Apple's increased quarterly dividend of $0.52/share is good for a yield of 1.5% at current levels. The next dividend is payable on May 14 to shareholders on record as of the May 11 close.

Apple (AAPL -0.5%) is "in negotiations with Canada’s six biggest banks about a potential November launch" of Apple Pay, the WSJ reports. As in the U.S., both credit and debit cards would be supported.
However, Canadian banks are said to be unhappy with Apple's fee proposals and "concerned about security vulnerabilities like the ones that U.S. banks experienced as they rolled out the service." Talks are ongoing.
Canalys estimates the iPhone has a third of the Canadian smartphone market. Thus far, Apple Pay has only launched in the U.S.; in February, MarketWatch reported talks with state-owned Chinese credit/debit card operator UnionPay had stalled. Talks with U.K. banks (and bank concerns about data collection) were reported in December.
With Apple reportedly getting $0.15 on every $100 of credit transactions (and half a cent on debit transactions), Apple Pay is seen less as a direct revenue growth driver than as a means of strengthening the iOS ecosystem and boosting customer loyalty. The company has made plenty of positive remarks about early usage, but hasn't broken out total transaction volumes.
Separately, FBR's Daniel Ives has launched coverage with an Outperform rating and $185 target. He sees a growing services focus, rising Chinese and enterprise penetration, and new device categories (inc. wearables) acting as growth drivers, and argues Apple's software differentiation should help it achieve a $1T market cap in the face of mobile hardware commoditization.
Ives: "Apple attracts its customers by leveraging the benefits of its closed software ecosystem ... Overall, while we estimate 24% and 6% [Y/Y] revenue growth for FY15 and FY16, respectively, we believe Apple can improve its strong market position and impressive gross margins over the coming years."

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has bought LinX Computational Imaging, an Israeli developer of multi-sensor mobile camera modules declared (by LinX) to deliver SLR-level image quality and superior low-light shots. The WSJ reports the purchase price is ~$20M.
Aside from high image quality, LinX trumpets the ability of its array sensor modules to take multiple shots at the same time at different apertures. This, together with algorithms, enables depth sensing and 3D image capture, as well as effects such as background focus blur.
The purchase comes as Samsung and other Android rivals step up their efforts to improve camera quality; the iPhone's camera has long been a selling point (both from a hardware and software standpoint). In 2013, Apple bought motion-sensing tech developer PrimeSense.

Looking to grab a bigger chunk of a burgeoning healthcare analytics market by offering more industry-specific solutions, IBM is buying Phytel, a provider of cloud-based patient data aggregation/analysis software, and Explorys, provider of a massive clinical database (said to consist of 315B datapoints) and a slew of analytics apps that run on top of them. Terms are undisclosed.
IBM declares Phytel will help it give healthcare providers "insights into patient health from data about patient behaviors and their engagement with care plans," and that Explorys will "accelerate the delivery of IBM Health Cloud and IBM Watson cognitive solutions to model and apply medical evidence and large scale analytics to data."
Both companies are being added to a new Watson Health unit based out of Boston. The business aims to provide software/services that can surface insights from large volumes of anonymous personal health data. As part of the effort, Big Blue is launching Watson Health Cloud, a platform that allows this data to be "anonymized, shared and combined with a dynamic and constantly-growing aggregated view of clinical, research and social health data."
IBM's partnership with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been expanded to cover Apple's HealthKit (health/fitness data) and ResearchKit (medical research) frameworks, via Watson and Health Cloud. The latter will provide a data storage/aggregation platform for iOS apps using HealthKit and ResearchKit. In addition, IBM will "build a suite of enterprise wellness apps using HealthKit."
Also: 1) IBM is partnering with Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) to create diabetes management solutions that pair Medtronic's devices (and the data they produce) with IBM's analytics and cognitive computing tools. 2) IBM is partnering with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) to "create intelligent coaching systems centered on preoperative and postoperative patient care, including joint replacement and spinal surgery."

"We continue to believe comps in FY16 will be quite difficult, while early reviews on Apple Watch suggest it will fall far short of the 'insanely great' benchmark, at least in this first iteration," writes Raymond James' Tavis McCourt, downgrading Apple (AAPL +0.1%) to Market Perform.
McCourt, who has a $124 target, is nonetheless upping his FY15/FY16 estimates. He notes "data points suggest iPhone demand remained strong y/y through March, especially in China, and is now starting to enter its normal seasonal slowdown in calendar 2Q."
Regarding Apple Watch, McCourt states a March survey of iPhone users found only 5% intending to buy one, down from nearly 10% in December. "[W]e are concerned that relatively muted reviews so far could place added fear in investors’ minds about the company’s ability to launch successful new product categories." His call comes two days after SocGen downgraded to Hold.
While McCourt downgrades, Canaccord's Mike Walkley has upped his target by $5 to $150, following positive survey data. "While our recent surveys indicated strong initial interest for the new Samsung Galaxy S6 smartphones could slow iPhone premium tier share gains during the June quarter, our March surveys indicated another strong quarter of market share gains for Apple." Cantor reported seeing strong March iPhone supplier sales on Tuesday.
Walkley forecasts "the iPhone 6 upgrade cycle will result in the installed iPhone base reaching 500M during C2015," and sees 20M 2015 Watch sales (4% of the iPhone base).
Meanwhile, following the start of Apple Watch pre-orders today, U.S. shipping times for most models have slipped to either "4-6 weeks" or "June." The official launch date for Watch sales is April 24.
It isn't clear to what extent the shipping push-outs stem from strong demand vs. limited supplies. Cowen and others have previously reported of Watch supply constraints.

Update: Piper's Gene Munster: "We believe that the current stable lead times suggests that supply was the main limiting factor in this morning’s sell out ... Given the quick sell-out, it seems less likely that Apple will be able to deliver 1 million units of stock on opening weekend, although we still believe there could be 1 million units of demand by April 24th sold via pre-order."

As Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) March 12 warning led many to expect, PC sales were weak in Q1: IDC estimates shipments fell 6.7% Y/Y to 68.5M, a much sharper drop than Q4's 2.4% and Q3/Q2's 1.7%. Gartner estimates shipments fell 5.2% to 71.7M. With IDC also reporting of price pressure, revenue declines might be larger.
IDC: [T]he Q1 market faced multiple headwinds – including inventory build-up of Windows Bing based notebooks, commercial slow down following the [Windows] XP refresh and constrained demand in many regions due to currency fluctuations and unfavorable economic indicators."  Gartner thinks sales of  "mobile PCs" (notebooks, convertibles, and Windows tablets) rose, while desktop sales fell sharply. "PC replacements will be driven by thin and light notebooks with tablet functionality."
Both Gartner and IDC report U.S. PC shipments fell only ~1% Y/Y. On the other hand, IDC thinks Japan (another high-ASP market) saw shipments fall 44%; strong Q1 2014 spending prior to a tax hike made for tough comps.
Market leaders Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) and HP (NYSE:HPQ) continued taking share from firms with less scale: IDC estimates Lenovo's share rose to 19.6% from 17.6% a year ago (3.4% unit growth), and HP's to 19% from 17.1% (3.3% unit growth).
#3 Dell's share rose to 13.5% from 13.4%; #4 Asus (OTC:ASUUY) was flat at 7.1%, and #5 Acer (OTC:ASIYF) rose to 7% from 6.3%. Everyone else collectively fell to 33.9% from 38.4%.
Unlike in Q4 and Q3 (seasonally stronger quarters for the company), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) wasn't in the global top-5. IDC estimates the company's US. unit share rose to 10.9% from 10.6%, good for fourth place (revenue share is higher).

|Apr. 8, 2015, 12:27 PM|Apple Watch reviews arrive; SocGen downgrades to Hold


Initial Apple Watch (AAPL - unchanged) reviews are positive, but not glowing. "You'll Want One, but You Don't Need One," reads Bloomberg's headline. The Verge gives it 7/10 stars; CNET gives it 3.5/5. "Gonna Be Juuuuuuust Nice Enough To Get Embargoed on Apple Watch 2 Next Year," quips Wired's Brian Barrett.
The Verge's Nilay Patel calls Apple Watch "the most capable smartwatch available today" after thoroughly going over a day of use. He likes the potential of its Taptic Engine, and enjoyed using Apple Pay. But he's also critical of its performance - "[T]he Apple Watch, as I reviewed it for the past week and a half, is kind of slow." - and thinks more options are needed to customize notifications and taptics.

Yahoo's David Pogue (formerly with the NYT) likes the Passbook, Remote, and Workout apps (among others), and the ability to quickly reply to texts with pre-typed responses and animated emojis. He thinks navigation and battery life remain weaknesses. "Nobody needs a smartwatch ... [T]he Apple Watch is, above all, a satisfying indulgence."
Bloomberg's Joshua Topolsky (formerly with The Verge) doesn't like the fact the clock isn't visible (to save battery life) when the Watch isn't engaged - "As a normal watch-wearer, the idea that I might look down at my wrist and not see the time was annoying." - and also thinks the Watch can be more distracting than an iPhone. He does call the hardware "beautiful in a surgical way," and admits "checking text messages and e-mails by quickly glancing at the watch saved me some time."

The WSJ's Joanna Stern suggests most consumers should wait for the next model.  "The body is bound to get thinner ... Soon, we won’t have to charge the  battery every night, the software won’t ever get stuttery and those  health sensors will get even more accurate."

Techpinions' Ben Bajarin provides one of the more upbeat takes. "The Apple Watch became my primary notification panel/dashboard ... In many ways the Apple Watch untethered me from my iPhone the way the iPhone untethered me from my PC ... Ultimately what I am convinced of is the Apple Watch represents a completely new computer interaction model."
Meanwhile, SocGen's Andy Perkins has downgraded Apple to Hold. He thinks a mix shift away from the iPhone 6/6+ and 128GB models will lead Apple's iPhone ASP to drop to $651 in calendar Q1 from Q4's $687, and is also concerned about forex and tough 2H15 comps.

 With five days to spare before the season premiere of hit Game of Thrones, HBO Now (NYSE:TWX) has opened for business on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices and Cablevision (NYSE:CVC). The Verge notes that overall, it's what you'd expected: HBO without the pay-TV subscription. HBO has included language in its agreement to change the number of streams/devices that subscribers can use, a sure hedge against password sharing. A nice benefit: For library content (which includes 2,000 titles), HBO will tell you the exact date when licensed films will be leaving the service so you can plan Other than that, it looks quite similar to HBO Go, its existing "TV Everywhere" approach for authenticated pay-TV subscribers. In her detailed recounting of the path to developing HBO Now, Nicole LaPorte notes the service might one day include content not available on the standard network offering.

Preliminary sales for Brian White's Apple Barometer (measures the sales of Apple-dependent Taiwanese suppliers) are up 42%-44% M/M in March, better than 2014's 34% Apple Barometer growth and well above the 28% average seen over the last 10 years.
The Cantor analyst/Apple uber-bull now sees Apple Barometer sales dropping 25%-27% Q/Q in seasonally weak Q1; that compares with 32% a year ago and 25% two years ago. By contrast, the midpoint of Apple's calendar Q1 (FQ2) sales guidance calls for a 28% Q/Q revenue drop, worse than last year's 21%.
White reiterates a $180 target ahead of Apple's (AAPL -0.1%) April 27 FQ2 report. That's equal to nearly 16x his 2016 EPS estimate after backing out $24.07/share in net cash. Strong Apple supplier sales could also be a positive for Cirrus Logic (CRUS -0.1%), which has risen over 80% from its fall lows with the help of strong iPhone-related sales.
Meanwhile, in an employee memo, Tim Cook states "more than one thousand [Apple Watch] apps were submitted in just four days last week when the App Store started accepting them, and the rate of submissions has only been climbing since then." Apple released its WatchKit SDK last November; 3rd-party Watch apps currently have to interact with complementary iPhone/iPad apps.
Cook also states Apple employees - there were 72,800 as of last year - will get a 50% Watch discount. Pre-orders start on April 10, and shipments/in-store sales on April 24.

Nine months after launching coverage with a Buy rating, Citi's Jim Suva has added Apple (AAPL -0.2%) to his Focus List, while reiterating a $145 target.
Among Suva's 5 reasons why he thinks Apple can continue rising: He expects consumer demand for higher-capacity iPhones (driven by increased app usage and higher-resolution photos) to provide a "permanent step up" for gross margins. Demand for 64GB/128GB iPhone 6/6+ models helped Apple's GM rise 200 bps Y/Y in FQ1 to 39.9%, and its iPhone ASP jump to $687 from FQ4's $603.
RBC argued yesterday GMs could benefit from component discounts, as well as yield, mix, and pricing improvements. "Going forward, we think that gross margins should act as the main lever for positive surprises..."
Also cited by Suva: 1) Faster consumer phone upgrades thanks to carrier promotions and upgrade plans. 2) Growing enterprise penetration as Apple steps up its efforts to court businesses. 3) The potential for Apple Pay/Passbook to strengthen the ecosystem through over a dozen potential uses (payments, identification, keyless entry, etc.). 4) An "attractive" valuation of 11x forward EPS exc. cash.
He sees Apple Watch as a "bonus" potential catalyst, and is cautious about its near-term sales due to concerns about its battery life and lack of built-in GPS (it relies on an iPhone to provide location data). Like others, Suva expects fresh dividend/buyback hikes to eventually arrive.

Earlier: Samsung gets rave reviews for Galaxy S6
|Apr. 1, 2015, 1:24 AM|Samsung gets rave reviews for Galaxy S6


"The iPhone 6 (NASDAQ:AAPL) Has Met Its Match," reads the headline for the WSJ's review of Samsung's (OTC:SSNLF) Galaxy S6.
Reviewer/iPhone 6 owner Joanna Stern: "Like a child who just found out that Santa isn’t real, I have spent the past week questioning everything I know." She's a fan of the S6's glass/metal body with dual Gorilla Glass 4 (NYSE:GLW) panes, as well as its 2K OLED display, improved fingerprint sensor, rapid charging support, and 16MP OIS-capable camera. "The Galaxy S6 destroys HTC’s new One M9 and other flagship Android phones ... on photo quality."

The Verge's Dieter Bohn gives the S6 8.8/10 stars. "Samsung finally copied the right thing: caring about design." Bohn declares the S6 to have "one of the finest screens I have ever seen on a phone," thanks to a 577 PPI pixel density and improved color awareness. He also calls the device (powered by an 8-core Exynos CPU) "probably the fastest Android phone I’ve ever used."

BGR's Zach Epstein: "Samsung’s Galaxy S6 features a stunning design that manages to be sleek and elegant, yet modern ... Samsung has raised the bar when it comes to smartphone screens ... Samsung finally stopped obsessing about increasing its [camera] megapixel counts and instead focused on improving its optics, design and software performance ... I’ve never used a phone that charged from empty to full as quickly as this one."
Samsung's software, though declared to be improved from the S5's (less bloatware, and what remains is often buried), still gets some criticism. Epstein reports seeing a lag with some UI features, and Stern is critical of Samsung's icons and keyboard. Also: Reviewers generally see little reason to pay an extra $100 for the curved S6 Edge, and some Android users might not like the S6's lack of a removable battery or microSD slot.
Ahead of the reviews, there have been reports Samsung has upped S6 production due to strong early interest. The phone goes on sale on April 10.
Other reviews: TechCrunch, CNET, Re/code, TechRadar

Expected S6 suppliers: BRCM, INVN, OLED, SYNA, MXIM, IDTI

"We believe ADI has secured multiple sockets across AAPL's iPhone/iPad lineup to enable the 3D/Force Touch feature," reports Barclays, upgrading Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) to Overweight and hiking its target by $15 to $70. "[W]e believe AAPL needs and would be be willing to pay for ADI's high accuracy [analog/digital] converters."

The WSJ reported 3 weeks ago Apple's next-gen iPhones will support haptic sensors that allow different software commands to be sent based on how hard a user presses on a screen. Apple has already integrated its haptics solution (christened Force Touch) within Apple Watch and a new 12" retina MacBook.
Barclays forecasts the Apple wins will boost ADI's 2016 EPS by $0.80 or more. It thinks 1 converter chip will be needed for the iPhone and 3 for a 12" iPad, and estimates an ASP of $1.50-$2.00. "ADI is known to have the best converters in the industry and this level of performance is needed to compensate for high levels of screen noise."
Long-term, the firm believes multi-chip iPad solutions could be replaced by a single chip, and that ADI could even "integrate the 2D touch function into a single super chip." It also believes the company is seeing strong industrial chip demand, forecasts a pickup in auto chip sales, and sees room for further revenue and cost synergies from the Hittite acquisition.
Shares have blasted off to new highs on Barclays' report.

Though there have been a slew of reports stating Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) will be the main supplier for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) A9 CPU (expected to go into the iPhone 6S/6S+ and next-gen iPad Air), "industry sources" tell Taiwan's Digitimes TSMC (NYSE:TSM) will "remain the major processor supplier for Apple in the second half of 2015."
The world's biggest foundry will reportedly supply CPUs for the iPhone 6S and 6S+ using a next-gen 16nm FinFET process, and for a cheaper 4" "6C model" via its existing 20nm process (used to make the A8). Cowen previously reported Apple is working on a new 4" iPhone.
The site qualifies its report by stating Samsung is also expected to be a 6S/6S+ supplier. Samsung recently began producing chips using its next-gen 14nm FinFET process, widely expected to be leveraged for A9 production. Meanwhile, A8 orders have done wonders for TSMC: The company has posted 30%+ Y/Y sales growth for several months in a row.
In spite of a favorable Digitimes report last night as well (that one was about Q2 sales), shares fell 5.4% today amid a major chip stock rout - volume (32.3M shares) more than doubled a 3-month daily average of 13M. Barron's has reported hearing CFO Lora Ho made cautious comments about near-term demand at a Hong Kong Credit Suisse conference.

Buyback-happy U.S. firms are prohibited from repurchasing shares from about five weeks prior to releasing quarterly earnings to about 48 hours after those reports. These blackout periods, says Goldman, may offer an especially tasty time for investors to pick up shares of their favorites.
"High valuations in the absence of corporate demand may weigh on stock prices," says Goldman's Amanda Sneider, and particular areas of focus are tech, consumer discretionary, and financials - they've accounted for more than 50% of buyback activity.

A Cowen survey of 3K smartphone owners - 1K apiece in the U.S. and China, and 500 apiece in the U.K. and Japan - found nearly 20% of the 1,500 respondents who owned an iPhone 6/6+ (NASDAQ:AAPL) stating "their new device replaced a competitor’s smartphone, of which ~83% were Android." Another 5% said the 6/6+ was their first smartphone.
Android defections were particularly strong in China, where 30% of 6/6+ owners said they replaced an Android phone - Apple's Greater China sales were up 70% Y/Y in calendar Q4. The figure was 14% in Japan, 9% in the U.K., and 8% in the U.S.
Also: 42% of the 1,500 respondents who plan to buy an iPhone 6/6+ in the next 12 months own a non-Apple smartphone, with 85% owning an Android device. Meanwhile, nearly 50% of those who have bought one upgraded early.
Regarding Apple Watch, the survey found 55% of respondents indicating "a positive purchase intention," and 28% indicating neutral purchase intent. With 3/4 of respondents expecting battery life to be above 1 day (as compared with the official 18 hours under normal use), Cowen sees battery life as a near-term limitation. The firm has also reported initially supplies could be low.

IDC assigned the iPhone a 19.7% Q4 unit share to Android's 76.6%; revenue share is likely above 40%. More than a few observers have argued the arrival of 4.7" and 5.5" iPhones could win over some Android users who prefer larger-screened devices.

The 3G-only Lumia 430 is Microsoft's (MSFT +1.4%) cheapest Windows Phone to date. It has a 4" 800x480 display and 8GB of storage, runs on Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM) low-end Snapdragon 200 processor (dual-core, 1.2GHz.), and contains a 2MP rear camera to go with a VGA front camera.
The 430, which goes on sale in April, also supports dual SIMs (important for emerging markets) and comes with up to 30GB of free OneDrive cloud storage. Its unveiling arrives three weeks after Microsoft launched the mid-range Lumia 640 and 640XL, and four months after it launched the low-end Lumia 535 (5" display and 3G-only, starts at €110).
Low-end devices are believed to account for a big portion of the 10.5M Lumias Microsoft sold in calendar Q4. While costlier Lumias have struggled to gain ground against the iPhone and high-end Android hardware (thanks in part to iOS/Android's app support edge), cheaper models have fared well in many cost-sensitive emerging markets. The 430 aims to significantly lower the cost edge the cheapest Android devices still have.
IDC estimates Windows Phone had a 2.8% global smartphone unit share in Q4 vs. 76.6% for Android (NASDAQ:GOOG) and 19.7% for the iPhone (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Four days after the WSJ reported Apple (AAPL +0.1%) plans to launch a Web TV service this fall, BuzzFeed's John Paczkowski (formerly with Re/code) reports the company plans to unveil a new Apple TV set-top at its June WWDC conference, replete with an App Store, developer SDK, and Siri support.
Paczkowski, who has a long history of providing Apple scoops, adds the new Apple TV is "a significant overhaul of the device, one intended to undergird Apple’s vision of what the TV viewing experience should be" and stand out from Roku, Amazon, etc. An A8 CPU (found in the iPhone 6/iPad Air 2) is said to be included, along with "a dramatic increase" in storage from the current 8GB and support for "a selection" of devices leveraging Apple's HomeKit home automation platform.
9to5 Mac reported two weeks ago Apple is "finishing up work on a slimmer Apple TV set-top-box with a more capable and tactile remote control and a redesigned operating system bundled with an App Store." Apple used its March 9 Watch event to announce a $30 price cut (to $69) for the current Apple TV, which was launched in 2012, and to state cumulative Apple TV sales have topped 25M.

 The TV service that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is talking about (per WSJ) would be anchored by major broadcasters ABC (NYSE:DIS), CBS and Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA) -- but leaving out NBC (NASDAQ:CMCSA) because of hard feelings might make Apple's plan a harder sell. WSJ's Shalini Ramachandran notes Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) launched Sling TV without Fox and NBC, and Sony (NYSE:SNE) Vue without Disney ... which might make this yet  another messy middle step toward some customers' a la carte dreams. The big broadcasters aren't all, though -- the talks with Disney could bring ESPN, and there may be other basic cable additions, though the ultimate package is likely to end up as a "skinny" bundle that leaves out the typically large number of channels in typical pay TV tiers. According to the report, the service would work across all iOS devices: iPhones, iPads, Apple TVs.

VentureBeat reports Intel's (INTC +3.7%) recently-announced XMM 7360 4G baseband modem (made by its Infineon unit) will go into 2016 iPhone units aimed at emerging markets in Asia and Latin America, thus partly taking a slot reserved for several years by Qualcomm's (QCOM -0.9%) Gobi modems.
The site adds Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) engineers "have been making trips to Munich, Germany to work with Intel engineers to ready the Intel LTE chip for the iPhone," and that Intel "has been willing to go a long way to get its LTE chips into Apple phones." Infineon was once the iPhone's (3G) baseband supplier, before Apple switched to Qualcomm.
The XMM 7360 supports Cat-10 LTE (450 Mbps peak download speeds), as well as 3x carrier aggregation. Qualcomm, which still claims the lion's share of the 4G baseband market, announced a Cat-10 LTE modem (the Gobi 9x45) last November that was declared to offer better power consumption and take up less board space than the prior-gen/Cat-6 9x35.
Apple sold 193M iPhones last year, and will likely top 200M this year. As is the case with many other clients, Qualcomm's modem sales to Apple help enable the sale of several complementary parts - an RF transceiver, a power management IC, a receive-only chip, and an envelope-tracking IC that lowers power draw.
Intel is up sharply today after selling off hard yesterday amid a market rout. The chip giant has already seen 18.2M shares traded vs.a 3-month daily average of 29M.

A day after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) showed off both a smartwatch and a 12" retina MacBook featuring haptic Force Touch sensors that let users send different software commands based on how hard they press, the WSJ reports Apple plans to add the technology to its next-gen iPhones.
The paper also states the next-gen iPhones will have 4.7" and 5.5" displays (no surprise), and that Apple is testing a pink color option to go with its current silver, gold, and space grey options.
Apple demoed several Force Touch-related features for Mac OS apps at yesterday's event; Mail, Safari, and the Finder app were among the covered products. Messages, Music, and Calendar are among the Apple Watch apps with Force Touch controls; 3rd-party developers can also write apps supporting the technology.
Immersion (NASDAQ:IMMR) has licensed its haptic software and patents to many Android phone OEMs, and could strike more Android deals if the WSJ's report pans out. During its Q4 CC (transcript), when asked whether it plans to reach a licensing deal with or sue Apple, Immersion simply stated its guidance doesn't assume any Apple revenue or litigation expenses.
Meanwhile, a slew of hands-on reactions have been provided for Apple Watch from writers given a chance to test the device at Apple's event. The consensus: The Watch has plenty of interesting features and apps - here's a run-down of 3rd-party apps - but compared with the iPhone/iPad, its UI can be confusing to a new user.
Bloomberg's Stephen Pulvirent: "On first use, the device felt a little confusing and clumsy. Sometimes it seemed to do one thing; at other times, just the opposite ... it seems like the interplay between tapping, swiping, and turning the crown will take some getting used to."
The NYT's Farhad Manjoo: "Whether it’s calling an Uber car, checking into your hotel or answering a text, the watch will allow you to interact with the digital world at a glance, in a less outwardly antisocial way than you now do with your phone ... Should you really spend hundreds of dollars, let alone thousands, on a gadget to free you from the inconvenience of accessing your $650 smartphone? That remains the deepest unanswered question about the Apple Watch."

 Making the rounds after Apple's Watch event, HBO (TWX +1.3%) CEO Richard Plepler says he talked to Apple's (AAPL +0.4%) senior VP Eddy Cue last spring about a "shared vision" for the TV service -- though HBO's programming partners are scrambling a bit to sort out a response this month. On the thorny issue of HBO's cable/satellite partners who may object: "We are talking to all of our partners," Plepler says, adding HBO thought "it would be a great vehicle for them." While Apple has a three-month exclusive for its devices, program providers could get into that window via their existing relationship with HBO. Cablevision (NYSE:CVC) and Cox Communications were known to be in discussions with HBO already about providing the service. Cox is mum so far on how/if it will make HBO Now available to broadband-only customers. Apple makes a pretty good partner for a content company that has no experience with direct customer service; meanwhile, Apple has a massive payments infrastructure and 400M credit cards already set up. NPD analyst John Buffone tells Tom's Guide that Apple TV is No. 1 in their last streaming device report, ahead of Roku, Chromecast and Fire TV. It's used by 25M. No exclusive window comes without money changing hands; while financial terms are undisclosed, it's possible there's a middle ground between the 30% cut that Apple takes in apps and the 50-50 split HBO has with some existing program partners. HBO thinks the addressable market is 10M broadband-only subscribers, meaning a landscape of $150M/month to split more or less evenly. Related programmers: CMCSA, TWC, T

Early reactions to the 12" retina MacBook - it will be known just as a MacBook, with no Air suffix attached - have been positive. Apple Watch reactions have been more mixed - the feature set is liked more than the pricing.

It's 13.1mm thin, and weighs just 2 pounds. For reference, the current 11" and 13" MacBook Airs respectively weigh 2.38 and 2.96 pounds.
The 12" MacBook has an all-metal enclosure, a new keyboard that's thinner and provides more precise/accurate keystrokes, and a clickless "Force Touch" trackpad with haptic force sensors (enables pressure-sensitive "Force Clicks"). Engadget wonders if Synaptics' (SYNA) ForcePad tech is being used. Immersion (IMMR +5%) has spiked higher, perhaps on hopes Apple rivals will adopt its haptic tech.
Some specs: A 2304x1440 display that consumes 30% less power than prior displays; a 14nm Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Core M CPU (cores clocked up to 1.3GHz., rising to 2.9GHz. with Turbo Boost); 9 hours of battery life for wireless Web browsing; a single USB-C (reversible) connector that can serve as a data, power, or video-out (HDMI/VGA) connector.
The 12" MacBook begins shipping on April 10, and will be offered via $1299  and $1599 models; the costlier model has a faster CPU and twice the  storage.
Also: 1) Apple has updated the 13" MacBook Pro, providing it with faster CPUs, and flash memory, improved battery life, and the Force Touch trackpad. The MacBook Air line has also received CPU and flash upgrades. 2) Apple has unveiled ResearchKit, an open-source software framework for medical researchers that enables diagnostics iPhone apps.

Tim Cook states at Apple's (AAPL +1%) San Francisco event the price of the current Apple TV set-top (now 3 years old) has been cut by $30 to $69. That makes it more competitive with Roku's hardware ($50-$100) and Google's Chromecast ($35, requires another device to stream content). A new Apple TV set-top is rumored to be in the pipeline.
HBO (TWX +0.8%) CEO Richard Plepler announces Apple will be the exclusive launch partner for the standalone HBO Now streaming service (previous). He also confirms the service will be priced at $15/month.
Some shared stats: 700M iPhones and 25M Apple TVs have been cumulatively sold, and Apple Pay is now supported at 700K locations; 100K Coca-Cola vending machines will support it by year's end. All major auto manufacturers now support CarPlay.

|Mar. 6, 2015, 6:48 AM|Where could HBO Now go? (And where does it leave HBO Go now?)

 While HBO (NYSE:TWX) is in high-profile talks with Apple to launch its streaming HBO Now service on Apple TV, other providers will be joining in at some point or even at launch day yet, including Google and TiVo (NASDAQ:TIVO) among others. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may be first to agree to the launch, Bloomberg notes, because its negotiation is simpler than that with HBO's longtime pay TV partners. Cox Communications and Cablevision (NYSE:CVC) are also linked to discussions, though traditional cable/satellite providers are a tougher sell, accustomed as they are to the traditional arrangement (and income stream). It's safe to assume all the partners marketing HBO's current HBO Go offering are likely to engage in some level of talks with TWX to offer HBO Now -- including Roku, Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox, Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation, and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Cable repercussions? Several pay TV operators had started lowering their price for HBO via promotions, a possible move to brace for HBO Now's direct launch: Comcast lowered its monthly HBO rate from $18.95 to $15, or $10 if you order online. Verizon's offering HBO for $9.99/month for first 12; Time Warner Cable is offering $9.99/month for online orders; Cox is offering $10/month for the first six. As for HBO Go -- the current service that allows mobile viewing for authenticated existing HBO customers -- it appears it will continue to exist as is for now, despite the likelihood of product confusion. HBO's targeting 10M broadband subscribers who don't have cable or satellite -- at this $15 price point, it makes a huge competitive interface with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). |Mar. 5, 2015, 5:40 PM|Report: Apple music service to undercut Spotify, new Apple TV planned



9to5 Mac reports Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) plans to launch a music subscription service relying on technology provided by Beats Music at its WWDC conference (expected to run from June 8-12). It adds the service will be "priced as high as $7.99 per month," thereby undercutting the existing Beats Music service ($10/month or $100/year), as well as Spotify ($10/month + $5 per extra family member) and other existing services.
The service will be built into the iOS Music app, and will also be offered through a standalone Android app (the first to be built by Apple internally). Re/code has already reported Apple is trying to get studios to agree to a price cut. The WSJ reported in October Apple plans to merge the Beats Music service with iTunes.
The rumored launch effort comes as standard music download sales continue declining. Tim Cook praised Beats Music (relies on both an algorithm and human curation) last May. "We love the subscription service that they built—we think it's the first one that really got it right."
9to5 also reports Apple is "finishing up work on a slimmer Apple TV set-top-box with a more capable and tactile remote control and a redesigned operating system bundled with an App Store." Though Apple once wanted to launch the box as soon as this month - the current-gen Apple TV is three years old - challenges in nailing down content deals "could keep the new Apple TV from debuting until another point in the future."
Bloomberg reported last year Apple was working on deals to support pay-TV content from Time Warner Cable and others through a new Apple TV. More recently, Re/code reported Apple is hatching plans to offer a Web TV service.

Update:  Re/code has followed up by reporting Apple is talking with studios about deals allowing it to distribute new music from "high-profile artists" before it arrives on other services.

Bloomberg reports production of a 12.9" iPad (NASDAQ:AAPL) is "now scheduled to start around September because of delays involving the supply of display panels." Sources state Apple previously planned to start production in calendar Q1.
The larger iPad is expected to be aimed at enterprises and creative pros - there have been rumors of a stylus accessory for it - and bolster a business sales push that already includes partnerships with IBM and various indie developers to create enterprise-focused iOS apps. On Monday, IBM launched new iOS apps aimed at banking/financial services, retail, and travel/transportation clients.
While iPhone and Mac sales have been growing, the iPad has been a weak spot for Apple lately: iPad sales have been down Y/Y during the last four quarters, and fell 22% in FQ1 (the December quarter).

Update: The WSJ backs up Bloomberg's report, stating production will begin in 2H15. It also reports Apple is thinking of including USB 3.0 ports on the 12.9" iPad.
|Mar. 4, 2015, 3:43 PM|HBO said to work with Apple as launch partner for standalone offering

 HBO (NYSE:TWX) is reportedly talking with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a launch partner for its streaming service -- to be called "HBO Now" and rolling out next month. The service is working with MLB Advanced Media to produce the standalone service in time for the fifth season premiere of Game of Thrones. The price is expected to be about $15/month. For Apple's part, it would mean a chance to add a high-quality offering to push adoption of Apple TV. The availability of a standalone service from HBO -- often a $15-$20/month add-on and a marquee offering in cable/satellite packages -- should send ripples throughout the pay TV industry. One study says the service alone would cause a 7% drop in subscribers overall. Some providers -- who count on Internet customers as well -- may bundle it with broadband offerings in order to reach cord-cutters, however.

 As part of a growing move into digital services, mega-telecom Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) says that it plans a voice-command search engine to compete with Google Now (NASDAQ:GOOG), Apple's Siri (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft's Cortana (NASDAQ:MSFT). The offering, detailed by the company's Ana Segurado in an interview at Mobile World Congress, was developed by Spanish firm Sherpa working with Telefonica on an "alternative to traditional search" for smartphones. Sherpa has a search app on Google Play. Segurado is managing director of Telefonica's Open Future unit, working on startup support and venture capital investments.

As rumored, Samsung's (OTC:SSNLF) Galaxy S6 eschews the plastic-heavy designs of its predecessors in favor a body with a metal frame and both front and back glass panels - both panels use Corning's (NYSE:GLW) recently-launched Gorilla Glass 4 (offers better damage resistance).
Also as expected: The standard S6 is accompanied by the S6 Edge, a premium model with curved sides. Samsung has also launched a new version of its Gear VR headset (relies on Oculus' VR platform) that uses the S6/S6 Edge for its display instead of the Note 4.
The S6's display size is unchanged from the S5's 5.1", but (as was the case for the Note 4) the resolution has been upgraded from 1080p to 2560x1440 - that's a positive for OLED materials supplier Universal Display (NASDAQ:OLED). An 8-core Samsung Exynos processor powers international S6 models - Qualcomm Snapdragon processors have historically powered U.S. models, but that might not be the case this time.
A new fingerprint sensor (previous) only requires users to touch the home button (a la Apple's TouchID) rather than swipe over it, as is the case with the S5's sensor. Synaptics (NASDAQ:SYNA) should receive an ASP boost, provided it remains Samsung's fingerprint sensor supplier and not rival FPC.
Other features: Wireless charging support; a 16MP rear camera with optical image stabilization, improved software, and an F/1.9 aperture (good for low-light shots); a 5MP front camera that also has an F/1.9 aperture, 32/64/128GB storage tiers (up from 16/32/64GB); and far less bloatware - Samsung claims the S6 has 40% fewer software features than the S5.
Initial reactions are positive. "Samsung finally builds a premium smartphone," proclaims Ars Technica. The Verge calls the S6/S6 Edge "dramatically nicer and better phones than Samsung has ever produced." More than a few observers have spotted major design similarities with the iPhone 6 (NASDAQ:AAPL).
The phones go on sale on April 10. Samsung needs a hit: It's coming off a Q4 where its smartphone unit share fell to 20% from 28.8% a year earlier (per IDC) amid stiff competition from Apple and Chinese Android OEMs.

As of 2012, Cisco (CSCO -0.9%) had 60 products on a Chinese government list of products approved for purchase by state entities. As of late 2014, it had none, according to Reuters' analysis of government data.
PC/server virtualization software vendor Citrix (CTXS +0.5%) has also seen its products disappear from the list, as have Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) McAfee security software unit. While the total number of products on the list has risen by over 2K since 2012 (to nearly 5K), the number of approved foreign tech brands has fallen by a third.
The data highlights the ripple effects of the 2013 NSA spying uproar, as well as China's broader interest in promoting local tech firms relative to foreign suppliers. Bloomberg reported in December the Chinese government is "aiming to purge most foreign technology from banks, the military, state-owned enterprises and key government agencies by 2020."
Cisco's Chinese sales have already been under heavy pressure for several quarters. Thanks in part to the government's efforts, the networking giant's Chinese orders fell 19% Y/Y in the January quarter, compared with just a 1% drop for other Asia-Pac markets.
Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY), ZTE (OTCPK:ZTCOY), and Huawei are among the local firms likely to benefit from the government's attempts to buy local.

"Look for the stock price to rise to $160 over the next year for a 25% return including dividends," writes Barron's Jack Hough in a weekend column. "Expect a big dividend hike when the company updates its capital-return program, likely in April. The current yield looks undersized at 1.5%."
Hough notes Apple (AAPL +2%), unlike most tech peers, reports EPS on a GAAP basis, which (by including stock compensation and other expenses) serves to deflate the figure. He also highlights Apple's negative cash-conversion cycle - it's paid by customer for products before it pays suppliers - which is a big reason why its FY15 free cash flow/share consensus ($10.17) is well above its EPS consensus ($8.53).
At $160, Apple would trade at 17x forward EPS, on par with the S&P 500's current valuation. Hough: "Considering Apple’s understated earnings, its cash hoard, its avenues for growth, and its history of beating expectations, it’s time for the stock to carry at least a market valuation, if not a premium."
Meanwhile, Mizuho's Abhey Lamba, who downgraded on Jan. 15 (ahead of earnings), remains cautious. "From 75 million units we saw in the December quarter, we think [iPhone sales are] going to decelerate more meaningfully into the March quarter. We think the Apple Watch is not big engouh to offset the gap the phone is going to leave."

Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) has acquired mobile wallet startup LoopPay, indicating its intention to launch a smartphone payments service to compete with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay and others.
Despite strong backing, mobile payments have been slow to catch on, as many retailers have been reluctant to adopt the infrastructure required for the mobile payment options to work.

The WSJ reports Apple (AAPL +0.3%) has ordered 5M-6M Apple Watch units for Q1 production ahead of the device's April launch. Half of the orders are for the cheaper Sport model, and 1/3 are expected to be for the standard Apple Watch. Notably, Apple plans for production of the high-end Apple Watch Edition (18-karat gold case) to top 1M units/month in Q2. The paper also reports Apple axed plans to have the Watch support blood pressure, heart activity (EKG), and stress level monitoring, among other health-related features, due to a mixture of reliability, complexity, and regulatory issues. They might find their way into future models. Not surprisingly, speculation is swirling about Apple's electric car ambitions. Adding to the frenzy: A minivan linked to Apple and sporting rooftop cameras has been spotted around Silicon Valley. It's not clear if the vehicles are part of an EV project or, say, a mapping project.
While the WSJ has reported Apple isn't looking to create a self-driving car, Reuters has reported the company is "studying the potential for automated driving." It adds Apple is "gathering advice on parts and production methods, focusing on electric and connected-car technologies," and confirms the company is "exploring how to make an entire vehicle."
Former Apple exec Jean-Louis Gasse is skeptical Apple will sell a full-blown car. "Ford, the healthiest US car company, made $835M in net income last quarter, less than 4% of their $34B in sales ... There isn’t an inkling of an explanation for why and how a superior product designed and built by Apple would bring superior returns ... Furthermore, there is no Moore’s Law for cars."

Four months after setting a $203 Apple (AAPL +2.1%) target in an open letter, Carl Icahn has upped his target to a lofty $216 in a new letter.
Icahn's target is based on a multiple of 20x an FY15 (ends Sep. '15) EPS estimate of $9.70 - up from a prior $9.60 and well above an $8.57 consensus - and $22/share in cash.
Notably, Icahn's EPS estimate is based on a 20% "real cash earnings" tax rate, rather than the 26.2% "effective" tax rate used by Apple, which recognizes taxes on unremitted foreign earnings. He declares his estimate is only $0.39 above consensus if the tax rate difference is accounted for.
As one would expect, the activist investor uses his aggressive target to renew his call for larger buybacks. "[W]e continue to hope that Tim Cook and Apple’s Board of Directors, on behalf of all shareholders, take advantage of this dramatic market value anomaly and increase the magnitude and rate of share repurchases while this remarkable opportunity still exists."
Apple, whose shares were already rallying before Icahn's letter was published (perhaps aided by Tim Cook's Goldman conference talk), has made new highs and is closing in on $125.

Cook also states the Apple Pay rollout is "going faster than I thought it would, much faster." Apple has provided few details thus far about total Apple Pay transaction volumes.
He asserts once more Apple Watch (set to ship in April) will be a game-changing product, as debate continues to swirl about the size of its market opportunity. "The customizable nature of the Apple Watch is incredible."
Apple closed up 1.9%, making new highs and becoming the first U.S. company to post a $700B+ market cap along the way. First Solar closed up 4.8%, spiking in the final minutes of trading thanks to Cook's disclosure.

"We have developed a new product that will provide sapphire-like scratch resistance while maintaining the legendary toughness and break resistance of Gorilla Glass," Corning (NYSE:GLW) exec James Clappin stated at yesterday's investor meeting. Corning plans to start selling the composite, known for now as Project Phire, later this year.
Though Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stuck with Gorilla Glass for the iPhone 6 and would-be Apple sapphire supplier GT Advanced (OTCPK:GTATQ) filed for bankruptcy - it's now trying to sell ~2K sapphire furnaces to pay off creditors, with stockholders getting anything left over - there's still strong industry interest in sapphire as a potential smartphone cover glass solution due to its scratch-resistance and thinness; Apple has said it will "continue evaluating" GT's sapphire progress.
Meanwhile, Apple Watch and other smartwatches have adopted sapphire cover glass, and sapphire wafer/materials provider Rubicon (NASDAQ:RBCN) recently announced it's working on "scratch-resistant sapphire-coated faceplates for smartphones and larger devices," as part of a broader effort to expand into new markets. Concerns about the material's cost and brittleness remain.

Also disclosed by Corning: 1) The Display Technologies (LCD glass) segment is expected to see 2015 earnings growth comparable with 2014 levels. 2) Corning's glass sales related to large-size LCD TVs rose over 50% in 2014 on a unit basis; it forecasts 30%+ growth in large-size LCD viewing area by 2016. 3) The Optical Communications (fiber) business is expected to see high-single digit 2015 growth, aided by strong sales to the last-mile fiber, data center, and distributed antenna markets.

Re/code: "The theory is that Apple would put together bundles of programming — but not the entire TV lineup that pay TV providers generally offer — and sell it directly to consumers, over the Web." Naturally, Apple would develop its own UI and control the user experience.
Though Apple has shown programmers demos of its planned service, Re/code cautions "talks seem to be in the early stages, which means terms like pricing and timing aren’t close to being ironed out."
Past remarks from Apple execs have suggested both a strong dislike of the current TV-viewing experience, and an interest in improving it if the industry is willing to play ball.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has filed to sell $5B worth of floating rate and fixed-rate notes. The floating-rate notes are due 2020, and the fixed-rate notes due 2020, 2022, 2025, and 2045. (prospectus)
Pricing hasn't been set yet. Goldman and Deutsche are underwriting. Given Apple's huge cash balance, and its history with such offerings, buybacks are a likely use of the proceeds.
Apple's cash/marketable securities balance totaled $178B at the end of FQ1 (much of it offshore), and its debt balance stood at $36.4B. The company spent $5B on buybacks during the quarter, and has spent $73B on them over the history of its $130B capital return program.

AAPL +0.7% premarket.

Update: Apple upsized the offering to $6.5B. Interest rates were predictably low, with the 2045 notes carrying just a 3.45% coupon.

Himax (HIMX +6.7%), QuickLogic (QUIK +7.4%), and Pixelworks (PXLW +5.4%) are posting big gains on a day that has seen many mobile chipmakers rally in the wake of Apple's strong FQ1 iPhone sales print.
Himax's LCD driver ICs and QuickLogic's sensor hubs go into Android devices rather than Apple's mobile hardware. Pixelworks counts Apple as a client, but details about the business relationship are limited. Many think an SoC being developed by Pixelworks for large-screen applications (through a "co-development partnership") is meant for Apple.
Possibly helping Pixelworks' cause: Tim Cook stated on Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) CC (transcript) 25M Apple TV units have now been cumulatively shipped, up from 20M last April, and that the product is one which Apple "[continues] to look at and work on and find a way that we can make even greater contribution than what we’re doing."

 Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has seen at least ten target hikes after soundly beating FQ1 estimates on the back of a big iPhone sales print. Shares are less than $2.50 away from a high of $119.75. 
UBS' Steve Milunovich: "The 74.5mn unit iPhone figure deserves all the adjectives analysts can muster, especially given that (1) supply/demand balance was not achieved until Jan, and (2) 49% sell-thru growth bettered the sell-in increase of 46% ... our guess that iPhone 6+ was 30% of total iPhone units likely was near the mark." He sees an 18% iPad unit decline and "flattish" iTunes revenue as the only negatives. BTIG' Walter Piecyk: "The strongest criticism you may hear today is that Apple created too difficult a comp for the December 2015 quarter based on an unsupported assumption that ‘everyone upgraded their phone in 2014.’ We believe that assumption is wrong." 
Citi believes new smartphone upgrade/installment plan options from carriers are providing a lift, as is interest in 64GB models. It adds shares are still only trading at 13x forward EPS (10.4x exc. cash). On SA, Orange Peel Investments sees room for shares to run to $150 (18x forward earnings), aided by smartphone and PC share gains and China growth.

CFO Luca Maestri notes forex headwinds had a 4% impact on revenue growth (plenty of other tech giants can relate), with the yen and ruble the biggest culprits. He suggests the impact going forward will be around 5%; more favorable component costs will partly offset.
Maestri adds iPhone channel inventory fell by 200K Q/Q, and that supply only met up with demand in January. iPad inventory rose by 1M.
Other details: 1) iPhone sales more than doubled Y/Y in mainland China and Brazil. 2) App Store revenue rose 41% Y/Y. iTunes/media revenue rose by $200M to $2.6B. 3) Apple now has 447 retail stores (182 outside the U.S.).

In the proxy materials for its 2015 annual meeting (set for March 10), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) discloses Tim Cook's 2014 compensation totaled $9.22M, up from 2013's $4.25M. Cook's package included a $1.75M salary and $6.7M in non-equity incentive compensation.
Also disclosed: J. Crew CEO Mickey Drexler, a board member since 1999, is retiring following the annual meeting. The board, which has seven other members, hasn't yet nominated a replacement.

9to5 Mac reports Apple is targeting 2.5 hours of Apple Watch battery life under "heavy" application use (such as CPU-intensive gameplay), 3.5 hours under standard app use, and close to 4 hours when its fitness tracking software is engaged. In standby or low-power modes, 2-3 days of battery life is reportedly likely. Tim Cook has previously suggested Watch users will end up charging the device daily.
Though the carrier didn't break out iPhone sales, some Apple bulls are taking heart in Verizon's Q4 numbers. Verizon saw a 34% Y/Y increase in postpaid device activations to 15.3M, and a 38% increase in postpaid smartphone sales.
A Q4 CIRP survey indicates the "weighted average no-contract retail price" for U.S. iPhone sales rose 13% Q/Q and 9% Y/Y, reports UBS. The firm forecasts 67M FQ1 iPhone sales at a high ASP of $685. Meanwhile, mobile ad firm AppLovin reports seeing a 60:40 split between the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in China.

With the Nasdaq off 1.2% and Mizuho's Abhey Lamba having downgraded to Neutral, Apple (AAPL -2.5%) is posting a sizable decline. 42.5M shares have been traded thus far vs. a 3-month daily average of 51M.
Following Asian supply chain checks, Lamba thinks Apple could report 70M+ FQ1 iPhone sales on Jan. 27, with "a healthy mix of iPhone 6 Plus." He also expects "management to report significant backlog and inventory below normal levels."
However, he believes there's "limited upside" to an FQ2 iPhone consensus of ~50M, and more broadly expects slowing iPhone sales momentum going forward due to growing penetration rates and "likely saturation of smartphones at the upper end of the market."
Meanwhile, Pac Crest's Andy Hargreaves, who downgraded following the September iPhone 6/Watch launch event, is out with another cautious note (previous), stating the FQ2 consensus is "at the high end of what Apple is likely to guide to." He sees "particular risk around Apple Watch unit volume, iPad unit volume and sales and marketing expenses."
Rosenblatt's Brian Blair is more bullish: He forecasts 72M FQ1 iPhone sales, and reports a supply/demand imbalance still existed in nearly all of the iPhone 6's 110+ markets at the end of December. Blair expects calendar 2015 iPhone sales to rise 16% to 220M. On Tuesday, Canaccord reported seeing tight supplies for some iPhone 6 models at U.S. carrier stores.

Apple (AAPL -0.9%) has sued Ericsson (ERIC +0.2%) over 4G patents the mobile infrastructure giant is trying to collect royalties on, arguing Ericsson's royalty demands are excessive and that the patents aren't standards-essential. Apple also claims Ericsson wants a royalty based on the entire sales price of a 4G phone or tablet, and that it should only be based on the price of the device's baseband processor.
In 2008, Apple and Ericsson struck a licensing deal covering many of the patents now under dispute. A WSJ source says that agreement will expire shortly.
Ericsson has responded to Apple's suit filing a complaint against the company with a U.S. district court, stating Apple's existing license had expired and that two years of negotiations have failed. Ericsson wants the court's help to determine if its offer is fair.
Last year, Samsung agreed to pay Ericsson $650M to settle a long-running patent dispute, as well as pay royalties on future hardware sales. More recently, Ericsson scored an Indian injunction against Xiaomi. Lawsuits against several Indian OEMs remain outstanding.
Ericsson's 2013 IP licensing revenue, which included a lump-sum payment from Apple, totaled $1.3B. Q4 results arrive on Jan. 27.
|Jan. 14, 2015, 10:41 AM|GoPro bounces as analysts dismiss Apple patent



JMP's Alex Gauna: "We have reviewed U.S. Patent 8934045 in its entirety, and reached the conclusion that it represents minimal, if any, change to the GoPro (GPRO +2.7%) risk profile, as to us it hints more at a smartphone and smartwatch use case, and the mention of waterproofing and mounts are contextual rather than central to the application."
Gauna doubts Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will compete head-on against GoPro, and states CES featured "a good number of GoPro imitators but none that were able to match the brand energy, performance, use cases, and/or software and social networking value proposition of the Hero lineup."
Wedbush's Michael Pachter: "I don’t think these patents imply that they’ll issue a standalone device. Rather, they’re going to figure out a way to bolt a phone to your head or put it at the end of the stick and the patents are for the remote control and how it works for the camera."

AppleInsider observes Apple's patent was effectively acquired from Kodak in 2012. "A side-by-side comparison of the application as assigned to Kodak and the patent as granted to Apple shows only minor changes."
Shares are still down 10% from Monday's close.

|Jan. 13, 2015, 12:05 PM|GoPro down 6% after Apple camera patent published


Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been granted a patent (application filed in 2012) for a sports camera system that can be controlled using a phone or watch.
The camera can be mounted on/secured to various devices, such as a bike helmet, motorcycle handlebar, or surfboard. It would also feature a "mounted mode" that adjusts for vibrations.
Volatile GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) has sold off hard following the patent's publication. Dougherty, however, suggests taking the news in stride. "For starters, we note that Apple patents many, many inventions and some small percentage tend to see the light of day as an actual product. More than anything, we see a scenario in which Apple will want to have a way for users to record from their iPhones and iPads remotely using the Apple Watch as a remote."
GoPro's mobile apps support remote camera control. The company's product line also includes its $80 Wi-Fi-based Smart Remote.

|Jan. 13, 2015, 9:46 AM|Apple up 2.4% following Credit Suisse upgrade


Credit Suisse's Kulbinder Garcha has upgraded Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Outperform two weeks before its FQ1 report, and hiked his target by $20 to $130. "We raise our earnings per share estimates by 18 percent/20 percent to $9.44/$10.06, given a solid and sustainable iPhone volume base, sizable increase in scope for cash return and earnings per share momentum." The FY15 and FY16 EPS consensus estimates are only at $7.77 and $8.56.

Garcha forecasts 215M FY15 iPhone sales, and a similar amount for FY16. The FY15 forecast assumes the acquisition of 76M users for rival platforms, and a pickup the global iPhone replacement rate to 21 months. A 31.8% FY15 increase in purchase obligation guidance is seen as an indicator of strong demand. Like others, he thinks a mix shift towards the iPhone 6 Plus and 64GB models will provide a margin boost.
Notable, Garcha also expects Apple to "announce a sizable increase in its cash return program for the next 3 years through the end of 2017 to over $200bn" - $165B for buybacks, $37B for dividends. He forecasts 20M 2015 Apple Watch sales at a $400 ASP and 50% gross margin.
Separately, Digitimes reports Quanta has begun volume production of a new 12" MacBook Air, paving the way for a Q1 launch. 9to5 Mac reported on the product last week.

|Jan. 12, 2015, 5:58 PM|PC sales better than expected; Apple's share tops 7%



IDC estimates global PC shipments fell 2.4% Y/Y in Q4 to 80.8M - a bigger decline than Q3 and Q2's 1.7%, but better than expectations for a 4.8% drop. Gartner is more positive, estimating shipments rose 1% to 83.7M.
Both firms observe emerging markets, where tablet cannibalization remains a major issue, remain in worse shape than developed markets. IDC also states commercial PC demand (boosted earlier this year by MSFT's ending of Win. XP support) has slowed, and that "market progress has been fueled by low-priced systems, including growth of Chromebooks and [Microsoft's] promotion of Windows 8 + Bing."
On the bright side, both IDC and Gartner report Asia-Pac returned to positive growth, and that broader consumer demand is gradually improving. The U.S. consumer market is expected to return to positive growth in 2015, aided by slowing tablet demand and the Windows 10 launch.
IDC believes all top-5 vendors gained share from rivals with less scale. A quarter after cracking the top-5 for the first time with a 6.3% share, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) unit share is believed to have risen to 7.1% (+130 bps Y/Y) on the back of 4.9M shipments (+18.9%). Given higher ASPs, revenue share might be around 15%.
Market leader Lenovo's (OTCPK:LNVGY) share rose 140 bps to 19.9%; #2 HP's (NYSE:HPQ) rose 300 bps to 19.7%; #3 Dell's rose 140 bps to 13.5%; #4 Acer's (OTC:ASIYF) rose 40 bps to 7.7%. Non-top 5 firms saw their share drop 740 bps to 32.2%, with their shipments declining 20.7%.

App Store billings rose 50% Y/Y in 2014 and developer payouts topped $10B, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) discloses. With the company getting a 30% cut, the figure implies total App Store revenue was near $15B, and Apple's take north of $4.5B. Cumulative developer payouts have topped $25B.
Apple adds nearly $500M was spent through the App Store during the first week of January, and that a new single-day revenue record was set on New Year's.
With the help of favorable demographics - on average, iOS users are wealthier than Android users - and Apple's requesting of a credit card number when setting up an iTunes account, iOS has long maintained an outsized mobile app revenue share.
App Annie estimates Google Play downloads were 60% above App Store downloads in Q3. However, App Store revenue was nonetheless 60% higher. This gap is a key reason (though not the only one) why a large percentage of developers still write for iOS first.
After selling off in recent weeks, Apple has risen sharply on a day the Nasdaq is up 1.7%.

The complaint asserts that Beats ended its relationship with Monster through a change-of-ownership clause after conducting a "sham transaction" with HTC.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is "finishing up work on the Apple Watch’s software, and sources familiar with the product’s development say that the device is currently on track to ship in the United States by the end of March," reports 9to5 Mac, which has a good track record with Apple product scoops.
The site previously reported retail chief Angela Ahrendts had told employees the Watch would arrive sometime in spring, after the Chinese New Year. Officially, Apple has only said the device will launch in "early 2015."
9to5 adds Apple "has been polishing up the Watch OS and putting the device’s battery through more extensive testing," and has also been "working overtime to improve the inductive charging mechanism necessary for charging up the device each night." Tim Cook during an October talk: "We think you’re going to end up charging [Apple Watch] daily. Overnight, that’s what we think."
Also: Apple is reported to be working on a 12" MacBook Air sporting "a radically new design that jettisons standards such as full-sized USB ports, MagSafe connectors, and SD card slots in favor of a markedly thinner and lighter body with a higher-resolution display."
The notebook is said to have "the fewest amount of ports ever on an Apple computer," and (in order to reduce thickness) a touchpad with no physical feedback. A rendition seen by 9to5 shows only a headphone jack and microphone inputs on the left side, and a sole USB Type-C port on the right.
Rumors about a 12" retina MacBook Air have swirled for some time. Most recently, they've suggested the device will ship in mid-2015 (perhaps after launching at WWDC).

Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) FQ1 report will arrive after the close on Tuesday, Jan. 27. As usual, the CC will be held at 5PM ET.
Consensus is for revenue of $66.42B (+15.3% Y/Y), and EPS of $2.54 (+23%). Last month, Morgan Stanley pegged the iPhone sales consensus at 63M; FQ1 iPhone sales totaled 51M a year ago.
|Jan. 3, 2015, 10:22 AM|Poll: Only 5.4% of U.S. iPhone owners "very likely" to buy Apple Watch


A Quartz poll of 811 U.S. smartphone owners found only 2.2% and 3.2% of iPhone owners respectively stating they're "extremely likely" or "very likely" to buy an Apple Watch (AAPL), and 14.3% saying they're "somewhat likely" to do so. 18.9% said they're "not so likely" to buy one, and 61.4% said they're "not at all likely" to buy.
With Apple having disclosed Watch pricing will start at $349 - the stainless steel version has been rumored to start at $500 - cost was cited as the most common reason for a lack of interest. 60.1% of those who said they'd be willing to pay for one put their maximum purchase price at "less than $200." 25.7% would be willing to pay $200-$299, and 8.6% $300-$399. Roughly half of survey respondents regularly wear a watch.
Traditional attitudes towards watch spending - will smartwatches change them? - appear to have strongly influenced the poll's results. Only 17.2% of regular watch-wearers owned a watch from a luxury brand such as Rolex or Omega. 49.2% owned one from an "everyday brand" such as Timex or Casio, and 44.1% owned one from a premium brand such as Seiko or Movado.
The Quartz poll coincides with cautious remarks from prominent VC Fred Wilson about Apple Watch's 2015 performance. "Apple Watch will not be the homerun product that iPod, iPhone, and iPad have been. Not everyone will want to wear a computer on their wrist. Eventually, this market will be realized as the personal mesh/personal cloud, but the focus on wearables will be a bit of a headfake..."
Wilson elaborated on his thoughts on Twitter. "I don't think everyone wants a computer on their wrist. But plenty will and I am certain that Apple will sell a lot of them ... I don't think the watch form factor will define wearables in the same way that the smartphone defines the mobile market."
John Legere is more upbeat: Earlier this week, the T-Mobile CEO predicted the Apple Watch launch will "mark the tipping point when wearables go from niche to mainstream."
|Dec. 31, 2014, 2:31 PM|T-Mobile's Legere fires shots at rivals, praises Apple Watch


"AT&T  (T -1.1%) will find new ways to cause their customers pain [in 2015] - especially those still on grandfathered unlimited plans," predicts T-Mobile (TMUS +0.3%) CEO John Legere, feisty as ever while making his 2015 predictions. The FTC recently sued AT&T for throttling the data speeds of unlimited plan users.
Legere, whose company has unleashed a margin-crimping price war against  over the last two years, also forecasts AT&T will launch a "knock off" version of T-Mobile's Data Stash feature, which lets users roll over unused data from monthly buckets for up to 12 months. "The fine print will be massive, and they’ll miss the first and most important step in the process – which is to stop punishing their customers with domestic overages and instead get rid of them."
He isn't any kinder to Verizon (VZ -0.8%), predicting Big Red will "keep trying to baffle American wireless customers with BS promos, like the one they did this year telling customers they could get a free iPhone 6 (don’t forget to read the small print!), as well as misleading advertising about everything from coverage maps to device trade-ins."
As for share-losing Sprint (S +0.6%), Legere sees them "continue throwing out campaigns, offers and promotions – anything to see if it sticks." By mid-year, he expects the carrier to "realize they can’t slash their way to growth and start to invest in their network and customer care."
Two things Legere has kind words for (besides T-Mobile): 1) Apple Watch (NASDAQ:AAPL), which he predicts will "mark the tipping point when wearables go from niche to mainstream." 2) Phablets, which he expects will see 50% sales growth next year and thereby boost data usage.
One positive prediction for the industry in general: Legere forecasts 2/3 of devices sold next year by carriers will be subsidy-free, up from 41% in 2014. The margin improvement that has come from moving customers from subsidies to early-upgrade and installment plans has been a silver lining for the industry during its price war.

Apple (AAPL -0.4%) hardware accounted for 51.3% of the Christmas mobile device activations tracked by leading app analytics firm Flurry, according to data pulled from 600K+ apps. #2 Samsung accounted for 17.7%, and #3 Nokia (Microsoft) 5.8%.
One caveat: The U.S., where the iPhone and the iPad claim outsized smartphone and tablet shares, accounts for a large percentage of both Christmas phone/tablet gifting and Flurry's app tracking. Thus, China's Xiaomi, Huawei, and Lenovo, each of whom had ~5% Q3 global smartphone unit shares (per Gartner), had sub-1% device activation shares.
Nonetheless, with Kantar respectively pegging the iPhone's U.S. and EU5 shares for the August-October period at 41.5% and 20.7%, the data points to strong holiday iPhone 6 demand in the U.S. and Europe. Flurry: "While, the holidays in general and Christmas in particular are not the sole indicator of the smartphone market share and trends, it is safe to say that Apple’s newly released iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus have had a blockbuster holiday season."
SA author J.M. Manness provides an analysis of Flurry's numbers, as well as Fiksu's iPhone model tracking data.

|Dec. 23, 2014, 12:11 PM|Apple reportedly working on new 4" iPhone


Cowen's Tim Arcuri reports Apple (AAPL -0.2%) is working on a new 4" iPhone that could launch in 2015, along with larger models. Sources add the 4" device's specs could resemble the iPhone 5S', albeit with a revamped design.
Arcuri's report follows a similar one from Taiwan's Electronic Times, which (citing supply chain sources) stated Apple plans to launch a new 4" iPhone in 2H15.
Though still offering the 5S and 5C, Apple refrained from launching a new 4" iPhone this fall to go with the 4.7" iPhone 6 and 5.5" 6 Plus. The smaller form factor still has its share of loyalists, and arguably has contributed heavily to the iPhone's success in Japan (Apple's strongest major market in terms of smartphone share).
Depending on their pricing, new 4" iPhones could also help Apple better compete against mid-range Android phones without heavily cannibalizing sales of high-end 4.7" and 5.5" models.
|Dec. 19, 2014, 10:47 AM|Morgan Stanley upbeat about Q4 iPhone sales; BBC probes labor practices


Morgan Stanley, whose internal iPhone (AAPL +0.1%) sales tracker has often (though not always) been more accurate than consensus estimates, says its tracker points to 67M calendar Q4 (FQ1) iPhone sales, above a 63M consensus.
Analyst Katy Huberty (recently hiked her target to $126) notes demand is especially strong in China (nearly 3x global Y/Y growth rates), where plenty of signs point to strong pent-up interest in larger iPhones. U.S. demand is said to be in-line with global trends, and Japan and France "somewhat below."
Huberty adds strong demand could require Apple to fill its channel inventory, particularly given its plans to grow channel inventory target range by a week to 5-7 weeks. A two-week replenish could result in another 7M iPhone sales.
Meanwhile, a BBC undercover probe into the labor practices of Apple contract manufacturer Pegatron is garnering attention. BBC states it "found standards on workers' hours, ID cards, dormitories, work meetings and juvenile workers were being breached," and that one undercover reporter "had to work 18 days in a row despite repeated requests for a day off."
BBC also says it found evidence tin from Indonesian mines using child labor "could be entering [Apple's] supply chain." In an e-mail to U.K. workers, Tim Cook is said to be "deeply offended" by the allegations. This is far from the first time labor practices at Chinese contract manufacturers have come under fire.

An Oakland jury has unanimously ruled Apple (AAPL - unchanged) is not guilty of violating antitrust laws by launching iTunes updates that once prevented iPods from playing DRM-secured content from non-iTunes sources.
Class-action plaintiffs were seeking $350M in damages. In theory, antitrust laws could've put Apple on the hook for more than $1B in the event of a guilty verdict.
Apple argued during the trial the iTunes updates in question delivered meaningful improvements, and that its DRM policies were needed both for security reasons, and to honor commitments with music labels. The company axed its FairPlay DRM system (at the heart of the antitrust complaint) for purchased music in 2009.

The first ten iOS apps to stem from Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) alliance with IBM are now "available to enterprise customers in banking, retail, insurance, financial services, telecommunications and for governments and airlines." Initial clients for the products, offered under the IBM MobileFirst for iOS label, include Citi, Air Canada, and Sprint.
As promised when the partnership was first announced, the apps feature embedded analytics, and are integrated with IBM cloud services built specifically for them. Initial apps include Advise & Grow (for bankers with small business clients), Retention (for insurance agents), Sales Assist (for retail workers), and Case Advise (for government caseworkers). They'll be offered by IBM's massive services arm.
The solutions bolster Apple's growing enterprise sales push, as the company tries to win over traditionally wary CIOs, fend off Google and Samsung's enterprise efforts, and maintain an outsized share of corporate smartphone/tablet activations. Reuters reported in November Apple is also working with various startups to bring enterprise iOS apps to market.
|Dec. 5, 2014, 5:54 PM|UBS hikes FQ1 iPhone forecast following Google checks


UBS' Evidence Lab Phone Monitor, which attempts to gauge iPhone (NASDAQ:AAPL) demand based on Google search activity, forecasts 70.9M iPhone sales for FQ1 (calendar Q4), well above a 64M consensus.
That, in turn, has led analyst Steve Milunovich to hike his sales target by 4M to 67M. He thinks supply constraints will lead sales to be lower than the Phone Monitor's estimate.
Discussing reports of FQ2 iPhone 6 production cuts, Milunovich says UBS' checks don't point to major changes. Nonetheless, he expects production to fall 40% Q/Q in the seasonally weaker quarter, albeit with a mix shift towards the higher-ASP 6 Plus thanks to FQ1 supply constraints and strong Asian demand (previous).
Milunovich has a decent track record (I, II) when it comes to Apple checks. His remarks come two days after JMP reported seeing strong iPhone sales in the U.S. and China, and power amplifier supplier Avago said it expects sales to "a large North American smartphone OEM" (odds are it's not BlackBerry) to remain strong in Q1.
|Dec. 2, 2014, 9:53 AM|Apple lower following cautious Pac Crest, Deutsche notes


Pac Crest, which downgraded Apple (AAPL -1.1%) to Sector Perform following its Sep. 9 iPhone event, believes calendar Q4 (FQ1) will likely represent a peak for iPhone growth. The firm argues current growth is largely being driven by the existing iPhone base rather than new users, and that demand has been pulled in from future quarters.
Meanwhile, Deutsche Taiwan tech analyst Yasuo Nakane has raised his calendar Q4 iPhone 6/6 Plus production forecast by 2M units to 68M, but slashed his forecast for seasonally weak Q1 to 35M-38M units from 49M, citing soft production of 5.5" LCD panels.
Nakane still expects 6 Plus sales to be better than expected prior to its launch, but adds iPhone "production adjustments in 1Q 2015 like those seen last year and two years ago would suggest that demand is not as strong as the buzz in the market and the media portray it and that the consensus is overly optimistic."
Fiksu's tracking data currently shows the iPhone 6's base being 2.7x as large as the 6 Plus' base. That ratio has narrowed from the ~4x seen in early October, when the 6 Plus was very supply-constrained. Altogether, the 6 and 6 Plus are estimated to respectively account for 11.8% and 4.4% of the total iPhone base; the 5S was at 8.1% at a similar point in time.
Cirrus Logic (CRUS -2.5%), which received 73% of its calendar Q3 sales from Apple, is also lower.

Update (12:10PM): Apple has reversed course, and is now up 0.6%. Cirrus, however, is now down 4.9%.

After several analysts upped their Apple (AAPL +1.6%) targets last week, Susquehanna's Chris Caso has joined the party by hiking his target to $135 from $120, while citing strong iPhone 6 Plus demand.
Though still forecasting 60M-65M iPhones will be produced in FQ1 (in-line with a consensus of 63M-64M), Caso thinks the higher-ASP iPhone 6 Plus' production share is "approaching 50%" amid strong demand.
Caso: "At this point, we believe AAPL is producing all they can, and our checks suggest AAPL has reallocated capacity from some of the legacy models to the iPhone 6 Plus." Strong Chinese 6 Plus demand could be helping.

Apple's U.S. site still shows higher shipping times for the 6 Plus compared with the iPhone 6, but times have fallen for many models from a prior 3-4 weeks. The silver 16GB AT&T 6 Plus now has a shipping time of 7-10 business days, and the 64GB version a shipping time of 2-3 weeks. Various checks have pointed to improved availability.

Piper uber-bull Gene Munster joins BMO in reporting improved iPhone 6/6 Plus availability. "Based on our checks, we believe that 58% of the SKUs we track (ATT/Verizon iPhone 6/6+) were available for in-store pickup as of 11/14/14. This compares to 6% on 10/17/14." He expects 100% availability by year's end.
Evercore's Rob Chira predicts the 6/6 Plus will drive a $20 Y/Y increase in iPhone ASP. "Although our forecast for iPhone units +19%Y/Y in CY14 would mean Apple cedes nearly 1% pt of smartphone Unit share to 15%, we [estimate] its share of smartphone market Revenue rather increases +2% pts Y/Y to 35%."
Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty remains an Apple Watch fan (previous), forecasting 30M units will be sold in calendar 2015 (far above buy-side estimates of 10M-12M). "Our AlphaWise survey indicates initial purchase intentions in the U.S. are higher than they were for the iPhone and iPad pre-launch."

Among the big ones: For now, 3rd-party Watch apps will need to interact with complementary iPhone/iPad apps to work. Support for "fully native" apps will arrive next year; Apple doesn't say what restrictions will be placed on them.
Other details: 1) The 38mm version of Watch will have a display resolution of 340x272, and the 42mm version a resolution of 390x312. 2) Two types of notifications are supported: A "Short Look" that appears when a user raises his/her wrist, and a "Long Look" that provides more info. 3) Hard-pressing the screen can yield a menu with 1-4 options. 4) Images are supported; videos aren't.
John Gruber reports hearing the next iPhone will sport a much-improved camera. "I've heard that it's some kind of weird two-lens system where the back camera uses two lenses and it somehow takes it up into DSLR-quality imagery."
Apple appears to be partnering with ad tech platform owner Rubicon Project (RUBI +4.8%) to add support for programmatic (automated) ad buys to iAd. Rubicon published a PR about the deal yesterday (Google cache), but quickly pulled it. To date, iAd purchases have had to go through Apple's sales team.

Whereas Apple stores were sold out of virtually all iPhone 6 models a few weeks ago, retail stores now appear to have almost half of the iPhone 6 models across the various carriers available for walk-in."
Bachman does note there's still "virtually no available stock of iPhone 6 at carrier partner stores, such as AT&T and Verizon." However, online wait times at carrier stores have fallen in half to ~10 days.
Apple's U.S. site typically shows wait times of 7-10 days for the iPhone 6, and 3-4 weeks for the 6 Plus. In October, there were multiple reports stating Apple is boosting 6 Plus production.
Apple has added UnionPay, China's dominant payment-processor, as an App Store payment option.

 Though FQ4 iPhone sales beat estimates, iPhone channel inventory is below Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) historical 4-6 week target range, the company disclosed on the CC. Apple is upping its target range to 5-7 weeks, but doesn't expect to reach it in FQ1. (live blogs: BI, WSJ) As expected, a mix shift towards the iPhone 6 and the costlier/supply-constrained 6 Plus is boosting iPhone ASPs. "We're selling everything that we make," Tim Cook interjected during a question about product mix. iPad channel inventory fell by 500K during FQ4. In spite of the 14% Y/Y drop in iPad revenue, Cook dismisses suggestions the market is saturated, noting over half of sales still go to first-time buyers. He did, however, admit consumers hold onto iPads (less likely to be sold with subsidies/installment plans) longer than they hold onto iPhones. CFO Luca Maestri Maestri noted Apple, like many other U.S. companies, is dealing with forex headwinds caused by a strong dollar. He added forex is factored into FQ1 guidance. Other details: 1) Apple bought 7 more companies in FQ4 (only 4 are known), bringing the FY14 total to 20. 2) App Store revenue rose 36% Y/Y. 3) Cook asserts Mac market share (previous) is at its highest level since 1995.

Spotify is now offering family discounts: While the first family member signing up for its premium service pays the standard $10/month, each additional member pays only $5/month. "This is one of the most asked for features from our audience," says content chief Ken Parks.
Meanwhile, Re/code reports Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been pushing music labels to agree to price cuts that would allow it to sell an overhauled Beats Music streaming service (previous) for just $5/month. However, the site suspects Apple doesn't think the labels will give in, and considers an $8/month rate a more realistic goal.
Pandora (P -1.9%) is lower on an up day for tech. Thus far, the company has done a decent job of staving off threats from subscription-based streaming services.
Spotify, still possibly eying an IPO, had 10M paid subs and 40M active users spread out over 56 markets as of May. Pandora had 3.5M active subs and 76.4M active listeners (mostly in the U.S.) at the end of Q2. Its Q3 report arrives on Thursday.

Not surprisingly, the iPad Air 2's (AAPL -0.9%) pricing starts at $499 (16GB Wi-Fi). As with the iPhone 6, Apple has doubled storage capacities for higher-tier models; 64GB and 128GB Wi-Fi-only models respectively go for $599 and $699. The original Air now starts at $399.

Very little time was spent discussing the iPad Mini 3. Moreover, while the Air 2 features (like the iPhone 6) 802.11ac Wi-Fi and an 8MP rear camera, the Mini 3 offers 802.11n Wi-Fi and a 5MP camera.
The Mini 3's pricing starts at $399, as expected. The Mini 2 (also has a retina display) now starts at $299, and (notably) the original, non-retina Mini is being kept around with a $249 starting price. The price points for the older models could help Apple grab some mid-range share from Android rivals.
A 27" retina iMac featuring an eye-popping 5210x2880 resolution (67% more pixels than 4K) has been shown off. "It's the world's highest-resolution display," declares VP Phil Schiller. The system is still only 5mm thick at its edges, and its display consumes 30% less power than its predecessor's.
Retina iMac models run on quad-core Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Core i5 and i7 CPUs (3.5GHz.-4GHz.), and starts at $2,499. AMD (AMD +1.3%) is supplying a high-end Radeon R9 GPU. The 27" non-retina iMac will start at $1,799, and its 21.5" peer $1,099.
Apple is counting on its new iPads to spark a sales rebound: iPad revenue fell 8% Y/Y in calendar Q2 amid extended upgrade cycles and share gains for low-end Android tablets.
Analyst/Apple fan Ben Thompson recently argued the iPad has been hurt by softening developer support relative to the iPhone, along with the popularity of bigger phones and thinner/lighter PCs (such as the MacBook Air).

The iPad Air 2 (AAPL -0.6%) is only 6.1mm thick - 18% thinner than the original Air and 12% thinner than the iPhone 6. Official battery life is still at 10 hours.
As expected, Apple has added a Touch ID fingerprint sensor (supports Apple Pay), and an anti-reflective coating that reduces glare - Apple claims the lowest reflectivity of any tablet. The device runs on an A8X CPU said to respectively deliver 40% and 150% CPU and GPU performance improvements over the Air's A7 processor.
The Air 2 sports an 8MP rear camera, improved from the Air's 5MP camera. Slo-mo video (120 fps) and burst mode support has been added. The front camera has been updated to include a faster aperture and single-shot HDR support.
Investors aren't excited; shares have dipped slightly after previously trading near breakeven.

A hearing over GT Advanced's (NASDAQ:GTAT) request to shut down its sapphire manufacturing ops and keep many details about its Chap. 11 filing sealed that was originally set for today has been pushed back to Oct. 21, the day after Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) FQ4 report.
GT, Apple, and a committee of creditors agreed to the push-out. Also delayed: A ruling on Apple's objections to GT's attempt to free itself of certain contracts and leases.
Nonetheless, the day wasn't without fresh drama. Bankruptcy judge Henry Boroff grilled Apple over its extensive secrecy requests, questioning how much proprietary info was actually included in many of the docs it wants kept private. "I've got a foot-high stack of documents, and it can't be that it all must be sealed."
Boroff also provided a colorful analogy for the dispute between Apple and its would-be supplier. "I’m seeing what looks incredibly like a construction suit, where a homeowner says to the contractor, 'It didn't come out the way I wanted to,' and the contractor says, 'Well, it would have come out that way if you didn't continue to change the specifications.'"

 Believing the iPhone 6 Plus and higher-capacity iPhone 6 models will drive margin and ASP growth, Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty has added Apple (AAPL -0.4%) to her Best Ideas list ahead of the tech giant's Monday FQ4 report. Huberty, already quite bullish on Apple, notes many sources suggest a large number of consumers are opting for 64GB iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models (unsubsidized U.S. prices of $749 and $849) over cheaper 16GB models. While Apple charges $100 extra for the former, its incremental flash memory cost is a fraction of that figure. Likewise, she sees healthy demand for the 6 Plus (apparently quite popular in China), whose incremental manufacturing cost is believed to be a fraction of its $100 premium relative to comparable iPhone 6 models.
Nonetheless, Huberty's forecast for FQ4 iPhone unit sales is relatively subdued: Citing her firm's Web search sell-through data (often, though not always, accurate), she expects 37M sales, generally in-line with consensus.
Last month, Stifel predicted strong iPhone 6/6 Plus sales would lead Apple's iPhone ASP to rise to $680 or more in FQ1. |Oct. 13, 2014, 2:36 PM|Chinese iPhone 6 pre-orders reportedly top 20M


China's QQ.com believes iPhone 6/6 Plus (AAPL +0.5%) pre-orders (began on Friday) had topped 20M as of Monday morning Beijing time. The site reports 9.5M pre-orders have been recorded by JD.com (JD -1.5%), with slightly over half for the larger/costlier 6 Plus, and thinks pre-orders from Chinese carriers bring the total sum above 20M.
QQ.com previously reported iPhone 6 pre-registrations (not the same as an actual order) had hit 4M as of Oct. 3. Those numbers also pointed to strong interest in the 6 Plus, which Apple is reportedly boosting production of.
For reference, Stifel recently forecast Apple would sell 65.3M iPhones globally in FQ1 (the December quarter). Chinese iPhone 6 sales start on Oct. 17, and FQ4 results are due on Oct. 20.

In a test involving thousands of queries on various subjects, Stone Temple Consulting found Google Now (NASDAQ:GOOG) managed to "completely answer" a question 88% of the time, a rate well above the 53% posted by Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Siri and the 40% delivered by Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Cortana.
In addition, Now showed "enhanced results" (results featuring some kind of knowledge box/panel or structured data) 58% of the time; Siri did so 29% of the time, and Cortana 20%.
Stone Temple was also impressed with Now's ability to return complementary data and detailed results: A query of "Burj Khalifa height" returned (in addition to the skyscraper's height) the heights of various other buildings, and a query of "becoming a firefighter" returned step-by-step instructions from FireScience.org.
Now, which comes built into Google's version of Android and is available on iOS through the (well-downloaded) Google search app, both strengthens Google's mobile search position, and (to the extent the search app is used instead of Mobile Safari on iOS) lowers the company's search traffic acquisition payments to Apple.
It also could be a key differentiator for Google in the realm of wearables, where time and location-sensitive push notifications are viewed as a killer app. The recently-launched Android Wear platform features tight Google Now integration.

"GT believes that it has many claims against Apple arising out of its business relationship with Apple (AAPL - unchanged)," reads a GT Advanced (GTAT -38.7%) bankruptcy court filing.
The company has confirmed it's closing down the Mesa, AZ plant where it has been producing sapphire for Apple, and cutting 890 related jobs. GT claims it's losing $1M/day at the operations it plans to close. A hearing on GT's motion for permission to close the plant is set for Oct. 15.
GT's decision suggests Apple will have to turn to third parties to obtain the sapphire needed for the two Apple Watch models featuring sapphire cover glass. A recent Taiwanese media report stated Apple was aiming to launch the Apple Watch in February, and that supplies are constrained by sapphire output.
The apparent threat to sue comes as crucial details about GT's bankruptcy filing remain sealed due to a confidentially agreement (almost certainly with Apple) said to carry a penalty of $50M per violation.
Apple is near breakeven in spite of a 2.2% Nasdaq drop.
|Oct. 9, 2014, 9:37 AM|Oppenheimer upgrades Apple; iPhone demand reportedly causes iPad delay


While Carl Icahn pounds the table for Apple (AAPL +1%) and Apple buybacks once more, Oppenheimer's Andrew Uerkwitz has upgraded shares to Outperform, and set a $115 target.
Uerkwitz: "We believe iPhone 6 and 6 Plus combined will be the best selling iPhone generation to-date as iOS 8 and larger displays draw much broader consumer appeal than before." He expects new iPhone 6/iOS 8 features such as Apple Pay, HealthKit, HomeKit, and deeper iOS/Mac OS integration boosting "user stickiness."
The upgrade follows a bullish coverage launch from BofA/Merrill, and a Deutsche downgrade.
Meanwhile, the WSJ reports strong iPhone 6 demand has caused Apple suppliers to push back mass-production of a 12.9" iPad to early 2015 from December. "The output of the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus remains unsatisfactory," says one source. Digitimes recently reported Apple was shifting production from the standard iPhone 6 to the higher-ASP, supply-constrained 6 Plus.
Icahn's $203/share Apple target assumes a valuation of 19x FY15E EPS exc. net cash. He respectively forecasts 44%, 30%, and 30% earnings growth and 25%, 21%, and 21% revenue growth for the next 3 years (well above consensus estimates) on the back of "significant" high-end smartphone share gains.
Notably, Icahn thinks Apple can sell 72.5M watches in FY17 at a steep ASP of $450. He also says (albeit while cautioning it might never happen)  he has "good enough reason to expect" Apple will release a 4K TV set in FY16, and predicts 25M units will be sold in FY17 at a $1,500 ASP.

IDC estimates global PC shipments were down 1.7% Y/Y in Q3 to 78.5M, better than an expected 4.1%. The decline is even with Q2's rate, and better than Q1's 4.4% and Q4 2013's 5.6%. Gartner estimates shipments fell only 0.5%. Developed markets continue faring better than emerging markets still getting hit by tablet cannibalization. IDC thinks U.S. shipments rose 4.3%, a bit slower than Q2's 6.9% growth. EMEA grew, while Asia-Pac (exc. Japan) declined. Japanese growth remained "deeply negative." The corporate migration from Windows XP to Windows 7 (following MSFT's ending of XP support) is still providing a lift, as is a soft tablet market. However, IDC cautions demand for "large commercial refreshes" remains low. Notably, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) finally managed to crack IDC's list of the top-5 global vendors: With the help of a strong U.S. market and Mac price cuts, Apple's unit share rose an estimated 60 bps to 6.3%. Revenue share is likely above 10%, given Apple's calendar Q2 Mac ASP was $1,255. U.S. unit share was at 13%. The four companies ahead of Apple all grew their shares as well, gaining ground against vendors with less scale: Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) was at 20% (+230 bps), H-P (NYSE:HPQ) at 18.8% (+130 bps), Dell at 13.3% (+140 bps), and Acer (OTC:ACEIY) at 8.4% (+100 bps).

The withdrawal came after Apple repurchased $14B worth of shares in a 2-week span. In April, the company upped its buyback authorization by $30B to $90B.

In the wake of GT Advanced's (GTAT +132.5%) bankruptcy filing, the WSJ reports Apple (AAPL -0.2%) chose not to use sapphire cover glass for the iPhone 6 following tests in which sapphire "proved brittle, cracking when phones were dropped from various heights and angles."
A September Time column noted this potential issue (among others). iPhone Gorilla Glass supplier Corning (GLW -1.1%) must be pleased to see the report.
The WSJ also reports (not surprisingly) Apple is withholding a final $139M prepayment to GT, which depended on operational targets being hit.
Susquehanna thinks Apple may take possession of the GT sapphire equipment at Apple's Mesa, AZ facility, given its prepayments ($440M to date) were "structured as secured debt." GT shares are rebounding today, but are still only at $1.85.
An App Store support page indicates 47% of iOS users are now on iOS 8, up just slightly from 46% as of Sep. 21. Bugs related to mobile connectivity (since fixed) and iCloud Drive could be slowing uptake, as might complaints about Wi-Fi speeds and battery life.
Digitimes, historically better at reporting on supply chain activity than new product features, reports Apple has two 12.9" iPad prototypes: One is a standard tablet, and the other a 2-in-1 device supporting both iOS and Mac OS.
Tim Cook famously panned the idea of an integrated tablet/PC. Moreover, iOS and Mac OS currently rely on different CPU architectures - the former uses ARM, and the latter x86.
Digitimes also reports Apple has boosted iPhone 6 Plus production relative to the iPhone 6, following strong 6 Plus demand. Fiksu's data still shows the iPhone 6 having a 3.8x usage edge over the supply-constrained 6 Plus. However, early Chinese registration data showed a nearly even split between the phones.

Reinstating coverage on Apple (AAPL +0.4%) and upgrading to Buy from Neutral with price target lifted to $120 from $98, analyst Wamsi Mohan cites an iPhone "super cycle" of 195M units in fiscal 2015, driving his team's estimates to $220B or $7.86 per share vs. the Street at $200B and $7.27. Also noted is multi-quarter gross margin expansion driven by higher ASP thanks to 30% of new iPhone 6 sales skewed to the Plus version, and the incremental benefit of higher memory models.
There's also the ecosystem, and Mohan says Apple Pay can conservatively be  worth $10 per share over the next three years, and Apple Watch worth $5 per share. And don't forget the $165B war chest which can be used to enter new markets, boost share repurchases, and allow dividend hikes.

"It seems abundantly clear that there was a fundamental, severe breakdown in the relationship between Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and GT," says Raymond James' Pavel Molchanov, taking stock of GT Advanced's (NASDAQ:GTAT) bombshell Chap. 11 announcement.
Molchanov, who downgraded GT to Underperform on Aug. 28, speculates Apple may have "unilaterally opted for a different sapphire supplier for purely business reasons," or that GT's Mesa, AZ plant may have "suffered serious technical defects and was unable to meet the agreed-upon obligations with Apple." He expects GT's equity will most likely prove worthless.
Gilford Securities Nimal Vallipuram thinks Apple may have requested "prepayment of some loans due to GTAT not meeting performance targets related to sapphire manufacturing." Nonetheless, he doesn't get why "the two companies did not restructure the agreement to buy some time for GTAT."

Matt Margolis: "It is evident now that GTAT did not meet the required metrics to receive the final prepayment from Apple. In addition, GTAT burned through $248m of cash during the past two months." Back in August, GT said it expected a final $139M prepayment from Apple by the end of October.

A Tencent news site reports Chinese iPhone 6/6 Plus (AAPL -0.2%) registrations (not the same as pre-orders) have now topped 4M. Yesterday, WantChinaTimes reported 1M registrations had been recorded by Chinese carriers within 6 hours of beginning to accept them.
Interestingly, Chinese online retailer Jingdong (JD.com) is said to have taken slightly more registrations for the 6 Plus than the 6 (1.19M vs. 1.11M). By contrast, Fiksu reports the iPhone 6 still maintains nearly a 4:1 global usage edge over the supply-constrained 6 Plus.
Nonetheless, the reported Jingdong figures mesh with the Chinese market's love of phablets. A skew towards the 6 Plus would boost Apple's iPhone ASP.
Separately, Re/code reports Apple is talking to music labels about lowering their streaming service licensing fees, thus allowing an ad-free service to be offered for less than the standard $10/month. The request comes amid rapid growth in streaming license fee revenue, and a decline in paid music downloads.

Apple (AAPL -0.4%) will start taking Chinese iPhone 6 pre-orders on Oct. 10, ahead of the Oct. 17 start of in-store sales. With over 40% of Chinese smartphone buyers estimated to be opting for 5"+ phones, pent-up demand for larger iPhones is likely considerable. At the same time, Chinese carriers have been slashing high-end phone subsidies following government pressure.
A Taiwanese media report states Apple is looking to launch the Apple Watch (officially due in "early 2015") in February, and that supplies are constrained by sapphire output.
That follows a report from Hong Kong's Apple Daily that Quanta will start Apple Watch mass-production in January, and one from The Information suggesting the watch might not ship before Valentine's Day. The standard Apple Watch and high-end Apple Watch Edition (has an 18-karat gold case) use sapphire, while the Apple Watch Sport doesn't.

Bendgate isn't a concern for Stifel's Aaron Rakers: Citing "continued strong demand data points" for the iPhone 6 (AAPL +1.4%) and an expectation Chinese sales will start by year's end, he's raising respectively raising his FQ4 and FQ1 iPhone sales estimates by 1.8M and 6.7M to 39.6M and 65.3M, while reiterating a Buy.
Rakers adds a stronger mix of iPhone 6/6 Plus sales could yield upside to his forecasts. He thinks the 6/6Plus could account for 60-70% of FQ1 iPhone sales, leading iPhone ASP to rise to $680 or higher. ASP was only at $561 in FQ3, and $596 in FQ2.
The iPhone 6 carries unsubsidized U.S. prices of $649-$849, and the 6 Plus prices of $749-$949. Rakers notes Apple's decision to double the storage capacities of higher-capacity models could also provide an ASP lift.
BMO's Keith Bachman (Outperform) has upped his FY15 (ends Sep. '15) iPhone sales estimate by 10.6M units to 189M. The hike comes even though Bachman "[remains] unclear about Apple’s ability to sell the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in China, particularly in the December quarter."

An Apple customer support rep has told The Next Web a bent iPhone 6/6 Plus could be replaced under warranty if it passes a test called a Visual Mechanical Inspection. Apple's support team added the company is looking into the issue "with an insane amount of detail."

A poll done by 9to5 Mac (32K votes so far) currently shows 18.4% of respondents saying they're putting off buying an iPhone 6 until the issue is resolved, and 11.4% saying they own an iPhone 6 and are concerned. 46% are unconcerned, and 23% say they're not worried enough to have it affect their decision.
Meanwhile, Apple has released a workaround for iOS 8.01 installers who have seen their cellular radios and Touch ID sensors disabled by the update; the workaround requires users to re-install iOS 8. Apple says a new update (iOS 8.02) will arrive "in the next few days."

Yesterday: Apple roundup

Update:  Apple says only 9 customers have complained about bent iPhone 6 units thus far, and insists bending is rare under normal use.
|Sep. 24, 2014, 4:12 PM|Apple roundup: Bendgate, iOS 8.01, iPhone 6 mix, Mac sales



Antennagate 2.0? Apple (AAPL -0.9%) is declining to comment for now on growing reports the 5.5" iPhone 6 Plus occasionally bends after being left in a user's front pocket for a long period of time.
A video of a bending test done by Unbox Therapy has racked up over 7M views. Unbox also did a similar test for the 5.7" Galaxy Note 3 (has a plastic case rather than an aluminum one), and found it held up relatively better.
Apple released and quickly pulled iOS 8.01, an update that fixed a bug related to the company's new HealthKit platform (among other things). Some users reported the update led to the disabling of their cellular service.
With the 6 Plus supply-constrained, mobile ad platform Fiksu reports over 6x as many iPhone users tracked by its network are using the iPhone 6 than the 6 Plus (2.1% vs. 0.32%). A bright spot: At a similar point in time, only 0.89% of users were using an iPhone 5S, and 0.36% a 5C. 29.4% of users are on iOS 8, compared with 54.5% who were on iOS 7 at a similar point.

NPD estimates U.S. Mac sales between July 4 and Labor Day rose 14% Y/Y, while Windows sales declined 3%. Macs made up an estimated 26.8% of PC sales, Windows systems 68.4%, and Chromebooks 4.5%.
Apple reported a 13% Y/Y increase in Mac revenue (to $5.5B) for the June quarter. The launch of cheaper models is likely helping.
|Sep. 22, 2014, 7:24 PM|Apple roundup: Beats Music, iPhone 6 sales, sapphire



Re/code: "Based on conversations with people familiar with Apple’s (AAPL +0.1%) thinking: Apple won’t shutter the [Beats Music] streaming service. It may, however, modify it over time, and one of those changes could involved changing the Beats Music brand."
Re/code's report follows one from TechCrunch stating Apple is planning to shut down Beats Music and "sunset the Beats Music brand." Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr says TechCrunch's report is "not true," but doesn't elaborate.

Gene Munster estimates ~8M of the 10M+  iPhone 6 units Apple sold over the weekend wound up being purchased by consumers, with the remaining ~2M going into the channel. That implies 45% consumer sell-through growth over estimated first-weekend iPhone 5S sales of 5.5M.
Patently Apple notes Apple has filed a patent application for a new sapphire glass-strengthening process. The application relates to the use of coatings on a material such as sapphire.
GT Advanced (GTAT +1%), whose shares were hit hard by news that the iPhone 6 (unlike the Apple Watch) doesn't use sapphire cover glass, closed higher today. Last week, Time took a look at the technology challenges that may have led Apple to opt against using sapphire cover glass for the iPhone 6.
|Sep. 22, 2014, 4:08 PM|Report: Apple shutting down Beats Music (updated)



Five sources tell TechCrunch Apple (AAPL +0.1%) plans to shut down the Beats Music streaming service. The site adds many Beats Music engineers "have already been moved off the product and onto other projects at Apple, including iTunes."
Tim Cook praised Beats Music shortly after the Apple-Beats deal was announced, declaring the streaming music service to be "the first one that really got it right." However, as TechCrunch observes, having a Beats-branded service run in parallel with iTunes-branded services runs counter to "Apple’s penchant for simple, unified brands."
Given Cook's remarks, and the fact former Beats Music chief Ian Rogers is now in charge of iTunes Radio, the launch of an Apple-branded streaming music service that leverages Beats' technology is a strong possibility. One TechCrunch source says Apple "may roll streaming into iTunes."
Beats Music had seen 5M downloads as of May, but claimed only 250K paid subs. Notably, its apps are available on Android and Windows Phone in addition to iOS.

Earlier: First weekend iPhone 6/6 Plus sales top 10M

Update: Re/code reports Apple isn't planning to shutter Beats Music, but may make changes that include doing away with the Beats Music brand.
|Sep. 22, 2014, 8:56 AM|First weekend iPhone sales top 10M


"Sales for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus exceeded our expectations for the launch weekend, and we couldn't be happier," says Tim Cook as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reports the sale of more than 10M of the new devices on their opening weekend.
One year ago, Apple sold 9M of the iPhone 5S and 5C on their opening weekend. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are not yet available for purchase in China, while the 5S and 5C initially were up for sale there last year.
The 6 and 6 Plus started selling at stores in 10 regions on Friday, and will be available in 20 additional countries by the end of this week and 115 countries by year-end.

|Sep. 19, 2014, 4:01 AM|Long lines seen worldwide for iPhone 6 release


Thousands are lining up all over the world for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) new release of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. The record demand for the bigger-screen smartphones has already outstripped supply, with preorders selling out last week.
The two went on sale today in Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan, before rolling out in France, Germany, Puerto Rico, Canada and the U.S.
The iPhone release is Apple's most important event this year, with the devices generating more than half of the company’s $171B revenue in 2013.
|Sep. 17, 2014, 8:15 PM|iPhone reviews roll in and are uniformly positive

 Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) enjoys a steady stream of positive reviews for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. 
WSJ’s Geoffrey Fowler: “Apple has successfully addressed its size deficiency, and much more... Performance, usability and camera refinements, coupled with a safe,  powerful operating system that now lets the iPhone's big collection of  apps do more." Re/Code’s Walt Mossberg, formerly the WSJ tech guru, on CNBC: "It's the best smartphone on the market, when you combine its hardware,  all-new operating system, and the Apple ecosystem whose doors it opens." 
David Pogue of Yahoo! Tech: The "two new iPhones are excellent. Beautiful. State of the art... a thin, sexy phone with a killer camera."
Only NYT's Molly Wood casts a discouraging word; she's mostly favorable, praising the software inside the new phones, but adds that AAPL in some ways falls short in taking advantage of the bigger screens. Meanwhile, AAPL is delaying the release of new health-tracking software it has touted as one of the main features of its new operating system for the iPhone and iPad. |Sep. 17, 2014, 6:30 PM|iPhone 6 first weekend sales could disappoint, Bernstein analyst says


First weekend sales results for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 6 and 6 Plus could disappoint, Bernstein's Toni Sacconaghi warns, noting AAPL's pre-order announcement and customer expected delivery dates point to stronger supply constraints vs. prior years and China's absence as a launch country.
Sacconaghi estimates first weekend shipments could come in at 7M-8M units rather than expectations for as high as 10M units or even the 9M iPhone 5S and 5Cs shipped last year.
But the analyst says investors should bear in mind that "first weekend sales" are principally a function of available supply rather than iPhone demand; a slower ramp could ultimately prove beneficial for AAPL, since a later China rollout could push sales forward and help smooth the iPhone's typical March quarter falloff.

 Apple (AAPL +0.5%) will unveil two new iPads and release the next version of its Mac operating system at its next event on Oct. 21, according to a report from Daily Dot.com.
AAPL reportedly plans to unveil the sixth generation of its iPad and the third edition  of iPad mini during the event and to release the OS X Yosemite, a complete visual overhaul  for the Mac, immediately thereafter. |Sep. 16, 2014, 8:41 AM|Question over iPhone 6 China availability sends China Mobile, Apple lower


According to a report in the state-owned 21st Century Business Herald, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may not get Beijing's approval for iPhone 6 sales until next year.
Meanwhile, China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Chairman Xi Guohua tells reporters he doesn't know when the new iPhones will be available, and his company will focus on selling cheaper phones which don't require subsidies. "The direction of our development is to completely focus on the mass market,” says Xi. “We have 4G devices selling for ¥1K. I believe, subsidy or no subsidy, discount or no discount, the common person will be able to appreciate this.”

|Sep. 15, 2014, 8:56 AM|Trials set to begin for Apple's HealthKit


Doctors at Stanford U. are set to begin an evaluation of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) HealthKit in the management of patients with diabetes. The goal is the improve the sharing of data between patients and physicians. HealthKit will provide a critical link between monitoring devices, frequently used at home, and medical information services relied upon by doctors.
Initially, two young diabetes patients will each be sent home with an iPod touch to monitor their blood sugar levels between visits to the doctor. Their blood monitoring equipment (DexCom is currently negotiating with Apple, Stanford and the FDA about integrating with HealthKit) measures glucose levels every five minutes via a tiny sensor inserted under the skin in the abdominal area. It then sends the data to DexCom's mobile iPhone app which can then be uploaded into charting software for viewing by clinicians.
Duke University is developing a similar pilot program to monitor blood pressure and other vitals for patients with cancer or heart disease.
The trials will be expanded rapidly if there are no significant problems.
|Sep. 15, 2014, 8:39 AM|Apple Pay an "iPod moment"


Calling the introduction of Apple Pay an "iPod moment for cash and credit cards," the team at the FT - citing those who are familiar with the terms of the agreement - reports Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will get $0.15 for every $100 worth of purchases, a deal others - including Google - have been unable to negotiate with credit card companies.
"That makes Apple Pay unique," says mobile payment veteran Dickson Chu. "It's somewhat surprising that Apple was able to negotiate something Google couldn’t.”
Another executive at a payment technology company is surprised banks were so willing to concede to Apple after what happened to the record labels. Banks, however, are wiling to give up per-transaction revenues in the hope of more volume. “What Apple really announced was the end of the plastic credit card, but not the end of paying by credit,” says the head of the Electronic Transactions Association.
In other news - without giving details - AT&T announces a record iPhone pre-order launch day, and Apple announces first day pre-orders of  the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus of more than 4M units.

|Sep. 12, 2014, 6:35 PM|Apple Pay will contribute little to profit, Nomura analyst says


Nomura’s Stuart Jeffrey isn't particularly impressed with Apple Pay, believing that the service won’t boost AAPL earnings much and reinforcing his broader concern that “We continue to view Apple’s execution as industry leading but note that major leaps forward are increasingly difficult and have an ever smaller impact on growth given Apple’s near $200B revenue level."
The analyst roughly calculates what AAPL could make if it captures a large proportion of digital transactions: a maximum $0.13 additional EPS in FY 2016 and revenue upside of $400M-$1.2B, equivalent to a revenue boost of 0.3%-0.6%.
Jeffrey concludes the main value to AAPL of the new payment platform is to drive iPhone sales.

 Apple's (AAPL +0.1%) iPhone 6 Plus is now on backorder and not available to ship for 3-4 weeks in the U.S., judging by Apple.com shipment quotes after the device went on sale after midnight. The iPhone 6 Plus, the larger of the two iPhone 6 models offered, is showing a shipment time of 3-4 weeks rather than delivery on the first day of sale, Sept. 19th, for the iPhone 6. Also, BGR reports that iPhone 6 Plus units through AT&T (T -0.4%) will now ship in 21-28 business  days, Verizon's (VZ -0.6%) models are backordered until Oct. 7 (for 64 GB) or Oct. 14 (16 GB and 128 GB), and Sprint (S +7.3%) says all of its shipments are currently delayed. 
Worldwide demand also is said to be high for the Plus, with customers in  France and the U.K. saying the larger iPhone has sold out. AAPL is expected to announce next weekend the total initial sales results for the first three days of availability. |Sep. 11, 2014, 7:08 PM|Apple back above $600B in market cap, Exxon hangs on vs. Google for no. 2

 Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares tilt slightly lower premarket, -0.4%, as analysts begin to weigh in on yesterday's new product launches (I, II, III). Goldman Sachs reiterates its Buy rating and raises its price target to $115 from $107, saying the launch met high  expectations; the firm sees the larger-screen iPhones as an important driver of  improved growth in the segment, with Apple Pay and Apple Watch serving  as key platform enhancements and further sources of stickiness for iOS. Mizuho maintains its Buy rating and lifts its target to $110 from $105; it expects Apple Pay to gain some traction, but notes there are multiple new  technologies trying to penetrate the market and it remains to be seen how successful each of will be (Briefing.com).
Pacific Crest, however, downgrades shares to Sector Perform from Outperform with an unchanged $100 target, saying the new products lack profit drivers; the downgrade is not a complete surprise, as the firm warned about a potential cut last week.

 Apple (AAPL +4.8%) plans to launch a mobile payment solution called Pay in a bid to replace physical wallets, credit cards, and other mobile wallet services which have "failed" - according to CEO Tim Cook. The company will use its Passbook app and a customer's iTunes account details to store payment information, while NFC and touch ID technology will be utilized. The major credit card companies are already on board and Apple is lining up powerhouse banks. Shares of eBay (EBAY -1.9%) have dipped off the development. Apple will launch iOS 8 on September 17 in front of the September 19 release date for its new iPhone 6 in the U.S. More on the iPhone 6: Wi-Fi calling will be available for both new products. 14 hours of 3G talk time for the 6 and 24 hours for the Plus are promised. The phones feature a new sensor which serves as a barometer to measure elevation changes (Nike (NKE +0.1%) is on board). The 8MP iSight camera appears to be a serious jump in quality (video at 1080p and a slo-mo option at 240 fps). FaceTime gets a serious upgrade through the new front-facing camera. Pricing tops out at $399 for the 128GB iPhone 6 with a two-year contract.

 Carl Icahn says he has not sold Apple (AAPL +1.6%) shares, and in fact he is adding to his position, Bloomberg's Trish Regan tweets after talking  with the hedge fund manager ahead of today's iPhone event. "Where else can you get a growth company at 10x earnings?" Icahn reportedly tells  Regan. "While everyone is worried about the new products today, I just  look at the math."
The news comes amid market rumors that an Icahn sell-program led to the Sept. 3 selloff in the stock. |Sep. 9, 2014, 9:23 AM|Nervous times for retail sector ahead of Apple event

 A large patch of the retail sector will have their ears perked up this afternoon to see what Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) delivers up with its iWatch announcement or teaser. Though the company's entry into wearable technology is considered nearly a certainty, the unknown variable is if the product will end up falling under the "gadget" category or be another Apple device revolution. 
Computerworld's Mike Egan is in the latter camp: "The iWatch should be most comparable to the Mac and the iPhone, Apple's two most stunning revolution." Forrester Research isn't waiting for details, forecasting 10M iWatch sales by 2016 - a mark which could dent demand for high-end watches. Showtime is 1:00 pm ET.

Several analysts defended Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) today ahead of tomorrow's media event in Cupertino, advising investors that because valuation is lower than at some previous points when AAPL has updated the iPhone, the pressure for shares to correct after the event is not as great this time.
UBS‘s Steve Milunovich thinks investors should stick with AAPL despite a potential sell-on-the-news reaction, because “the upgrade cycle could exceed expectations at solid margins with 40% of U.S. buyers let alone Asian consumers wanting larger screen handsets.”
Cowen's Timothy Arcuri reiterates an Outperform rating, urging investors not to sell this week’s iPhone 6 launch, since "the set-up is, dare we say, different this time," and the Street's "obsession" with the new iPhone has resulted in an underestimation of iOS-based wearables.
Piper Jaffray's Gene Munster, however, expects shares to see some slight headwinds on both the day of the event and the day of the iPhone launch, based on historical trading patterns.

Marc Newson, whose industrial designs have covered and influenced everything from furniture to watches to electronics to airplanes, will be joining Jony Ive's design team at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Ive: "Marc is without question one of the most influential designers of this generation ... We are particularly excited to formalize our collaboration as we enjoy working together so much." A 2012 NYT column: "As a practical matter it’s easier to list what Marc Newson hasn’t designed than what he has ... What gratifies him about the success of Apple products, beyond the fact that the Apple design chief, Jonathan Ive, is one of his best friends, is that it has vindicated the value of design."

Apple's (AAPL +0.5%) smartwatch will join the iPhone 6 in sporting an NFC radio that will enable a tap-to-pay payments solution, the WSJ reports. Given recent reports, NXP (NXPI +0.5%) is the likely chip supplier.
The WSJ also backs up the Nikkei in stating the watch will feature a curved OLED display - a moderate positive for Universal Display (OLED +6.8%) - and reiterates two sizes will be offered.
At the same time, Apple is said to be "still working out engineering kinks in production," and one source says there's "no way" the watch ships this year (meshes with a re/code report). Pre-orders will be taken in advance.
No word on pricing; re/code has reported Apple has mulled a $400 price point. Unsurprisingly, Jony Ive is said to have overseen development. Ive has reportedly boasted Apple's watch spells trouble for Switzerland.
Meanwhile, KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo reports the watch will have 8GB of storage, and that the display sizes will respectively be 1.3" and 1.5". Kuo reported of NFC support back in April, and of limited 2014 production in July.

Six months after upgrading Apple (AAPL -3%) to Outperform on iPhone 6 hopes, Pac Crest's Andy Hargreaves recommends investors start taking profits.
Though keeping his rating for now, Hargreaves says a downgrade could arrive if Apple's Sep. 9 event doesn't reveal products/services that "suggest massive incremental profit opportunities." He doubts Apple's rumored wearable and payments platform will "drive incremental profits that are meaningful at Apple's scale in the near to medium term," and is hoping some "clarifying detail" will be given at the event.

Following reports Apple (AAPL +0.8%) is working on a mobile payments platform leveraging NFC radios, Touch ID fingerprint sensors, and 800M+ iTunes accounts, Stifel thinks Apple may have finally "cracked the code" for getting consumers to make offline payments with their phones rather than credit/debit cards.
Stifel: "With NFC and iBeacon to follow, we expect Apple’s payments product to be more focused on physical, brick-and-mortar retail than online ... We think Apple correctly sees a much bigger opportunity offline where consumer adoption is still negligible."
RBC sees a chance to create a loyalty points system for Apple products/services. Forbes' Mark Rogowsky thinks tech advances, Apple's scale, and the pending U.S. adoption of chip-and-PIN readers (will increase NFC reader support and make card payments slightly less convenient) amount to "a perfect storm" that can allow Apple's platform to succeed in spite of the failures of existing NFC solutions (Isis, Google Wallet, etc.).
PayPal owner eBay (EBAY -0.9%) is off moderately. PayPal has made a number of moves to expand into offline payments, but uptake has been limited. It handled $27B in mobile transactions last year, largely for online payments. Unlike Apple's solution (from all indications), PayPal's mobile payments offerings support both Android and iOS.

Reported Apple NFC chip supplier NXP (NXPI +0.7%) is adding to its recent gains.

Top NFC chip supplier NXP (NXPI -0.2%) might also benefit if the iPhone 6 supports NFC. While many Android OEMs have embraced the technology, Apple has remained a holdout, and (with early NFC-based payments platforms seeing limited uptake) has even questioned NFC's practical value.

In addition to showing off the iPhone 6, Apple (AAPL +1.2%) will "unveil a new wearable" on Sep. 9, re/code's John Paczkowski reports.
Paczkowski, who originally reported of a Sep. 9 iPhone event date and has a decent track record, doesn't use the term "iWatch" in his report. He does state Apple's wearable will "make good use" of its recently-announced HealthKit and HomeKit platforms.

The Nikkei previously reported the iWatch will have a flexible OLED display and initial production of 3M-5M units/month. The WSJ has reported of multiple models, sapphire cover glass, and "more than 10 sensors to track and monitor health and fitness data."

It would be Apple's (AAPL -0.4%) largest-ever iPad (current versions are 9.7" and 7.9"), and production is set to start early next year, reports Bloomberg. The move comes as sales for iPads have declined for two straight quarters, and suggests the company is going to go after enterprise customers where the larger device could replace the traditional laptop.
Apple, of course, has partnered with IBM, and Tim Cook has said part of the rationale behind the deal was to sell to corporations as a "catalyst for future iPad growth."

|Aug. 22, 2014, 10:50 AM|Reuters: iPhone 6 LCD production slowed by late redesign



Reuters reports Apple (AAPL +0.4%) originally wanted the iPhone 6 to use a single LCD backlight film layer instead of the normal two, but changed its mind after finding a single layer wasn't bright enough.
The about-face is said to have put screen assembly "on hold for part of June and July." Production is now back on track, and suppliers are "working flat-out to make up for lost time." The WSJ reported in July Apple has placed orders for 70M-80M iPhone 6 units to be produced by Dec. 30.
Japan Display, Sharp (OTCPK:SHCAY), and LG Display (LPL -2.6%) are reportedly the iPhone 6's LCD suppliers. Japan Display has previously said shipments for "a large customer" (believed to be Apple) might be delayed in calendar Q3.
Apple has shrugged off the report, and is trading near $101.

"We believe iWatch is an underappreciated market opportunity with the potential for up to 60M shipments in the first year," writes Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty, bullish as ever on Apple (AAPL +1.2%).
Not surprisingly (given the watch industry's traditional margins), she thinks the iWatch will carry a 40%+ gross margin, thus boosting Apple's total GM.
Huberty also praises Apple's hiring of "over a dozen leaders in key areas of competency, including fashion, medical research, digital content & marketing, and wearables," and believes Tim Cook "now has the bench in place to execute on new product categories."
Shares have topped $100 for the first time since the split, and are close to a split-adjusted Sep. 2012 high of $100.72.

The Guardian reports production of iPhone 6 (NASDAQ:AAPL) displays featuring sapphire cover glass are expected to "go into large-scale production this month," courtesy of GT Advanced's (NASDAQ:GTAT) Mesa, AZ facility.
The paper adds both the 4.7" and 5.5" models will sport sapphire cover glass; reports have varied on whether both models will support it, or (due to production constraints) only the 5.5" model.

The WSJ has reported Apple plans to protect iWatch displays with sapphire, and is thinking of doing the same for "more expensive" iPhone 6 models, if supply isn't an issue.
Apple's iPhone 6 launch event is expected to take place on Sep. 9.

|Aug. 15, 2014, 12:19 PM|Apple roundup: Hedge funds, IDC data, China


David Einhorn took some Apple (AAPL -0.4%) profits in Q2: Greenlight Capital owned 9.4M Apple shares at the end of June, down from a split-adjusted 14M at the end of March.
On the other hand, Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors bought 1.3M shares during the quarter; Cooperman had bailed out of Apple in Q3 of last year. Adjusted for the split, Carl Icahn's position is roughly steady at 52.8M shares.

IDC estimates the iPhone accounted for 11.7% of Q2 smartphone units, down from 13% a year ago. Android's (NASDAQ:GOOG) share rose to 84.7% from 79.6%, and industry shipments grew an estimated 25.3% (down slightly from Q1's 28.6%) to 301.3M.
At the same time, IDC notes over 80% of iPhone shipments ($561 Q2 ASP) involved a $400+ unsubsidized price, with the remainder in the $200-$400 range. Nearly 60% of Android shipments involved sub-$200 phones, with the remainder split almost evenly between $200-$400 and $400+ devices.
Following government pressure, China Mobile has cut its 2014 phone subsidy budget to $3.4B from a prior $5.5B. With the carrier having spent $2.5B on subsidies in 1H14, its fall iPhone 6 subsidies will likely be light.
Meanwhile, Apple has begun storing some of its iCloud data for Chinese users on local servers provided by China Telecom (CHA -0.3%). Apple insists the move, which comes amid ongoing NSA-related tensions, was partly made to improve local iCloud performance/reliability.
|Aug. 12, 2014, 9:23 AM|Apple suppliers reportedly start producing new iPads



Bloomberg reports Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) suppliers have begun manufacturing next-gen iPad Air and Mini models. The former is expected to launch near the end of Q3 or the beginning of Q4 - recent launch timings suggest October is a strong possibility - and the latter is expected to be available by year's end.
The news service adds the next-gen Air will have an anti-reflective coating, and that there have been "manufacturing complications" related to it. KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo has reported the next-gen Air and Mini will have an A8 CPU and fingerprint sensor, and that the former will get an 8MP rear camera (improved from the current 5MP).
The report comes amid weakening demand for both the iPad and the tablet market in general, thanks to phablet cannibalization and long upgrade cycles. iPad unit shipments fell 9% Y/Y in the June quarter to 13.3M; revenue fell 8% to $5.5B. IDC estimates global tablet shipments rose 11% in Q2, with Apple's unit share falling to 26.9% from 33% (revenue share is likely north of 40%).
To boost demand, and perhaps also bolster the IBM deal, Apple recently launched an ad campaign that emphasizes the iPad's value as a productivity tool. Both the iWork suite and Microsoft's Office iPad apps are highlighted.
|Aug. 8, 2014, 11:37 AM|China refutes Apple procurement report; USPTO rejects patent claims


The Chinese government has refuted a Bloomberg report stating ten Apple (AAPL -0.7%) products (inc. MacBooks and iPads) were excluded from a list of items that could be procured with government funds.
The government says Apple never applied to be on the list, which relates to energy-saving products, and that its products can still be purchased. "Even though Apple has the certification for energy-saving products... it has never provided the necessary verification material and agreements according to the regulations."
Separately, the USPTO has rejected multiple claims in Apple's '172 text autocomplete patent (patent filing), including one successfully asserted in its second California suit against Samsung (claim #18). Prior art is cited.
Apple can (and likely will) appeal the decision. The rejection comes shortly after Apple and Samsung agreed to drop all suits against each other outside the U.S.

Update: Bloomberg now reports Apple products were kept off a procurement list after the company "failed to submit documents that included a pledge not to violate state or public interests."
|Aug. 6, 2014, 7:02 PM|Apple roundup: Chinese government, schools, UBS estimates


Bloomberg reports the Chinese government has excluded ten Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) products, including iPad and MacBook models, from the list of items that can be bought with government funds.
Bloomberg's report doesn't mention the iPhone, and (from all indications) government purchases are only a small fraction of Apple's Greater China sales (+28% Y/Y in FQ3 to $5.9B). However, the report highlights China's growing scrutiny of U.S. tech companies following last year's NSA uproar. Microsoft and IBM are among the other companies in the crosshairs.

The Atlantic observes some U.S. schools are backtracking on iPad deployment plans in favor of Chromebooks and other laptops. Both costs and productivity have been cited. "Students saw the iPad as a 'fun' gaming environment, while the Chromebook was perceived as a place to 'get to work,'" the magazine writes about one school's experience.
Tim Cook noted on the FQ3 CC (transcript) Apple has sold 13M iPads to education customers globally. The company has made a series of moves to better cater to the education market.
With demand shifting towards cheaper models, UBS estimates shipments of $300+ smartphones fell 6% Y/Y in Q2, even as total smartphone shipments rose 22%. However, Apple, which reported a 13% increase in calendar Q2 iPhone units and a 9% increase in revenue, appears to have gained ground in the segment relative to Samsung.
|Aug. 5, 2014, 10:48 PM|Apple, Samsung end patent battles outside U.S.


Following untold numbers of lawsuits, injunction requests, court petitions, and billed legal hours, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF, OTC:SSNGY) have agreed to drop all suits against each other in Germany, the U.K., Japan, Australia, the Netherlands, France, South Korea, and Italy. The deal doesn't involve any licensing agreement.
For now, the world's biggest smartphone and tablet OEMs remain at odds in the U.S., but there are signs that battle is also winding down. In June, Apple and Samsung dropped their appeals of an ITC case that led to an injunction on older Samsung phones. The prior month, a CA jury awarded Apple $120M in an infringement suit against Samsung, much less than the $2B it sought.

Apple settled its patent dispute with Motorola Mobility in May in a deal that didn't feature a cross-license, and agreed to work with Google on "some areas of patent reform."  A cross-licensing deal with HTC was struck in 2012.
|Aug. 5, 2014, 1:39 PM|Report: Apple holding iPhone event on Sep. 9


Re/code's John Paczkowski reports Apple (AAPL -0.6%) will hold an iPhone event on Tuesday, Sep. 9. That meshes with the company's historical iPhone launch schedule, as well as a 9to5 Mac report stating Apple is "tentatively" planning a mid-September iPhone 6 event.
Paczkowski has a solid track record for Apple launch event scoops. Today's report suggests (given Apple's history) the iPhone 6 could go on sale on Friday, Sep. 19.
Expectations for strong next-gen iPhone sales are particularly high this year, given pent-up demand for bigger models. In addition to 4.7" and 5.5" displays (widely reported), the rumor mill has mentioned sapphire cover glass, optical image stabilization, an NFC radio, wireless charging, and Cat-6 LTE (theoretical max speeds of 300Mbps) as potential new features.
Apple has also been reported to be negotiating iPhone 6 price hikes.

GT Advanced (NASDAQ:GTAT) now expects full-year revenue to be in the lower half of a prior $600M-$800M range (consensus is at $666.8M). But it also expects EPS to be in a range of $0.12-$0.18, the high end of a prior $0.02-$0.18 and above a $0.03 consensus. GT attributes the EPS strength to mix changes and better-than-expected gross margin.
2016 EPS guidance of $1.50 or more is reiterated. The company's Merlin and Hyperion tech platforms are expected to contribute to 2016 results.
Q2 gross margin was 25.2%, up from 8.5% in Q1 and better than expected in light of the margin pressure placed by the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) deal. GM was still down from 35% a year ago.
GT says the buildout of its Arizona facility (used to make sapphire for Apple) is "nearly complete," and that the company is starting the transition to volume production. GT received a $103M prepayment from Apple in Q2, and expects a final $139M prepayment by the end of October.
Equipment orders totaled $75M ($72M sapphire-related), up sharply from Q1's low $29M. Equipment backlog grew by $19M Q/Q to $628M ($333M sapphire, $292M polysilicon, $3M solar).

Though she previously expressed concerns about the deal, Judge Denise Cote has approved Apple's (AAPL +0.6%) $450M e-book price-fixing settlement.
The deal calls on Apple to pay $400M to consumers and $50M to lawyers if an appeals court upholds Cote's ruling on the case, and $50M and $20M if it overturns them. In today's ruling, Cote says states and consumers "strongly believe" her findings will be upheld.
If upheld, the payout will still only amount to a moderate financial hit for Apple, which had FQ3 net income of $7.7B.
Separately, with Beats now officially a part of Apple's empire, the WSJ is reporting Beats Music chief Ian Rogers will also run iTunes Radio going forward.
The paper adds Rogers will be in charge of both services to "create cohesion in Apple’s streaming-music options." One current point of non-cohesion: Beats Music is available on iOS, Android, and Windows Phone, while iTunes Radio's mobile support is limited to iOS.
Two months before the Beats deal was announced, Billboard reported Apple was mulling an Android iTunes app, and holding talks about launching a Spotify-like music streaming service; Beats Music has eliminated the need for the latter.

|Aug. 1, 2014, 11:46 AM|Apple closes Beats deal; skepticism about October iPhone 6 report


"Today we are excited to officially welcome Beats Music and Beats Electronics to the Apple (AAPL -0.1%) family," reads a message on Apple's site. A revamped version of Beats' site has launched in tandem with the announcement; its home page features a message with the title, "There's a new instrument in the Apple family."
Apple has already begun cutting overlapping jobs at Beats, which reportedly had 2013 revenue of $1.3B (likely at high margins). The acquisition of the Beats Music streaming service marks the first time Apple is offering an Android app, albeit one that doesn't feature the Apple brand for now.
Meanwhile, there's a fair amount of skepticism about a MacRumors report suggesting the iPhone 6 could go on sale on Oct. 14 (a Tuesday). The report cites an Apple Store employee who heard for a "senior Store Leader" that Oct. 14 will be an "immense" day for Apple, and that a media event is planned for Sep. 16 (also a Tuesday).

9to5 Mac notes iPhones typically go on sale on a Friday, 10 days after a Tuesday launch event. Thus, if the iPhone 6 is unveiled on Sep. 16, sales would most likely start on Friday, Sep. 26.
On the other hand, iPad launches have often happened in October, and 9to5 has previously reported Apple is planning an October event that will likely center around an iWatch/fitness band. It has also reported Apple is "tentatively" planning a mid-September iPhone 6 event.

Update: The WSJ reports Beats Music chief Ian Rogers will now also be in charge of iTunes Radio.

Prior reports suggested that the iPhone 6 would begin selling in September, although it now seems that Apple will only announce the device in September, but will begin selling the iPhone 6 on October 14.
It is still unknown if an October release for the iPhone 6 would include both the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch version.

Apple (AAPL -0.1%) has refreshed its MacBook Pro lineup to feature faster Intel Haswell CPUs, and more RAM in standard configurations. It has also cut the starting price of its most powerful 15" retina Pro model by $100 to $2499. (PR)
The $1299 and $1499 13" retina Pro models each now sport 2.6GHz. dual-core Core i5 CPUs, and the $1799 model has a 2.8GHz. variant. The $1999 and $2499 15" models respectively feature 2.2GHz. and 2.5GHz. quad-core Core i7 CPUs.
All 13" models now come with 8GB of RAM standard, and the 15" models come with 16GB. The next refresh will likely involve Intel's upcoming 14nm Broadwell CPUs.
Also: Apple has cut the starting price of its 13" non-retina MacBook Pro by $100 to $1099. That move follows the June launch of a cheaper iMac, and the April launch of cheaper MacBook Airs.
The launch of cheaper hardware had an impact in FQ3: Apple's Mac sales rose 13% Y/Y to $5.5B, and units 18% to 4.4M (better than expected). At the same time, ASP fell to $1,255 from FQ2's $1,334.

TechCrunch reports the purchase price was in the $10M-$15M range. BookLamp's technology, which is based on natural language analysis, could be used to improve iBooks' recommendation features and categorization.
Meanwhile, re/code reports Apple is close to buying talk radio/podcast app Swell for ~$30M. Swell offers personalized recommendations for content from sources including iTunes, NPR, ESPN, and BBC.
Swell would complement the music-focused iTunes Radio. It might also serve as a replacement for Apple's oft-criticized Podcasts app (1.5/5 stars in the App Store).
Tim Cook mentioned on the FQ3 CC Apple has closed 5 more acquisitions since the end of FQ2; aside from BookLamp, LuxVue and Spotsetter are the known purchases. The Beats deal is expected to close this quarter.

"With [gross margins] stabilizing and core demand trends solid, we think investors will want to own Apple (AAPL +3%) stock into bigger-screen iPhone 6 and ecosystem-expanding iWatch/iBand launches," writes Evercore, staying bullish on Apple following its mixed FQ3 results and light FQ4 guidance.
Macquarie: "The bottom line is that the iPhone 6 reception is what matters right now." Its target has been raised by $7 to $102. At least 6 other firms have also hiked their PTs today.
Citi, which recently launched coverage at Buy, expects 140M iPhone 6 sales over the first 12 months (compares with an iPhone installed base of 300M), and thinks the adoption of installment/early upgrade plans could provide further upside.
It's also pleased with Apple's 28% Greater China growth, given fears of tougher competition from local vendors - fast-growing Xiaomi just rolled out a metal-framed flagship phone that goes for $320 unsubsidized.

9to5 Mac reports today Apple is "tentatively" planning to unveil the iPhone 6 in mid-September. Sources state the 4.7" model is set to be shown off, but add a final decision hasn't been made on revealing the 5.5" model at the event. KGI reported last week the 5.5" model could be delayed due to production issues.
The site also reports Apple is planning an October event that will likely involve an iWatch/fitness band. Apple is fresh off receiving a patent for a modular smartwatch design that includes a strap with built-in sensors and other circuitry.

FQ3 iPad (NASDAQ:AAPL) sales were hurt by channel inventory cuts, Tim Cook states on the CC. He adds emerging markets tablet demand is holding up better than U.S. demand - PC sales have been rebounding in the latter - and that Apple is counting on its IBM partnership to boost business iPad sales; U.S. business penetration is pegged at 20%.
Over half of all iPad buyers are still first-time buyers - that points to both growing penetration and relatively low upgrade rates. The tablet market's growth has slowed considerably in recent quarters.
CFO Luca Maestri states cost improvements contributed to the FQ3 gross margin beat; a mix shift towards iPhones (have higher margins than iPads) also didn't hurt. He hints new products are partly responsible for the conservative FQ4 margin guidance.
Also mentioned: 1) Apple has bought 5 more companies since the end of FQ2. 2) The cash balance rose $13.9B Q/Q to $164.5B; 84% of it is offshore. 3) NAND flash, mobile DRAM, and LCD prices fell in FQ3, while PC DRAM prices rose. 4) iTunes revenue rose 8% to $2.6B.
With iPhone mix shifting towards emerging markets, iPhone ASP fell to $561 from $596 in FQ2 and $637 in FQ1; Cook suggests 5C sales were strong. iPad ASP was $443 vs. $465 in FQ2 and $440 in FQ1. Mac ASP fell to $1,255 vs. $1,334 in FQ2 and $1,322 in FQ1.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has placed orders for 70M-80M 4.7" and 5.5" iPhone 6 units to be manufactured by Dec. 30, the WSJ reports. That's a sizable increase from the 50M-60M iPhone 5S/5C units Apple initially ordered last year.
Orders can change significantly based on consumer demand - for example, iPhone 5C orders were slashed, and 5S orders increased, following last year's launches. But the report still suggests Cupertino expects strong pent-up demandfor bigger iPhones. If accurate, it's a positive for Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS).
A Taiwanese paper reported two weeks ago Apple had already put in orders for 68M iPhone 6 units. Prior to that, a report stated Foxconn is hiring 100K workers to help with iPhone 6 production.
The WSJ's report comes ahead of Tuesday's FQ3 report. With shares up 26% since the FQ2 report, expectations have risen a bit. UBS just hiked its Apple target by $15 to $115, and raised its FQ3 estimates above consensus on data pointing to a mix shift towards the 5S and iPad Air.
The firm is cautious about FQ4, noting checks point to possible iPhone 6 supply constraints for display-related components (previous: I, II). But it's also upbeat about FY15 margin gains, as capex growth slows and the impact of a 2013 revenue deferral policy change fades.
On average, analysts polled by Fortune expect 35.9M FQ3 iPhone sales, 14.4M iPad sales, and 3.9M Mac sales.

Should an appeals court fail to rule in its favor, Apple (AAPL -0.5%) has agreed to pay $450M to settle its long-running e-book price-fixing probe, with $400M going to consumers. A successful appeal could lower the sum to $70M ($50M for consumers), or clear Apple of any payments.
Five publishers have already agreed to pay a combined $166M to settle price-fixing allegations. Today's disclosure comes after state attorneys general and consumers filed an $840M suit against Apple in February over its e-book deals, and an injunction was placed last September restricting the types of e-book deals Apple can make.
Apple's settlement was originally announced in June, but terms were confidential until now. E-books make up only a small fraction of Apple's iTunes/Software/Services revenue (totaled $4.6B in FQ2).
Separately, Citi's Jim Suva has launched coverage with a Buy and $110 PT.

The Apple (AAPL +1.2%)/IBM (IBM +2.4%) deal is a "landmark agreement," that gives Apple "enterprise capabilities and credibility at one stroke," says Forrester's Frank Gillett. He notes that while the BYOD trend has bolstered Apple's enterprise presence, the company has until now "resisted servicing enterprises" out of fear of hurting its user experience.
Endpoint Technologies' Roger Kay: "What [the deal] allows Apple to do is not change its philosophy and lay off to IBM the whole issue of, how do you make iPhones work for IT managers who actually want to be treated like a valued customer."

Tim Cook: "We’re good at building a simple experience and in building devices ... The kind of deep industry expertise you would need to really transform the enterprise isn’t in our DNA. But it is in IBM’s." He also highlights the value of IBM's 100K+ consultants/sales workers.

RBC and Canaccord both think iPhone sales could get a boost; the former is also upbeat about the premium AppleCare service that will be developed. Baird thinks the deal "could help AAPL cement iOS as the preferred platform for enterprise."
Piper's Gene Munster, however, doesn't see a huge hardware impact. "We note that if half of the Fortune 500 were to each purchase an incremental 2,000 iPhones and 1,000 iPads above what they were planning to purchase ... it would mean about a half a percent to CY15 revenue." He also expects IBM to eventually offer similar Android solutions.
The deal strengthens IBM's MobileFirst initiative, through which Big Blue is already offering a variety of enterprise mobile apps/services. An IBM exec: "We wanted to focus on creating an absolutely irresistible workflow and processes and a design of apps that can be used by every user."
|Jul. 15, 2014, 4:50 PM|Apple, IBM in far-reaching enterprise partnership

 As part of a comprehensive enterprise mobility partnership, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and IBM plan to develop 100+ "industry-specific enterprise solutions," including new iPhone/iPad apps. The apps will begin to arrive this fall, and IBM will resell iPhones/iPads containing them to clients worldwide. The companies also plan to develop IBM cloud services optimized for iOS. Targeted markets include security, mobile device management (MDM), and big data/analytics. New enterprise-focused AppleCare services will be offered, as will "new packaged offerings from IBM for device activation, supply and management." Apple, which maintains an outsized share of enterprise mobile hardware activations, has tried hard to grow its business footprint during the Tim Cook era. Aside from any value provided by the new apps/services, Big Blue's credibility and relationships with Global 2000 firms should provide a shot in the arm for Apple's efforts. As for IBM, the deal adds to a mobile software/services push that has already resulted in a string of acquisitions and product launches. 
AAPL +1.4% AH. IBM +2%. BlackBerry (NASDAQ:BBRY) -3.2%, as investors worry about the MDM portion of the alliance. MobileIron (NASDAQ:MOBL) could also be affected by it.

Update: Tim Cook, discussing the deal with re/code: "We’re good at building a simple experience and in building devices ... The kind of deep industry expertise you would need to really transform the enterprise isn’t in our DNA. But it is in IBM’s." |Jul. 14, 2014, 1:16 PM|CLSA slashes GT Advanced forecasts on low sapphire yields


While GT Advanced (GTAT -5.3%) now has 2K+ sapphire furnaces installed in Arizona for iPhone cover glass production, its yields could be soft due to "poor quality alumina" (the raw material used for sapphire boules) and "immature process yields," writes CLSA's Mark Heller.
Heller thinks GT and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may have tried to use alumina from "a cheaper, less reliable supplier in China," and that GT is now trying to secure higher-quality material. He also reports iWatch sapphire production is being handled by Asian suppliers.
His 2014 revenue and EPS forecasts have respectively been cut to $500M and -$0.30, well below a consensus of $686.8M and $0.07.
Shares are now down 26% from a July 2 high of $20.54, thanks in large part to two downgrades on July 7. They go for 1.7x 2015E sales.

|Jul. 14, 2014, 9:35 AM|Apple catches Barclays upgrade; KGI sees 5.5" iPhone delay


"We believe Tim Cook has solidified his strategy and re-gained the confidence of Apple (AAPL +0.8%) stakeholders in many ways - reversing many of the warning signs we saw earlier in the year," writes Barclays' Ben Reitzes, upgrading shares to Overweight and hiking his PT by $15 to $110.
Reitzes, who downgraded Apple in February following many years of being bullish, also thinks Samsung's recent issues provide a buffer, and that checks for new products (in terms of build orders, demand, and quality) are strong.
He respectively forecasts FY14 and FY15 EPS of $6.36 and $7.10, above consensus estimates of $6.32 and $6.93, and expects 61.5M iPhones to be sold in the Dec. quarter.
Separately, KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo reports the 5.5" iPhone 6 could be delayed due to production issues related to "the yield rate of in-cell touch [panels] and color unevenness of metal casing." He also isn't sure if the 5.5" model's sapphire cover glass will "easily pass the drop test near-term."
Kuo thinks the phone's launch is likely to happen after October, and possibly not until 2015. As previously noted, he has a mixed track record for predicting product launch dates, and a better one for predicting product specs.
GT Advanced (NASDAQ:GTAT) is down 5.4% thanks to Kuo's sapphire remarks.
|Jul. 11, 2014, 2:45 PM|Apple roundup: iWatch, Chinese media, iPhone sales


Citing production challenges, KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo now thinks the start of iWatch (AAPL +0.1%) mass-production won't happen until mid/late-November. He forecasts just 3M 2014 shipments.
Kuo also backs up past reports stating the iWatch will sport sapphire cover glass and a flexible OLED display, and adds the device will be waterproof. As 9to5 Mac notes, Kuo has a mixed track record for predicting product launch dates, but has a better record when it comes to predicting product specs.
Reuters reported in June the iWatch will enter mass-production in July. The WSJ followed up by reporting two models are on tap, and that they'll have "more than 10 sensors to track and monitor health and fitness data." The paper suggested mass-production would start in the Aug./Sep. timeframe.
China's state-owned CCTV has called the iPhone a threat to national security due to the ability of its Frequent Locations feature to track users. The criticism comes amid NSA-related tensions, and shortly after the Chinese government ordered local carriers to slash their subsidies for the iPhone and other high-end devices.
Last year, Chinese media and a government agency criticized Apple for its repair/warranty policies. The criticism ended after Tim Cook issued an apology and announced policy changes.
Ahead of Apple's July 22 FQ3 report, Canaccord's Mike Walkley has upped his PT by $10 to $112, and respectively hiked his FY14 and FY15 iPhone sales forecasts by 4M and 10M to 170M and 197M.
Though believing near-term iPhone sales have been hurt by iPhone 6 anticipation, Walkley is very upbeat about pent-up demand for bigger iPhones. He now sees Apple's iPhone ASP rising $51 in FY15 to $652.
|Jul. 10, 2014, 6:05 PM|Apple roundup: iPhone 6 orders, U.S. Mac sales, Apple TV, TSMC


Taiwan's Business Weekly reports Apple (AAPL -0.4%) has already put in orders for 68M iPhone 6 units. The report follows a May Morgan Stanley note indicating iPhone 6 orders are up 20% relative to 5S orders.
Cirrus Logic (CRUS -1.1%) would benefit from strong iPhone build activity. Orders, of course, can end up being drastically increased or pared back due to end-user demand.

IDC estimates U.S. Mac unit shipments fell 1.7% Y/Y in Q2 to 1.68M. With the U.S. PC market growing 6.9%, Apple's share fell 90 bps to 10% (#4 overall). Revenue share is doubtlessly higher.

Parks Associates estimates Roku accounted for 46% of 2013 U.S streaming set-top (non-pay-TV) sales, and Apple TV 26%. A survey of U.S. broadband households with at least one such set-top found 44% used a Roku box the most, and 26% used Apple TV the most.

The WSJ backs up several other reports (previous) stating TSMC (TSM +2.3%) has begun producing an Apple CPU (likely the A8) using the foundry's cutting-edge 20nm process. More interestingly, the paper reports Apple and TSMC have begun work on testing CPUs to be made using a 16nm process.
TSMC plans to launch a 16nm process (called FinFET+) next year that delivers major performance/power efficiency gains relative to its 20nm process. Digitimes has reported TSMC is working on a version of FinFET+ "tailored to Apple's requirements," as part of its efforts to manufacture Apple's A9 CPU.
Nonetheless, Samsung is still expected to land a portion of Apple's A9 orders, possibly with the help of its upcoming 14nm FinFET process.

|Jul. 8, 2014, 12:16 PM|Chinese government calls for phone subsidy cuts; UBS sees iPhone impact


The Chinese government has told China Mobile (CHL -0.4%), China Unicom (CHU +1.3%), and China Telecom (CHA -0.3%) to slash phone subsidies and advertising by a combined RMB40B ($6.4B) in 3 years, Bloomberg reports.
The government came to its decision after concluding carriers are spending too much to promote the iPhone (AAPL -1.8%) and other high-end hardware. While a large chunk of Chinese phone sales are unsubsidized, subsidies have been growing as carriers try to sign up higher-income subs to 3G/4G postpaid plans.
A possible motivation: Apple and Samsung control much of the high-end Chinese phone market, while local firms (both OEM and white-label) control much of the mid-range and low-end.
China Mobile, which began selling the iPhone in January, has forecast its subsidy spend will rise 29% in 2014 to RMB29B ($4.7B). China Telecom says it has already been "implementing stringent control on [its] selling expenses to ensure operating profitability.”
UBS, generally upbeat about Apple this year, thinks subsidy cuts and Samsung price cuts could slow Apple's Chinese momentum. The company's Greater China sales rose 13% Y/Y in FQ2 to $9.3B.
The Bloomberg report comes as Samsung says it expects to report soft Q2 smartphone/tablet sales. Among other things, the company blames tough low-end/mid-range phone competition, and weak tablet market demand caused by phablet cannibalization and low upgrade rates. CIRP has observed iPad upgrade cycles are notably longer than iPhone upgrade cycles.
|Jul. 7, 2014, 4:43 PM|Apple roundup: Board additions, iPhone battery, sapphire


Tim Cook is "actively seeking new directors" for Apple's (AAPL +2.1%) board, the WSJ reports. The paper notes the 8-person board currently has 6 directors aged 63 or older, and is "known for its loyalty" to Steve Jobs.
The WSJ also highlights the differences between Cook and Jobs' management styles - One ex-employee: "The only thing that Steve cared about was creating great products ... Tim is much more worried about everything at the company." - and recent moves that point to strategy shifts, such as allowing Beats to keep its brand and significantly expanding what developers are allowed to do with iOS/Mac OS.
It also airs concerns among current/former employees Apple is spreading itself too thin. "It was Steve's job to say no," says one of them. "Tim is not as comfortable doing that."
Chinese site IT168 reports the 4.7" and 5.5" iPhone 6 models will respectively have 1800mAh and 2,500mAh batteries - considerably larger than the iPhone 5S' 1560mAh battery - thanks to their extra real estate.
Larger batteries are generally the norm for bigger phones - the Galaxy S5 has a 2800mAH battery. The report comes as Google gets set to roll out Android L, which promises a big improvement in Android's oft-criticized battery life.
Sonny Dickson has leaked a video said to show a 4.7" iPhone 6 front panel sporting sapphire cover glass. GT Advanced (GTAT) has been busy ramping sapphire production for Apple this year. A June report from the hit-and-miss Economic Daily News stated only the 5.5" iPhone 6 will have sapphire cover glass, due to production limits.
|Jul. 1, 2014, 11:53 AM|Apple roundup: Voice recognition, iPhone 6, PT hikes



Wired reports Apple (AAPL +1%), which thus far has been relying on Nuance's (NUAN -2.2%) voice recognition tech to help power Siri, has built its own voice recognition research team. Former Microsoft research director Alex Acero is part of the team, as are ex-Nuance researchers.
The magazine adds Apple is looking to use neural networking algorithms to improve voice recognition; Google and Microsoft have also shown an interest in the technology. Nuance is selling off on the report.
Sonny Dickson (leaked iPhone 5S pictures last year) has leaked images said to show the 4.7" iPhone 6's screen covers. The edges of the covers (but not the area covering the display) are slightly curved.
Baird and BTIG have joined the parade of analysts to hike their Apple PTs. Baird (PT hiked by $7 to $102) cites optimism about iPhone demand and pending product refreshes.

With the help of a strong Galaxy S5 launch and healthy low-end phone demand, Android's (GOOG) U.S., Chinese, EU5, and Japanese shares respectively rose to 61.9% (+990 bps Y/Y), 82.7% (+1130 bps), 73.3% (+150 bps), and 47% (+50 bps) during the March-May timeframe, says Kantar Worldpanel. (PR - .pdf)
Results were mixed for the iPhone (AAPL) ahead of the expected fall launch of 4.7" and 5.5" iPhone 6 models: U.S. and Chinese shares respectively fell to 32.5% (-940 bps Y/Y) and 14.7% (-910 bps), but EU5 and Japanese shares rose to 16.6% (+80 bps) and 51.7% (+210 bps). With March quarter iPhone ASP at $596, revenue shares are bound to be higher.
More evidence large screens are a bigger selling point in Europe (among other places): 17% of European Galaxy S5 buyers said they switched from Apple, while only 8% of U.S. buyers said the same. 58% of European S5 buyers already owned a Samsung (SSNLF, SSNGY) phone.
|Jun. 26, 2014, 7:12 PM|Apple roundup: Smart home hardware, iPod Touch, Costco



9to5 Mac (the source of plenty of Apple scoops) reports Apple (AAPL) has "assembled a team to work on various hardware products for the home" that integrate with its existing hardware.
Details are scant on the products being eyed, but sources do state Apple is likely building "advanced speaker systems or control panels for homes," and that it probably won't compete against Google's Nest Labs unit (run by ex-iPod chief Tony Fadell) in the smart thermostat and smoke detector markets.
Apple is 3 weeks removed from showing off its HomeKit platform, replete with Siri integration and a long list of hardware and chip partners. Last week, Google/Nest announced it's buying Wi-Fi monitoring camera upstart Dropcam for $555M.
Apple has replaced the 16GB $229 iPod Touch (has no rear camera) in its lineup with a $199 16GB model that features a rear camera and more color options. In addition, the 32GB and 64GB models (feature rear cameras) now go for $249 and $299, down from a prior $299 and $399.
Smartphone cannibalization led Apple's iPod revenue to fall 53% Y/Y in FQ2 to $461M. Unit shipments totaled 2.8M.
Following a 1 1/2-year hiatus, Costco is once more selling Apple hardware ... and with sizable discounts. The 16GB iPhone 5S is offered on the Costco Mobile site for a subsidized $78, and 4G versions of the iPad Air and retina Mini (for Verizon's network) are $100 off normal retail prices.

Taiwan's Economic Daily News reports Foxconn is in the midst of hiring 100K workers to help ramp iPhone 6 (AAPL -0.1%) production. Fellow ODM Pegatron is also said to be ramping iPhone-related hiring.
Foxconn is said to be handling 70% of production for the iPhone 6, which is expected to tap into pent-up demand for bigger iPhones. Apple is reportedly trying to get carriers to agree to a price hike. Cirrus Logic (CRUS +2.8%) has closed higher following the report.

China Times reports TSMC (TSM -1.4%) is expected to produce 120M Touch ID fingerprint sensors this year, up over 3x from last year. Next-gen iPad models are expected to support Touch ID, which was just opened up to iOS developers.
Following an Asian trip, Pac Crest believes the 5.5" iPhone 6 will support optical image stabilization (OIS). The firm also backs up VentureBeat by expressing confidence the iPhone 6 will support wireless charging and NFC.
Sony, LG, and Nokia have included OIS in high-end smartphone models, and Samsung is expected to do so in upcoming phones. Pac Crest's report follows the release of API data suggesting iOS 8 supports manual camera controls.

Update: Bloomberg reports iPhone 6 mass-production will start in July, and that both the 4.7" and 5.5" models might arrive in September.

Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are adding a "kill switch" to their next smartphone operating systems, following Apple's (AAPL) release of the feature last September.
Apple's kill switch function prompts users to enter their Apple ID and password before erasing data, turning off "Find my iPhone", or reactivating the device.
Since the feature has been added, iPhone thefts have plummeted. New York displayed a 19% decrease in robberies for the first five months of 2014, compared to the same period last year. San Francisco robberies have dropped 38%.
|Jun. 19, 2014, 3:51 PM|Reuters: iWatch likely to have 2.5" display, enter production in July


Contract manufacturer Quanta will start iWatch (AAPL -0.4%) mass production in July ahead of a launch that could "come as early as October," Reuters reports, citing sources. That fits well with past reports from the Nikkei and re/code.
Reuters adds the device will likely have a 2.5" touch display - LG Display (LPL +2.3%) is said to be the exclusive supplier - to go with a pulse monitor (should work with iOS 8's Health app) and wireless charging support. The watch face "will protrude slightly from the band, creating an arched shape."
Apple reportedly expects 50M shipments in the first year of availability; the consumer response could ultimately yield a very different shipment level. For reference, Apple sold 148M iPhones in FY13, and might sell 180M+ in FY14.

Update: The WSJ reports the iWatch will likely arrive in two screen sizes, and feature over 10 sensors.

A new 21.5" entry-level iMac (AAPL) starts at just $1099 - $200 less than what the cheapest model for Apple's all-in-one desktop line previously went for.
The catch: Whereas the $1299 model features a quad-core, 2.7GHz, Intel Core i5 CPU (Turbo Boost to 3.2GHz.), the $1099 model sports a dual-core, 1.4GHz., i5 CPU (Turbo Boost to 2.7GHz.). It also has a smaller hard drive (500GB vs. 1TB), and less powerful integrated graphics (Intel HD 5000 vs. Iris Pro).
In April, Apple launched MacBook Airs that (in addition to having slightly faster CPUs) were $100 cheaper than comparable prior-gen units. The entry-level Air now goes for $899.
Apple's Mac revenue was up 1% Y/Y in FQ2 on the back of 5% unit growth. Mac ASP was $1339 - far above the PC industry average.

The lawsuit was connected to a case filed by the Justice Department in April 2012 that charged Apple and five American book publishers of conspiring to fix e-book prices and attempting to break Amazon's hold on the market with its Kindle. The terms of the settlement, which still needs court approval, have not been disclosed. |Jun. 10, 2014, 7:18 PM|Reports: Apple facing EU tax probe, building huge ad team


Irish broadcaster RTE reports the EU will launch a formal investigation of Apple's (AAPL +0.6%) Irish tax arrangements.
Apple's use of favorable Irish tax laws allowed it to pay just a 3.7% tax rate on non-U.S. income during its last fiscal year. That, in turn, is a big reason $132.2B of Apple's $150.6B  cash balance at the end of FQ2 was offshore.
Tim Cook was grilled by Congress last year over Apple's offshore tax payments; Cook responded in part by calling for an overhaul of the oft-criticized U.S. corporate tax code.
Meanwhile, AdAge reports Apple is "madly building an internal [ad] agency that it's telling recruits will eventually number 1,000 [employees]," and by doing so is set to move projects away from historical agency partner TBWA/MAL.
Apple has also reportedly invited other agencies to collaborate on big projects, as it tries to overhaul its marketing after recent campaigns failed to meet expectations.
In e-mails unearthed during the latest Samsung trial, marketing chief Phil Schiller voiced concerns about Samsung's ad campaigns, and also asked Cook if Apple should replace TBWA/MAL.

39M iPhones (AAPL +0.1%) will be sold in the June quarter, better than a 35M consensus, according to Morgan Stanley's AlphaWise tracker.
The MS forecast implies 25% Y/Y unit growth, better than FQ2's 17%. Analyst Katy Huberty thinks strong promotional activity for cheaper iPhones (pressuring ASPs, but boosting units) is helping.
Though AlphaWise's methodology lends itself to criticism - per MS, it "compiles sell-through data using Web search analysis" - its track record is solid. It forecast 40.6M FQ2 iPhone sales vs. actual sales of 43.7M and a 38M consensus, and 50.5M FQ1 iPhone sales vs. actual sales of 51M and a 53M consensus.
The MS report comes shortly after BlueFin Research reported checks point to healthy iPhone/iPad build activity ahead of fall refreshes.

An NFC radio would likely help enable Apple's rumored mobile payments service. Top NFC chipmaker NXP (NXPI) must be pleased to see the report, which comes as Chinese carriers get set to adopt NFC on a large scale.
TechCrunch reports Apple has bought Spotsetter, developer of a local search app that relied on social media info, reviews, and other data to recommend local businesses over a map-based UI.
The purchase meshes with Apple's growing mapping/search investments. It bought Twitter search engine Topsy last December, and this week showed off a big overhaul for its Spotlight search tool.
Brian White's Apple Monitor (tracks the sales of Apple-dependent Taiwanese suppliers) is up 6%-7% M/M in May, much better than a 9-year average of 2%. White sees the Apple Monitor rising 18%-20% Q/Q for the whole of Q2, ahead of the iPhone 6 launch.

 The Nikkei reports the iWatch (AAPL +0.2%) is expected to arrive in October, and (per a parts supplier) will see initial production of 3M-5M units/month. In-line with past rumors, the device is said to feature a curved OLED display and health sensors that monitor data such as "calorie consumption, sleep activity, blood glucose and blood oxygen levels." Apple is only 4 days removed from unveiling its HealthKit platform, which (together with an iOS Health app) aims to give an integrated view of health/fitness data from hardware sensors and 3rd-party apps/services. Samsung integrated several health sensors into the Galaxy S5, and Google has made health monitoring a key part of its new Android Wear platform.
Citing talks with current/former Apple employees, BuzzFeed reports the iTunes team was "plagued by shortsighted management" that ignored competitors, ahead of the Beats deal. Some managers reportedly refused to "open or use Spotify," and some didn't know it was an on-demand streaming service (rather than a radio service). Others referred to Pandora as a "dead company."
A 9to5 Mac report stating Apple has submitted a spec to enable headphones featuring Lightning (rather than 3.5mm) connectors has fueled speculation future Beats headphones will support Lightning.
In addition to potentially improving audio quality for high-end headphones, a Lightning connector could allow users to control/launch apps via their headphones, and to charge an iDevice using an external battery.

Update: Re/code also reports Apple is aiming for an October iWatch launch. |Jun. 3, 2014, 11:11 AM|Apple's Spotlight search dumps Google in favor of Bing


Along with announcing a major revamp of iOS and Mac OS X's Spotlight search tool - integrated local/Web search, location-specific results, and more content-specific search options are some of the new features, Apple (AAPL +1.2%) has quietly disclosed it's dropping Google (GOOG -1.5%) as Spotlight's Web search provider in favor of Bing (MSFT -1%).
Importantly, Google remains the default search provider for Safari, which in turn acts as the default iOS/Mac OS browser. But the Spotlight switch is still a noteworthy loss for Google, given the feature's tight integration with Apple's platforms - an iOS user only has to swipe down from his/her home screen to access Spotlight, and a new search box will provide quick access for Mac OS users.
As for Bing, the deal provides a needed mobile win for a search engine estimated by StatCounter to have just a 5.48% global mobile/tablet search share as of May - 1.77% for Bing proper, 3.71% for Yahoo - to Google's 93.5%. Bing replaced Google as Siri's search engine last year.
Separately, Apple has added DuckDuckGo as a Safari search option (along with Google, Bing, and Yahoo). DuckDuckGo tries to differentiate itself by emphasizing its privacy and security features - among other things, it doesn't store IP addresses or log user info.

Apple's (AAPL -1.2%) reported home automation platform has been unveiled. Called HomeKit, the platform acts as "a common network protocol" for 3rd-party hardware/chips that can be managed by iDevices - initial supporters include Broadcom, Cree, TI, Philips, Honeywell, and Haier.
HomeKit also integrates with Siri - saying "Get ready for bed" can result in a connected house automatically locking its doors and dimming its lights.
Apple promises iOS 8 will deliver major GPU performance enhancements, such as a 10x increase in draw-call rates. Electronic Arts (EA -1.9%) is bringing its powerful Frostbite engine to the platform.
For the first time, iOS will support 3rd-party keyboards. Swype owner Nuance (NUAN) has ticked slightly higher in response. The OS will also add support for inter-app communications, a feature long requested by developers.
Also: 1) Siri now has a Google Now-like always-on mode. Saying "Hey, Siri" activates the service. 2) The Touch ID fingerprint sensor has been opened up to 3rd-party apps. 3) Like Yosemite, iOS 8 supports 3rd-party Notification Center widgets.
As expected, iOS 8 will launch to consumers in the fall (likely in tandem with the iPhone 6).

Apple (AAPL -0.6%) kicks off WWDC by revealing Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite). As rumored, 10.10 features an iOS 7/Jony Ive-influenced design overhaul that includes translucent effects, new icons, and a generally "flatter" UI. Apple has also thrown in a "dark mode" for pro users.
Other new features include: 1) An updated Notification Center with an iOS-like "Today" view and the ability to (via the App Store) add widgets. 2) A Spotlight search revamp that includes integrated local/Web search and the use of location data. 3) A new version of Safari that delivers better performance and lowers power draw.
A cloud storage/file-syncing solution called iCloud Drive has been launched. Like Dropbox, SkyDrive, and other existing solutions, iCloud Drive creates a local folder that syncs with other devices, and with a cloud drive. Notably, it supports both Mac and Windows hardware.
Also launched: Handoff, a feature that allows users to move tasks between iOS and Mac OS devices with a mere swipe. An e-mail being written on a phone can be quickly moved to a Mac, and SMS chats and phone calls can also be transferred. The AirDrop file-sharing service now works between iOS and Mac OS gear.
The Mac installed base is now above 80M. 40M+ copies of OS X  Mavericks have been installed since the update arrived last year.

Apple (AAPL) will reveal more iBeacon technology at the World Wide Developers Conference in San Francisco starting today.
Virgin Atlantic has already installed beacons in London's Heathrow Airport so a smartphone automatically displays a boarding pass when the passenger comes to the gate or security. LabWerk has also produced an app to alert drivers of empty spots in parking garages based on the beacons.
Mobile devices receive the low-power Bluetooth signal within 500ft of a beacon. The transmitter price is now between $5 and $20, but is expected to fall to less than $2 next year.
Apple has also addressed iBeacon privacy concerns, saying the beacons don't track users, since they only send out a signal, and don't receive information.

Apple's (AAPL +1.2%) investments in "platform enhancements such as mobile payments, connected home solutions, and personal health monitors should be far more important for driving switching costs and installed base expansion" than hardware improvements, writes Goldman's Bill Shope, raising his PT by $85 to $720.
The remarks come ahead of next week's WWDC conference, where Apple is expected to show off iOS 8 (inc. a Healthbook app), a home automation platform, and OS X 10.10 (Syrah).
Shares are again making new 52-week highs, and are now up 16% YTD. They're still 9% below a Sep. '12 peak of $705.07.

Beats Music will continue supporting Android and Windows Phone post-acquisition, says Tim Cook (AAPL +1.5%). Though not a total surprise, the remarks represent the first time Apple has committed to offering apps for 3rd-party mobile platforms.
Meanwhile, during a Code Conference talk also featuring Jimmy Iovine (live blog), Eddy Cue states Beats Music, launched only in January and trumpeted by Apple far more over the last 24 hours than Beats' headphones, now has 250K subs (via 5M downloads) - far more than the 111K it reportedly had as of March. Market leader Spotify recently topped 10M paid subs.
Cue adds iTunes has surpassed 35B cumulative song purchases (up from 25B in Feb. '13), and that iTunes Radio now has 40M listeners; Pandora (P +0.1%) had 76M active listeners at the end of April.
He also proclaims Apple has "the best product pipeline that I’ve seen in my 25 years at Apple," and reiterates his dislike of the current TV-viewing experience. "All we have today is glorified VCRs ... You have a bunch of disparate systems. There's no standards."
Shares are making fresh 52-week highs, aided by PT hikes from UBS, Baird, and Piper. UBS sees U.S. survey data about iPhone contract lengths pointing to a huge iPhone 6 upgrade cycle.

"The ugly truth is that there is such a Berlin Wall between Silicon Valley and L.A. ... The two don't respect each other, don't understand each other," says Tim Cook. He's hoping new employees Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre will act as a bridge.
The WSJ states Iovine and Dre will "work with both Apple's (AAPL) electronics and music-streaming divisions, spending as much time at [Apple HQ] as necessary." In an employee memo, Cook says the Beats team will report to Internet services chief Eddy Cue.
Cook offers high praise for Beats Music, which pairs an algorithm with human curation. "We love the subscription service that they built—we think it's the first one that really got it right." He suggests in his memo the service will be integrated with iTunes.
In an interview, Cook refers to Beats' headphone ops as "a reasonable-size business that’s fast-growing." He also predicts the deal will be accretive to FY15 (ends Sep. '15) EPS.
IFPI estimates global music streaming/subscription sales rose 51% Y/Y in 2013, and that download sales (still 2/3 of all revenue) fell 2%. Back in March, Apple was reported to be mulling a subscription music service, and thinking of offering an Android iTunes app.
Pandora (P), which fell when the first Apple/Beats reports arrived, is down 1% AH.

Apple (AAPL) is expected to announce it's acquiring Beats Electronics this week, but has cut the acquisition price by $200M to $3B, the NY Post reports.
The Post states the fact Beats Music had only 111K subs as of March may have affected the deal's price. "Apple hadn’t even begun its due diligence process when news of the number came out."

Billboard reported a few days ago attempts to negotiate a price for Beats Music (not fully owned by Beats Electronics) was one of the factors slowing down buyout talks, and that Apple was "nowhere near ready" to have the talks leaked to the media when they were.
The paper also reports Beats, which likely reaps high margins on sales of its pricey headphones and speakers, had 2013 revenue of $1.3B - that suggests Apple is paying just 2.3x sales.

The FT reports Apple (AAPL) plans to show off a software platform that would "turn the iPhone into a remote control for lights, security systems and other household appliances" at its June 2-6 WWDC conference. Apple's home automation solution will reportedly work with Apple TV (in addition to the iPhone/iPad), and do things such as allow a home’s lights to "automatically come on when the owner enters the house, using their iPhone to wirelessly signal their arrival." The company is said to be talking with OEMs to certify their products.
The report follows Google's $3.2B deal to buy smart thermostat/smoke detector maker Nest Labs, which was founded by iPod "godfather" Tony Fadell and features many other ex-Apple engineers/designers. Last year, Microsoft bought home automation startup R2 Studios, reportedly beating out Apple and Google along the way.
As it is, Apple has launched, or is reported to be launching, a slew of platforms meant to allow iDevices to connect/interact with 3rd-party hardware. Others include CarPlay, iBeacon, and a (rumored) mobile payments service. The company is also expected to launch (via iOS 8) a Healthbook app that will interact with various health sensors, and possibly an iWatch.

Apple (AAPL) is seeking a sales ban on nine older models of Samsung (SSNLF) phones after it won a lawsuit which found that the South Korean company infringed on three patents.
Although Apple won $120M of the $2.2B it sought in the case, the tech giant argues that a ban would be more important than monetary damages.
While Apple also infringed one Samsung patent, the latter has yet to pursue a ban on Apple products.
Meanwhile, Apple, along with Adobe (ADBE), Intel (INTC) and Google (GOOG), has confirmed a report that they have agreed to pay $324M to settle claims they limited competition by conspiring not to hire each others' workers.

Apple (AAPL) "nearly imploded with outrage" when it caught wind of a video featuring (colorful) remarks from Dr. Dre that appeared to confirm Apple is acquiring Beats, Billboard reports.

Billboard, which has plenty of music industry sources, still hears a deal is happening, but also reports hearing various issues have slowed down the process, with the video being one of them.
Others include: 1) The sheer size of the deal - Apple is used to buying smaller companies. 2) Concerns about how Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine will fit; Apple reportedly isn't sure if they should be consultants or full-time employees. 3) Negotiating a price for the Beats Music streaming service, which is only partly owned by Beats Electronics.
The magazine also states (citing a source "in and around" the talks) Apple was "nowhere near ready" to have media reports of the deal break when they did.

 Apple (AAPL +0.4%) shares are up a bit in the early going after a couple of positive notes from the Street. Needham’s Charlie Wolf reiterates a Buy rating, writing that the surprising strength of iPhone 4S sales in Q1 challenges the conventional wisdom that Apple has to build a low-end phone to retain share in the smartphone market. The 4S success proves "iPhone’s brand is so strong, a two-generation-old iPhone despite its premium price holds great appeal,” which “confirms Apple’s ongoing commitment to building the aspirational brand." Analysts at Monness Crespit reiterate a Buy rating and raise their price target to $650 from $605, believing investors want to be long the name going into the debut of a larger-screen iPhone this year. |May 12, 2014, 3:37 PM|Apple reportedly drawn to Beats' streaming service; sell-side has its doubts



Bloomberg reports Apple (AAPL +1.3%) became interested in Beats after trying out its subscription streaming service, which has won praise for its personalization tech - it combines human curation with recommendation algorithms, and takes a user's mood/environment into account. The news service adds Apple plans to work with Beats to "improve the quality" of its  headphones, which have a loyal following but also plenty of audiophile  critics.

Billboard and the WSJ report Dr. Dre is set to join Jimmy Iovine (previous) as an Apple employee once the Beats deal goes down. Billboard adds the Beats co-founders could take the stage at Apple's June 2-6 WWDC developer conference.
Many on the sell-side aren't thrilled with the Beats reports. Uber-bull Gene Munster: "We are struggling to see the rationale behind this move. Beats would of course bring a world class brand in music to Apple, but Apple already has a world class brand." He speculates Apple's biggest motivation is adding Iovine to its ranks.
UBS' Steve Milunovich offers a more positive take: He thinks Apple might be paying less than 3x sales for a high-margin brand, and sees Beats' offerings strengthening Apple's streaming and wearables efforts. Milunovich also sees "philosophical compatibility" between Apple and Iovine.
BTIG's Walter Piecyk isn't a fan, but isn't too worried either. "$3 billion is less than 2% of the company’s cash and less than 10% its annual free cash flow ... we are more interested in further exploring our belief that rising upgrade rates in the [U.S.] could provide a nice tailwind for Apple in [2H14]."

There have been plenty of reports stating Apple plans to launch 4.7" and 5.5" iPhones, with some adding the latter will arrive later than the former. There have also been reports stating Apple is looking to charge a premium for a bigger iPhone. The Street has been enthusiastic about the potential of the phones to win back share lost to large-screen Android devices.

In a Facebook video posted by actor Tyrese Gibson, Beats co-founder Dr. Dre appears to confirm (with colorful language) his company is getting bought by Apple (AAPL) for a large sum.
Separately, the NY Post reports Beats' other co-founder, music industry legend Jimmy Iovine, is in talks to join Apple as a creative "special adviser" to Tim Cook.

Questions are flying about Apple's intentions for Beats, and whether the deal represents a big strategy change. While Apple has bought plenty of component, software, and services firms over the years, it has shied away from acquiring established electronics hardware brands in favor of a do-it-yourself approach. Also, audiophiles generally aren't huge fans of Beats' headphones.
At the same time, Beats, as a consumer brand known for premium pricing, a loyal customer base, and simple/iconic design, has more than a few things in common with Apple.

Though the verdict would appear large by normal standards, it is widely seen as a victory for Samsung: "The amount is less than 10% of the amount Apple requested, and probably doesn’t surpass by too much the amount Apple spent litigating  this case," says one legal analyst.

Although defense names have done well over the past couple of years, the Magic Formula continues to identify Northrop Grumman (NOC +0.2%), General Dynamics (GD +1.4%), and Raytheon (RTN +0.6%) as attractive. Firearm names Smith & Wesson (SWHC +0.8%) and Sturm Ruger (RGR +0.3%) also make the cut.

Citing strong phablet sales and extended upgrade cycles (something CIRP has already observed), IDC estimates global tablet shipments only rose 3.9% Y/Y in Q1 to 50.4M units. That's a marked slowdown from Q4's 28.2% growth, and also below IDC's full-year growth forecast of 19.4%.
Worth noting: Q1 comps were especially tough, given IDC estimated year-ago shipments were up 142% Y/Y. Easier comps for later quarters could help growth rebound a bit.
Apple (AAPL +0.3%), which last week reported its Q1 iPad units fell 16% Y/Y to 16.4M (Tim Cook partly blamed inventory changes), saw its share drop to 32.5% from 33.2% in Q4 and 40.2% a year ago. With the iPad's ASP at a steep $465, Apple's revenue share might still be above 50%.
Android (GOOG) tablets now make up ~2/3 of shipments - that's a positive for Google's traffic acquisition costs, given the huge Mobile Safari search ad payments it makes to Apple.
Samsung (SSNLF) grew its share to 22.3% from 18.8% in Q4 and 17.5% a year ago. Asus (ASUUY) had 5% of the market vs. 5.4% a year ago, and Lenovo (LNVGY) grew its share to 4.1% from a mere 1.3%.

Five days after Apple (AAPL +3.6%) reported its Japanese sales rose 26% Y/Y, Kantar estimates the company's Japanese share rose 860 bps 57.6%. On the other hand, its U.S. share fell 780 bps to 43.7%, and its Chinese share 540 bps to 17.9%. EU5 share rose fractionally to 19.2%.
Strong phablet sales boosted Android's Chinese position: Over 40% of the country's March smartphone sales involved 5"+ devices. Can a 5.5" iPhone give Apple a lift?
Following recent share gains, Kantar thinks Windows Phone (MSFT +2.3%) is slumping due to low-end Android competition: Though its 8.1% EU5 share is up 160 bps Y/Y, it's down from recent 9%+ levels.WP's U.S. and Chinese shares are respectively at 5.3% (-30 bps) and 1% (-90 bps).

A debt sale would add to the $17B that Apple raised a year ago, when demand topped $50B. |Apr. 25, 2014, 4:54 AM|Reuters: Tech giants pay $324M to settle no-hire lawsuit

 Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), Intel (INTC) and Adobe (ADBE) agreed to pay $324M to settle an antitrust class-action suit accusing them of creating illegal no-hire agreements in Silicon Valley to keep wages down, Reuters reports. The amount is far less than the $3.4B in damages that 64,000 employees were collectively seeking. That figure could have tripled had the case gone to trial and the workers won. The deal was disclosed yesterday, although financial terms weren't provided. |Apr. 24, 2014, 3:54 PM|Apple, Google, Intel, Adobe settle no-hire antitrust suit


Apple (AAPL +8.4%), Google (GOOG -0.4%), Intel (INTC - unchanged), and Adobe (ADBE -1.9%) have settled an antitrust suit accusing them of creating illegal no-hire agreements.
Terms are undisclosed for now. 64K employees had been collectively seeking $3B in damages, and antitrust rules could in theory triple that figure in the absence of a settlement.
The settlement comes after PandoDaily unearthed a slew of e-mails from Steve Jobs, Eric Schmidt, and others pointing to the existence of no-hire deals.
Separately, Google has denied media reports stating Glass is now publicly available. The company says it failed to edit an order page created for Glass' April 15 sale (thus giving the impression it's still available), and will be pulling the page shortly.

Apple (AAPL +8%) has received 5 PT hikes to go with one upgrade (from CLSA) following its iPhone-driven FQ2 beat, dividend/buyback increases, and split announcement.

Jefferies (Buy) isn't crazy about FQ3 guidance (it thinks FQ2 demand pull-in is a factor), but is pleased with the pickup in iPhone sales growth and recommends buying shares "ahead of what we believe will be a successful iPhone 6 launch."

Canaccord (Buy): "While our survey work indicates iPhone will likely lose share over the next several months to refreshed Android products, we believe Apple will win back meaningful high-end market share during [2H14]."

Nomura (Neutral) is more cautious, noting growth was just 0.4% Y/Y outside of China and Japan. But it also sees "little risk of a material negative disappointment in the coming months."
Also: 1) Ahead of Angela Ahrendts' arrival next week, Tim Cook suggests Apple plans to triple its Chinese store count over the next two years. 2) Many observers have pointed out Apple's split could lead it to join the Dow (DIA), given the index is price-weighted rather than valuation-weighted.

 Apple (AAPL) aims to deliver annual dividend hikes going forward, new CFO Luca Maestri states on the CC. With the company's domestic cash balance now at $18B, Apple will once more tap debt markets to help pay for its dividend and freshly-expanded buyback program. (CC live blogs: I, II) Tim Cook partly attributes FQ2's soft iPad sales to inventory changes; slowing tablet market growth might also be playing a role. iPad ASP was at $465, up from $440 in FQ1 and and $439 in FQ4 (suggests a mix shift towards the iPad Air). Healthy emerging markets demand contributed to iPhone strength - BRIC sales hit a record, thanks in part to China Mobile. iPhone ASP came in at $596 vs. $637 in FQ1 and $577 in FQ4; Maestri suggests a mix shift towards the 4S contributed to the Q/Q drop. Cook states Apple has bought 24 companies in the last 18 months - some are known to the public, but not all - and is "on the prowl" for deals. "We look for companies that have great people and great technology and that fit culturally and we don’t have a rule that says we can’t spend a lot or whatever." Also: 1) Angela Ahrendts will begin working as Apple's retail chief next week. 2) 20M Apple TVs have now been cumulatively sold. 3) Roughly half of all iPhone buyers and 2/3 of iPad buyers were new buyers of the respective products. 4) There are now nearly 800M iTunes accounts. Will credit cards linked to them be leveraged for a payments service?

4 months after launching 4G services and 3 months after beginning 4G iPhone (AAPL -0.1%) sales, China Mobile has announced it only had 2.79M 4G subs at the end of Q1.
One caveat: Not all of China Mobile's iPhone sales necessarily go to subs signing up for 4G services. China Mobile announced last month it added ~1M iPhone users and 1.34M 4G subs in February.
The WSJ takes a look at the efforts of U.S. carriers to lower subsidy spend, in part by offering discounts to consumers forgoing subsidies. AT&T's Randall Stephenson: "The industry is at a place where you can actually see line of sight to the subsidy equation just fundamentally changing in a very short period of time."
Apple's newest iPhones are typically subsidized by ~$450 by U.S. carriers in exchange for 2-year contracts. Tim Cook mentioned in January a shift by U.S. carriers to a hard 24-month wait between subsidies hurt FQ1 iPhone sales.

Expectations are low ahead of Wednesday's FQ2 report. Canaccord's checks suggest iPhone sales slowed in April due to competition and iPhone 6 anticipation. Also, UBS has cut FQ2/FQ3 iPhone estimates on concerns of weaker China Mobile and U.S. sales, and the consensus is for iPad sales to be flat to down Y/Y.
At the same time, many expect a dividend hike to be announced, and hopes are high for the iPhone 6. Susquehanna's checks lead it to think Apple is asking for 20%-30% more capacity from suppliers relative to the iPhone 5 and 5S launches.
|Apr. 21, 2014, 4:03 PM|Apple reportedly interviewing execs for new payments business



Re/code reports Apple (AAPL +1.2%) "has been interviewing senior payments industry executives to push ahead on a plan to build an electronic payments business." E-commerce chief Jennifer Bailey is said to be leading the initiative. "Their ambitions are very, very serious," says one source.
The WSJ reported in January Apple is "laying the groundwork" for a mobile payments push, albeit while leaving many questions unanswered regarding the kinds of transactions that will be covered, and which payments technologies will be used. Tim Cook later stated Apple is "intrigued" by the mobile payments space.
Apple has ~600M iTunes accounts (most of which are linked to credit cards) to leverage for a payments initiative, as well as complementary technologies such as fingerprint sensors and the iBeacon positioning platform. Android support (something Apple is reportedly considering for iTunes) would do a lot to extend the service's reach in markets where Google's OS dominates.
Re/code previously reported PayPal (EBAY -0.1%), whose services Apple could end up competing with, is pitching Apple on offering white-label solutions for its payments effort. But sources noted it's unlikely Apple would have any need for them.
|Apr. 14, 2014, 10:35 AM|Jefferies: Apple negotiating $100 iPhone 6 price hike with carriers


"Our checks indicate Apple (AAPL -0.3%) has started negotiating with carriers on a $100 iPhone 6 price increase. The initial response has been no, but there seems to be an admission that there is no other game-changing device this year," says Jefferies' Peter Misek.

Pac Crest cited the potential for higher iPhone 6 prices (owing to their expected larger displays) as a reason for upgrading Apple a month ago. As it is, the iPhone had a $637 ASP in the Dec. quarter, +$60 Q/Q thanks to strong 5S and soft 5C sales.

IDC estimates the smartphone industry's ASP was only at $335 last year, and will fall to $308 in 2014, as emerging markets continue growing their share of industry sales.
There's a good chance carriers will try to pass on most or all of any price hike to consumers, particularly given their recent efforts to lower subsidy spend, Pricing for Samsung's 5.7" Galaxy Note 3 (often sold for $300-$350 subsidized by U.S. carriers) points to an effort by carriers to charge a premium for high-end phablets.
In such a scenario, Apple would doubtlessly be counting on its high customer loyalty, along with pent-up demand for a bigger iPhone, to keep iPhone sales from slipping.
|Apr. 10, 2014, 12:52 PM|KGI: Apple launching bigger iPhones, iWatch, 12" MacBook Air in 2014


Apple's (AAPL -0.8%) 4.7" and 5.5" iPhones (widely rumored) will feature thinner bezels, NFC chips, and be only 6.5-7mm thick (thinner than the 7.6mm 5S), says KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo, whose past Apple product scoops have often (though not always) been accurate.
Kuo also expects the devices to have 1344x750 and 1920x1080 resolutions, run on the next-gen A8 CPU (no surprise), support optical image stabilization, and have side power buttons. The 5.5" model (reportedly seeing touch sensor-related delays) is expected later in 2H14 than the 4.7" model.
The much-anticipated iWatch is expected at the end of Q3. Kuo sees models with 1.3" and 1.5" displays launching, and expects them to include NFC chips, wireless charging support, and biometric (fingerprint?) recognition.
Apple has thus far held off on including NFC chips within its hardware. But they could assist with its rumored payments efforts.
The next-gen iPad Air and retina iPad Mini will both reportedly feature an A8 CPU and a fingerprint sensor, and the former will also get an 8MP camera. Kuo also thinks Apple is working on a 12.9" iPad (as rumored), but doesn't expect it this year. Samsung recently launched a 12.2" Galaxy Note ($750 starting price); all signs suggest sales have been limited.
A 12" retina MacBook Air is also said to be on tap. It reportedly will have a button-less touchpad and no fan.

9to5 Mac reports Jony Ive, already in charge of Apple's (AAPL) hardware and (since 2012) human interface design, will "soon completely subsume Apple’s software design group."
VP Greg Christie, who has been in charge of software design and reporting to iOS/Mac OS chief Craig Federighi, will reportedly be leaving Apple. Recent WSJ and NPR columns highlighted the major role Christie played in the iPhone's creation.

Ive spearheaded iOS 7's big UI overhaul, which included new icons, lighter colors, transparent effects, and an end to the departed Scott Forstall's skeuomorphic design ethos. Reviews of his work have been mixed.
Ive and Christie reportedly "clashed over design direction." Earlier this week, 9to5 Mac reported Mac OS X 10.10 will feature major design changes that bear Ive's fingerprints.

Update: Apple has confirmed Christie is leaving.

 9to5 Mac, fairly accurate with Apple (AAPL) scoops, has provided a lengthy review of the features its sources suggest will be included in iOS 8 and Mac OS X 10.10 (Syrah).
In addition to its previously-reported Healthbook app (meant to work with multiple health sensors), iOS 8 is expected to feature an overhauled Maps app with better transit data, a simplified Notification Center, Wi-Fi CarPlay support, and better app-to-app communication. Voice-over-LTE support and a separate iTunes Radio app might also be in the cards.
OS X 10.10 is expected to feature a major Jony Ive-led design overhaul to go with under-the-hood improvements. Apple is reportedly testing Siri and AirDrop support, but 9to5 Mac hasn't confirmed if those features will be ready in time.
Details on both operating systems are due at Apple's June 2-6 WWDC conference.
Hit-and-miss Digitimes reports Apple "plans to form an R&D team to develop baseband processors for use in iPhones to be released in 2015."
The iPhone and 4G iPad's baseband chips are currently supplied by Qualcomm (QCOM), which dominates the 4G baseband market and has used a massive R&D budget to develop a lead in fields such as frequency band support and category 6 LTE (300Mbps peak speeds) integration.
Apple has hired Amazon search VP Benoit Dupin. He reportedly will work on improving Apple Maps' search capabilities, which have received their share of criticism. |Apr. 7, 2014, 12:33 PM|Internal Apple docs show advertising, growth concerns


"I watched the Samsung (SSNLF) pre-superbowl ad that launched today. It’s pretty good and I can’t help but think ‘these guys are feeling it’ ... while we struggle to nail a compelling brief on iPhone. That’s sad because we have much better products," wrote Apple (AAPL -1.5%) marketing chief Phil Schiller in a 2013 e-mail to ad agency Media Arts unearthed during the latest Apple-Samsung trial.
In another e-mail, Schiller asked Tim Cook if Apple should consider finding a new agency. Media Arts saw the exec behind Apple's panned "Genius" ad campaign resign in 2012. Nonetheless, it remains Apple's ad agency today.

Interbrand estimates Apple's brand was worth $98.3B in 2013, +28% Y/Y and #1 globally. Samsung's brand was given a $39.6B valuation, +20% Y/Y and #8.
"Consumers want what we don't have," reads the title of a 2013 internal slide noting all of the smartphone industry's 2012 unit growth came from devices featuring sub-$300 unsubsidized prices and/or 4"+ screens. Apple is widely expected to launch two 4.5"+ iPhones, but there are no signs it plans to sacrifice its margins and $600+ iPhone ASP by going after the sub-$300 segment.
An Apple slide containing an Android logo states "competitors have drastically improved their hardware," and are "spending 'obscene' amounts of money" on ads and carrier/channel promotion. It also states carriers "have strong interest" in capping iPhone sales due to their steep subsidies and Apple's policies, among other factors.

The Nikkei reports Apple (AAPL +0.9%) is in talks with Renesas (RNECF) to buy its 55% stake in iPhone LCD driver IC supplier Renesas SP Drivers, and is looking to acquire it for ¥50B ($479M).
Sharp (SHCAY) owns 25% of Renesas SP, and Taiwan's Powerchip 20%. Sharp is expected to sell its stake to Apple if the company asks for a a deal after buying Renesas' interest.
Apple, which already develops its own app processors and fingerprint sensors, reportedly "wants to meld the design of core display components into overall product development."
A deal could be a positive for Himax (HIMX +3.9%) and MagnaChip (MX -0.6%), given Renesas SP's other clients would start looking for alternative LCD driver suppliers. Renesas SP has an estimated ~33% share of the market for small and mid-sized LCD drivers/controllers. It had revenue of ¥60B ($575M) during the fiscal year ending March 31.

Reuters' Tokyo bureau reports Japan Display will begin making LCDs for a 4.7" iPhone (AAPL +0.3%) as soon as May, and that Sharp and LG Display (LPL +1.3%) are set to begin around June.
However, production of displays for a 5.5" model is "expected to start several months later," due to challenges in producing in-cell touch sensors (used in recent iPhones) for the displays.

The Nikkei reported last week Sharp will be ramping iPhone 6 LCD production as soon as Q2, and that two larger models are likely. Before that, the WSJ reported two larger iPhones are on tap, and that the smaller model is further along in development.

The Nikkei reports Sharp (SHCAY) will ramp LCD production for the iPhone 6 (AAPL -0.1%) as soon as Q2, and that fingerprint sensor and LCD driver chip production for Apple's next-gen flagship has already begun.
The paper adds the iPhone 6 might launch in September (no surprise), and that it will likely be offered in 4.7" and 5.5" models (matches other reports). The WSJ reported in January Apple plans to launch two larger iPhones in 2H14, but added the smaller of the two devices is further along in development.
Pac Crest upgraded Apple earlier this month on iPhone 6 hopes, arguing a larger iPhone could boost Apple's ASP. The firm later stated initial iPhone 6 component orders imply a positive bias to its prior unit forecasts.
Many bulls are predicting the iPhone 6 will help Apple win back share, particularly in European/Asian markets where consumers have strongly embraced large-screen Android phones.

AppleInsider reports "multiple companies are already posting bids to build out a proposed expansion" of Apple's (AAPL) Mesa, AZ facility, where GT Advanced (GTAT +4.7%) is set to produce huge volumes of sapphire.
Construction for the existing facility (already making sapphire) is expected to be finished by June, at which point production should hit full capacity. Sources state the facility will eventually feature 1,700 sapphire furnaces.
9to5 Mac previously reported GT had taken delivery of 518 furnaces and had ordered another 420. That by itself could be enough to provide cover glass for hundreds of millions of iPhone displays.
Thanks to the Apple deal, GT is forecasting 2014 revenue of $600M-$800M, up from 2013's $299M. Its gross margin is expected to fall to 25%-27% from 31.1%.
|Mar. 24, 2014, 1:53 PM|More on Apple: Skepticism follows Comcast report


"It’s difficult to imagine a world in which Comcast would give up its network and control of customers that are streaming data through such a service," writes TechCrunch's Ryan Lawler, demonstrating the skepticism that has followed the WSJ's report about Apple's (AAPL +1.1%) TV service talks with Comcast.
In addition to doubts about Comcast's support, there are questions about Apple's ability to reach deals with TV network owners. Intel's pay-TV ambitions were derailed by a failure to reach such deals; Verizon, which bought Intel's TV unit, is hoping to launch a Web TV service with the help of FiOS' existing deals.
Also: Many think regulators would scrutinize an arrangement that provides Apple's services with dedicated network capacity.
One of the WSJ's sources states Apple and Comcast aren't close to a deal, with differences over customer control and data remaining an issue. In addition, the Comcast/Time Warner Cable deal is said to have stalled talks between Apple and TWC to have a next-gen Apple TV set-top support TWC's content (a much simpler proposition).

9to5 Mac has reported a new Apple TV set-top could arrive in 1H14. iLounge and others have reported the device will feature game controller support.
Skepticism or not, Comcast set-top supplier Arris (ARRS -6.1%) is down sharply amid a tech selloff.

Apple (AAPL +0.8%) appears "headed for a second-half sales bonanza" fueled by the arrival of one or more large-screen iPhone 6 models, writes Barron's Jack Hough.
He thinks the iPhone 6 launch could lead the percentage of iPhone owners who upgrade in a quarter to return to peak levels of 12%-14% later this year, after having fallen to ~9% in recent quarters. The iPhone has an installed base of 260M users.
Hough also exudes praise for Apple's "hardware-as-a-service" business model, and thinks shares could rise 20% to $635, or 13.6x C2015E EPS, next year, given Microsoft currently goes for 14.4x C2014E EPS.
Meanwhile, Pac Crest and UBS are each out with bullish notes. Pac Crest's checks lead it to think March and June quarter iPhone volumes could exceed its estimates of 39.7M and 33.6M, and that initial iPhone 6 component orders "[provide] a positive bias to our previous unit expectations."
UBS thinks the March and June quarters could be soft, largely due to iPhone 5C and iPad weakness, but thinks Sep. quarter sales will be healthy thanks to iPhone 6 demand.
Apple is ticking higher in the face of a 1.7% Nasdaq drop, as is supplier Cirrus Logic (CRUS +1.3%).

 Apple (AAPL) and Comcast (CMCSA) are in discussions about a service that would enable users to stream live and/or on-demand TV, and digital-video recordings stored in the cloud, the WSJ reports. The service would use an Apple set-top box and get special treatment over the "last mile" on Comcast's network so that downloads would be faster. The latter would have to make significant investments to provide the level of service that Apple is seeking. News of the talks follow a report that Apple is in negotiations with record labels about launching a Spotify-like music streaming subscription service. |Mar. 21, 2014, 7:12 PM|CIRP: iPad upgrade cycles longer than iPhone cycles


Whereas iPhones (AAPL) are typically replaced in the U.S. once every two years (as contracts expire), a CIRP survey of 2K consumers who bought an iPhone, iPad, or Mac in 2013 leads the firm to think iPads will see upgrade cycles closer to Macs (2-4 years) or TVs (5-10 years).
Even as of Dec. 2013, 78% of iPad buyers were purchasing a unit for the first time. That figure is down just moderately from March's 84%, and implies both healthy installed base growth and a slow pace to upgrades. Moreover, upgrading iPad owners were more than twice as likely as iPhone owners to give an older model to a friend or family member.
The survey provides some context for the broader tablet industry's growth slowdown. IDC expects both tablet and smartphone shipments to grow 19% this year, even though the smartphone market is nearly 5x the size of the tablet market.
The iPhone accounted for 56% of Apple's Dec. quarter revenue, and the iPad 20%.

Billboard reports Apple (AAPL) has "opened exploratory talks with senior label executives" about launching a Spotify-like music streaming subscription service, and is also thinking about offering an Android iTunes app.
Apple is also said to be weighing other efforts to support iTunes music sales, such as offering exclusive digital album-release windows, as it contends with a shifting digital music landscape.
Trade group IFPI estimates global music streaming and subscription service revenue rose 51% in 2013, and that download revenue (still 2/3 of all digital revenue) fell 2.1%. Apple's iTunes music ARPU has declined sharply in recent years amid a shift in user spend towards apps.
The launch of an Android app would be a first for Apple, whose mobile app launches have been iOS-only to date. If the app supported iTunes Radio, it would be a negative for Pandora (P), which thus far has been successful at dealing with iTunes Radio's challenge. P -1.4% AH.
The report comes amid growing signs Spotify is prepping for an IPO.
|Mar. 20, 2014, 1:58 PM|China Mobile added ~1M iPhone users in February



The disclosure comes from China Mobile (CHL -2.6%) CEO Li Yue following the carrier's Q4 report. Chairman Xi Gouhua says China Mobile added 1.34M 4G subs in February, and that "most of them" were iPhone (AAPL -0.3%) users.
Piper's Gene Munster calls the iPhone number "a disappointment," but remains optimistic about the long-term opportunity. Credit Suisse says the number is in-line with its views, and chalks it up to high prices and 4G network quality issues. Cantor's Brian White is counting on the arrival of bigger iPhones later this year to boost China Mobile sales.
China Mobile began selling the iPhone on Jan. 17, after commencing pre-registrations on Christmas. 1.2M pre-registrations had been tallied by Jan. 15. Street estimates for the carrier's 2014 iPhone sales have ranged from 10M to 20M+.
China Mobile's had 776M mobile subs as of Feb. 28. But a large portion of them can't afford the $700+ prices attached to unsubsidized Chinese iPhone 5S/5C sales. 2013 ARPU was only RMB67 ($10.75).
|Mar. 18, 2014, 9:41 AM|8GB iPhone 5C rolled out; iPad 2 replaced with 4th-gen model


As rumored, Apple (AAPL) has rolled out an 8GB iPhone 5C in European markets. The device goes for £429 ($712) unsubsidized in the U.K., or £40 ($66) less than the 16GB model. Apple hasn't yet begun offering the 8GB model in the U.S., nor has it discontinued the 8GB iPhone 4S (£349 in the U.K.).
Also: Apple is discontinuing the iPad 2, and will now offer the 4th-gen iPad at the iPad 2's old price points (16GB Wi-Fi-only model goes for $399).
While thicker and heavier than the iPad Air (starts at $499), the 4th-gen iPad boasts much better specs (retina display, A6X CPU vs. A5, 5MP rear camera vs. 0.9MP) than the iPad 2. Apple's October decision to keep the iPad 2 in its lineup following the Air launch, rather than offer the 4th-gen iPad at a discount, had raised eyebrows.
26M iPads were sold in Q4 (+13.5% Y/Y) at a $440 ASP. IDC put the tablet's Q4 share at 33.8% (-440 bps Y/Y).
|Mar. 17, 2014, 12:56 PM|Leaked docs point to cheaper iPhone 5C



Leaked documents from German carrier O2 indicate Apple (AAPL +0.9%) is launching an 8GB iPhone 5C sporting a local retail price €60 ($83) below that of the current 16GB 5C.
The launch of an 8GB 5C could lead Apple to discontinue the 8GB iPhone 4S, currently the cheapest available model in most markets (the iPhone 4 is still available in some emerging markets). The 4S goes for an unsubsidized $450 in the U.S. (it's free with subsidies), and the 16GB 5C for $550.
Sales of the plastic-shell 5C have underwhelmed, as buyers in most markets overwhelmingly opt for the more advanced, aluminum, 5S. Soft 5C sales were a reason Apple missed Dec. quarter iPhone unit forecasts, albeit while posting a $60 Q/Q iPhone ASP increase.
|Mar. 17, 2014, 10:58 AM|Report: Jobs didn't want Apple to make a TV set


"TV is a terrible business. They don't turn over and the margins suck," Steve Jobs remarked during a 2010 meeting of Apple's (AAPL +0.5%) top 100 employees, according to ex-Apple beat reporter Yukari Iwatani Kane's Haunted Empire: Apple After Steve Jobs (previous).
However, Jobs expressed an interest in controlling the living room. In 2011, Jobs biographer Walter Isaacson quoted the Apple co-founder as saying he'd like to "create an integrated television set that is completely easy to use."
While predictions of an Apple TV set launch have been consistently off, the Apple TV set-top has turned into a $1B/year business (after factoring content spend), and is expected to see a 2014 refresh that will add support for game controllers and pay-TV content. In addition, Apple recently snapped up gesture recognition sensor developer PrimeSense.
Whether for TV sets, set-tops, or both, Hollywood's unwillingness to agree to content deals that would seriously disrupt the pay-TV industry's status quo have affected the living room ambitions of Apple, Intel, Microsoft, and others.
Separately, Jony Ive has provided a fresh interview in which he reiterates Apple's product philosophy. "We’re surrounded by anonymous, poorly made objects ... what we’ve shown is that people do care. It’s not just about aesthetics. They care about things that are thoughtfully conceived and well made."
|Mar. 13, 2014, 4:26 AM|Tech giants enjoy tax-free interest on offshore Treasury holdings

 Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) hold a combined $124B in U.S. Treasurys and a further $39B in other government debt, the U.K.'s Bureau of Investigative Journalism calculates. The tech giants appear to hold much U.S. debt offshore, which enables them to earn tax-free interest. Repatriating the assets would saddle them with a huge tax bill. Unsurprisingly, Senator Carl Levin is not happy. "If a U.S. multinational puts its offshore cash into a U.S. bank and uses the money to buy U.S. Treasurys, stocks and bonds, those funds ought to be treated as having been repatriated and subject to US tax." |Mar. 11, 2014, 7:12 PM|Apple roundup: iOS 8, iPhone 6, iTunes Radio



9to5 Mac reports iOS 8 will feature a major overhaul of Apple Maps (AAPL). The UI will be revamped; transportation/POI data from recent acquisitions BroadMap, HopStop, and Embark will be included, and public transit directions (frequently requested) will be added.
Apple is also said to have "begun work on augmented reality functionality that leverages the iPhone’s compass hardware to visually see nearby points of interest," though this feature isn't expected in iOS 8. The report comes as Google launches Project Tango, a 3D-scanning/motion-tracking solution.
Japanese site Macotakara (has a mixed track record) reports Apple plans to launch 4.7" and 5.7" next-gen iPhones, and that the devices will take design cues from the iPod Nano (uses anodized aluminum, is available in several colors). Other reports have stated 4.7" and 5.5" iPhones are on tap.
An Edison Research survey of 2K Americans aged 12 and older found 8% claiming to use iTunes Radio. That figure is above Spotify's 6%, and nearly matches iHeartRadio's 9%. Pandora (P) still dominates with a 31% share.

|Mar. 11, 2014, 9:23 AM|Pac Crest upgrades Apple on iPhone 6 hopes


Pac Crest's Andy Hargreaves has upgraded Apple (AAPL) to Outperform, and set a $635 PT. He thinks a 4.7" iPhone 6 will arrive in the fall (in-line with reports), and that a base model will sell for a relatively steep subsidized price of $299; that could imply an unsubsidized price of $749.
Hargreaves estimates a 4.7" iPhone could boost the iPhone's total FY15 (ends in Sep.) unit sales by 10M to 170.4M, while lifting its ASP by $36 to $641 and its EPS contribution by $4 to $33.04.
He isn't counting on a 5.5" iPhone (also rumored to be in the pipeline) arriving this year. At the same time, he thinks new product launches (an iWatch?) provide "optionality" to Apple shares.
Hargreaves downgraded Apple on Jan. 16, 2013, when shares were at $471.

|Mar. 7, 2014, 7:05 PM|IDC cuts 2014 tablet forecast; ASP decline expected to narrow


Citing "slowing consumer purchases" amid high penetration rates in mature markets, IDC now forecasts tablet shipments will grow 19.4% in 2014 (to 260.9M units), down from a prior estimate of 22% (271M units).
Tablet growth steadily slowed in 2014: Shipments rose an estimated 142% in Q1, but just 28% in Q4. IDC puts full-year growth at 52%.
Two silver linings for high-end/enterprise leader Apple (AAPL - 33.8% Q4 share): 1) ASPs are only expected to drop 3.6% in 2014, after falling 14.6% in 2013, as more consumers embrace "higher-end devices." 2) Commercial buyers are expected to account for 14% of shipments, up from 11% in 2013.
IDC also thinks Windows (MSFT) tablets, struggling to gain a strong consumer foothold, will take over a quarter of the commercial segment thanks to rising convertible adoption.
The revised forecast still puts tablet sales within striking distance of eclipsing PC sales: IDC expects PC shipments to drop 6% this year to 295.9M. Smartphone shipments are expected to grow 19% to 1.2B.
Major tablet OEMs (besides Apple): SSNLF, LNVGY, AKCPF

 Judge Lucy Koh has turned down a request from Apple (AAPL) to ban certain Samsung (SSNLF) mobile products in the U.S. because of patent infringements. However, Koh did complete a $929.8M damages award to Apple stemming from the companies' IP dispute. Apple and Samsung are due to face each other again this month in a trial over Apple patents different to those involved in the $929.8M award. |Mar. 5, 2014, 6:06 PM|IDC: Chinese, global smartphone growth to slow rapidly in 2014/2015


After growing ~60% in 2013 (and fueling global shipment growth of 39%), IDC expects Chinese smartphone shipment growth to slow to ~20% in 2014 and just ~10% in 2015.
Though only 40% of China's 1B+ mobile users now use a smartphone, IDC's Kiranjeet Kaur notes most users who can comfortably afford a smartphone have already bought one. Plunging low-end Android prices could expand the addressable market in a country whose nominal per capita GDP is around $6K.
India, which has a sub-10% smartphone penetration rate, still presents a major growth opportunity. But with a nominal per capita GDP of ~$1,500, the country is even more cost-sensitive than China.
With China slowing down and developed markets living up to their name, IDC expects global smartphone growth to slow to 19% in 2014; that still spells total volumes of 1.2B. Tough competition and the ongoing mix shift towards emerging markets is expected to lead the industry's ASP to fall $27 to $308.

|Mar. 3, 2014, 1:31 PM|Apple roundup: CarPlay, VirnetX royalty rate, Asian hiring


Apple (AAPL -0.2%) has launched CarPlay, its expected platform for pairing iPhones with in-dash automotive systems. Mercedes-Benz, Ferrari, and Volvo are rolling out cars that support CarPlay; most other major automakers plan to do so later.
Among other things, CarPlay (formerly called iOS in the Car), leverages Siri to make calls and send texts, allows Maps and related navigation/traffic services to be displayed in-dash, and provides access to iTunes and 3rd-party music platforms (Spotify, iHeartRadio). iTunes Radio rival Pandora (P +0.2%), which has struck plenty of automotive deals of its own, is notably absent.
Google is partnering with top automakers to launch Android/Google Now-based in-dash systems. BlackBerry's QNX is reportedly set to be adopted by Ford.
VirnetX has been awarded a 0.98% royalty rate on Apple products deemed to be infringing its VPN-related patents; the company's shares have soared in response. Apple, whose workaround for VirnetX's IP has resulted in many user complaints, will likely appeal.

The WSJ reports Apple is hiring hundreds of engineers and supply-chain managers in China and Taiwan help with new product launches. Larger iPhones appear to be among the products in question; an iWatch and larger iPad could be among them as well.
|Mar. 2, 2014, 8:30 AM|Apple's Haunted Empire

 Apple's (AAPL) CEO "could strike terror in the hearts of his subordinates," writes Yukair Kane in a new book, "but he could also motivate them to toil from dawn to midnight for just a word of praise." That's not Steve Jobs that Kane is writing about, but Tim Cook when he was still COO. Still, Cook is a "more traditional CEO who infused Apple with a healthier work environment" and is more open with investors. Despite this, there are those who yearn for more subversive days amid fears that Apple is becoming more stodgy and as the ghost of Steve Jobs continues to hang over the company. Kane's book is called, "Haunted Empire: Apple After Steve Jobs." |Feb. 28, 2014, 1:42 PM|Cook: Apple TV did more than $1B in FY13 sales


Apple TV did over $1B in FY13 sales, says Tim Cook at Apple's (AAPL -0.3%) annual meeting. "It's a little more difficult to call it a hobby these days."
With Apple TV set-tops typically going for $99, Horace Dediu thinks Cook's remarks imply 10M+ unit sales, up from 2012's 6M. The business still accounts for only a small percentage of Apple's total sales (FY13 revenue was $170.9B).
Cook's comments come amid reports of a pending Apple TV refresh that will add game controller support and access to select pay-TV content.
As expected, all of Apple's shareholder proposals were approved, and all proposals from other shareholders were rejected. Carl Icahn withdrew his non-binding Apple buyback proposal earlier this month.

Update: Apple tells re/code Cook's Apple TV figure includes content sales, and refers to Apple's FY13 (ended Sep. 13).

 A German court has thrown out a €1.57B ($2.15B) lawsuit that accused Apple (AAPL) of infringing two patents that allow mobile phones to make emergency calls even when networks are overloaded.

Asian checks suggest an iPhone 6 (AAPL -0.7%) could launch in July, says Mizuho's Abhey Lamba (Outperform, $575 PT). Lamba adds supply chain vendors are gearing up for a new iPhone launch earlier than they did in prior years.

Multiple reports have stated Apple plans to launch two larger iPhones this year. The WSJ reported last month the smaller model is "further along in development, and is being prepared for mass production."
Lamba also backs up reports that the larger iPhones will have 4.7" and 5.5" displays, respectively, and that an iWatch and Apple TV set-top are being prepped.
Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty (Overweight) observes Apple's top-30 shareholders own "a record low" 30% of shares, even as top-30 ownership for other tech names (Google, Amazon, Microsoft, H-P) is at or near record levels. Apple's 5-year average is 36%; a peak of 40% was reached in 2009.
|Feb. 24, 2014, 2:40 PM|Samsung unveils Galaxy S5. U.S. launch set for April.


As expected, Samsung (SSNLF, SSNGY) has unveiled its next-gen flagship smartphone at a Mobile World Congress event (live blog). Whereas the Korean electronics giant trumpeted a variety of bells and whistles (some might say gimmicks) when launching the Galaxy S4 a year ago, it's taking a more low-key approach with the S5.
The S5 has a 5.1" display, just slightly larger than the S4's 5" display. The resolution is unchanged at 1080p; past reports had pointed to a 2K resolution. Like Apple (AAPL) with the iPhone 5S, Samsung is integrating a fingerprint sensor into the S5's home button, and is offering a gold model.
A 16MP camera supporting 4K video recording is included (the S4 has a 13MP camera), as is a perforated back meant to provide better grip. Qualcomm's (QCOM +0.2%) Snapdragon 801 baseband/app processor (2.5GHz., quad-core) powers the device. A heart rate monitor and slightly larger battery are also on board.
Remarks from co-CEO JK Shin point to a shift in Samsung's product philosophy, one that arguably meshes with reports of a deal with Google to tone down Samsung's efforts to customize its hardware. "Our consumers do not want eye-popping technology or the most complex technology."
Likely S5 suppliers with strong exposure: OLED, MXIM, SYNA, ANAD

Bustly asserts "most of the world's developers" rely on TestFlight for for app beta testing, crash reporting, and analytics. Unsurprisingly, the company recently shut down Android support.
Look for Apple to add TestFlight (one of several independent app testing platforms on the market) to its arsenal of iOS developer tools. As it is, companies have often reported their development costs are lower for iOS apps than for Android counterparts.

Barclays' Ben Reitzes, a staunch Apple (AAPL -1%) bull for years, has downgraded shares to Equalweight, albeit while maintaining his $570 PT.
Reitzes thinks Apple will be in a trading range for the next year due to a maturing smartphone market and the margin impact of adding new iPhone features such as "sapphire glass, curved glass, and new batteries."
He also compares Apple's current valuation to Microsoft's from 2000-2010, and argues there's "no precedent that large-size tech companies simply start to broadly outperform again after a tough year or two if the law of large numbers is catching up to them and margins have peaked."
Meanwhile, Tesla (TSLA +8.2%) founder/CEO Elon Musk has confirmed a recent report that he met with Apple's management, but declines to comment on whether "any kind of acquisition" was discussed.
The San Francisco Chronicle recently reported Musk met with Apple M&A chief Adrian Perica and "probably" Tim Cook last April. It's worth noting Tesla shares traded at a fraction of current levels at the time; the EV maker's current market cap is $26B.
Many observers have drawn comparisons between Apple and Tesla in the past. An Apple board member has claimed Steve Jobs dreamed of designing an iCar.

"It's almost like going into a room and them putting a gun to your head and showing you your future," says an exec at ad giant GroupM about Amazon's (AMZN) ad sales approach. Another industry exec talking with Ad Age says Amazon's lack of a personal touch when courting Madison Ave. hurts its success.
After interviewing "a dozen people close to the companies," Ad Age suggests both Amazon and Apple (AAPL) are experiencing growing pains as they try to grow their ad ops. While advertising is largely a sideshow for Apple - Tim Cook has said iAd's main goal is to help developers make money - Amazon wants to use its oceans of data to mount a challenge to 800-lb. gorilla Google, as well as drive more e-commerce activity.
Nonetheless, Amazon has been cautious about sharing transactional data with ad agencies. One exec says Amazon hasn't agreed to a request to "divulge data about what's in shoppers' carts to inform ads." Another suggests the company could be more proactive in providing case studies.
Last year, eMarketer estimated Amazon had 2012 ad sales of $609M, and forecast 2013 sales of $835M.

Apple Insider reports Apple (AAPL +1.4%) is set to discontinue the iPad 2, given the relative popularity of the iPad Air and Mini.
Apple's decision to keep the iPad 2 (originally launched in 2011) around at an unchanged price of $399 following last fall's Air/retina Mini launches raised eyebrows. Wal-Mart recently offered the iPad 2 for $299 in a promotion.
Images said to depict iPhone 6 casings have leaked out of China. The images show a device that has a larger screen than the 4" iPhone 5S/5C, and is also thinner.
The WSJ, Bloomberg, and others have reported Apple plans to launch two larger iPhones; Bloomberg's reported stated the screen sizes will respectively be 4.7" and 5.5".
Jefferies' Peter Misek has cut his FQ3 (calendar Q2) iPhone sales forecast by 3M to 33M, citing checks that point to builds of only 25M-30M and expectations of soft demand ahead of an iPhone 6 launch.
At the same time, Misek reports Apple's suppliers "continue to give pricing concessions," something he predicts will lift margins. Misek's report could be a negative for Apple-dependent Cirrus Logic (CRUS -0.4%), whose gross margin has already been under pressure.

Update: The images may be fake. Observers have noted textures and fonts are inconsistent with those of the iPhone 5S.

Bloomberg reports Apple (AAPL +0.3%) plans to launch a new Apple TV set-top as soon as April, and is still talking with Time Warner Cable (TWC -0.1%) and others about supporting their content.
The news service cautions the set-top's launch date could change due to the timing of content deals. It reported last July a deal with Time Warner Cable is expected to happen within a few months. Unlike many of their peers, TWC execs have suggested they're comfortable giving up UI control for hardware that supports their services.

Recent reports indicate a next-gen Apple TV will also support physical game controllers, and thus act as a casual gaming alternative to traditional consoles. Amazon and Google are also reportedly working on set-tops that support gaming.

Chinese sites report Apple's (AAPL +1.4%) iWatch will feature sapphire cover glass, but its next-gen iPhone won't due to cost concerns.
Apple sapphire manufacturing partner GT Advanced (GTAT -5.1%) is selling off, while Gorilla Glass supplier Corning (GLW +1.4%) is following the tech sector higher.
9to5 Mac reported last week GT has received delivery of 518 sapphire chamber/furnace systems - enough, according to one analyst, to provide cover glass for 103M-116M 5" iPhones per year - and is ordering another 420 systems.
It's worth noting Apple is generally believed to obtain a 50%+ gross margin on its latest-gen iPhones, and hasn't been scared in the past to use costlier components for the sake of improving the user experience.

ISS cited Apple's buybacks and dividend payments as a reason for its opinion. Apple bought back $14B in stock in the fortnight after releasing its latest quarter earnings results, and it has repurchased $40B over the past year.

Carl Icahn must be smiling: Apple (AAPL +1.8%) has rallied back above $520 following news the company has bought back $14B worth of shares (~3% of outstanding shares) since its post-earnings selloff, after spending just $5B during the December quarter.

Wells Fargo estimates Apple's latest purchases stand to boost FQ2 EPS by $0.23, FY14 EPS by $0.63, and FY15 EPS by $1.02. The firm also expects Apple will hike its dividend (current yield of 2.3%) in the March/April timeframe, but (given only $34.4B of Apple's cash is in the U.S.) thinks another debt offering will be needed in order to return more cash.

Barclays is happy Tim Cook also reiterated Apple plans to launch a new product category this year (widely taken as an iWatch hint). Though maintaining an Overweight, JPMorgan offers a more subdued take, suggesting will continue focusing on slowing iPhone sales over the near-term.
Meanwhile, shareholder advisory firm Egan-Jones is urging Apple investors to vote against Icahn's (non-binding) $50B FY14 buyback resolution. Apple has already come out against Icahn's proposal.

A week after uncovering documents suggesting Apple (AAPL) is set to begin sapphire production at its Mesa, AZ facility in February, 9to5 Mac reports manufacturing partner GT Advanced (GTAT) has received delivery of 518 sapphire furnace/chamber systems.
Analyst Matt Margolis estimates that's enough capacity to produce sapphire cover glass for 103M-116M 5" iPhone displays per year. Another 420 systems are said to be on order (good for 84M-94M additional displays). GT Advanced shares are up 4.7% AH.
Apple has extended its multi-year licensing deal with leading GPU core developer Imagination (IGNMF), whose PowerVR cores are found within Apple's A-series processors.
The deal is a blow to ARM (ARMH), which has been hoping Apple would adopt its Mali GPU cores. 400M Mali GPUs were shipped in 2013, up from 150M in 2012.

The NYT reports Apple (AAPL - unchanged) has been testing the use of wireless (inductive) charging for the iWatch. Apple has also reportedly considered adding "a solar-charging layer" to the iWatch's display, and experimented with motion-based charging that relies on arm movement to generate power.
A handful of smartphones already support inductive charging, and so does Qualcomm's proof-of-concept Toq smartwatch. With watch owners accustomed to rarely needing to replace their batteries, long battery life is bound to be an iWatch R&D priority for Apple. Samsung's Galaxy Gear has often been criticized for offering (on average) only a day of use per charge.

9to5 Mac has reported iOS 8 will feature a Healthbook app that (likely with the help of Apple's M7 motion co-processor and various sensors) will be able to track a user's blood pressure, hydration, and heart rate, as well as monitor fitness stats such as steps taken and calories burned.
The report coincides with one from the NYT stating Apple execs have met with FDA directors to "discuss mobile medical applications." Both reports follow Apple's hiring of medical/fitness experts, and amid expectations the iWatch will offer a variety of health/fitness features.
Apple is reportedly building a content delivery network (CDN) to support app/content downloads. The company has thus far relied on 3rd-party CDNs such as Akamai and Level 3 to handle its surging data traffic load. It's worth noting Apple has set an FY14 capex budget of $11B (+57% Y/Y).
AT&T is making a fresh attempt to lower its phone subsidy expenses (previous) by offering cheaper family plans for users who forgo traditional subsidies. Tim Cook mentioned on the FQ1 CC carrier attempts to lower subsidized upgrades pressured North American iPhone sales.

 State attorneys general and consumers have sued Apple (AAPL) for $840M over its e-book pricing.
The suit comes after District Judge Denise Cote ruled in July that Apple had manipulated prices in cohorts with five publishers. Meanwhile, Apple is trying to halt the work of Michael Bromwich, a compliance monitor that Cote appointed to oversee the company following her ruling. Separately, senior Apple executives have met FDA directors to discuss mobile medical applications. An FDA public calendar lists the participants in the meeting.

9to5 Mac has uncovered documents that suggest Apple (AAPL) plans to begin sapphire production at its new Mesa, AZ facility in February, a timetable that suggests the facility's output could be used in products launching later this year. GT Advanced (GTAT +6.1%), which will be producing large quantities of sapphire for Apple at the facility, is getting a lift from the news.
GT shares rallied last week following a Taiwanese report stating Foxconn has built at least 100 iPhone prototypes featuring sapphire cover glass. Ten days before that, 9to5 Mac found an Apple job listing (since removed) that stated the Mesa facility will be used to make iPhone/iPod components.

Carl Icahn on Twitter: "Just bought $500 mln more $AAPL shares. My buying seems to be going neck-and-neck with Apple's buyback program, but hope they win that race."
Following two $500M purchases last week, Icahn's Apple (AAPL -7.2%) stake had risen to $3.6B. After taking today's selloff into account, his stake is now likely in the $4B range.
Apple's shares haven't received much of a lift from Icahn's latest disclosure.

 |Jan. 27, 2014, 6:44 PM|Cook: Carrier policies hurt N.A. sales; Apple "intrigued" by payments


Peter Oppenheimer states channel inventory shifts are partly responsible for Apple's (AAPL) FQ2 sales guidance. Whereas inventories rose in FQ2 a year ago due to iPhone 5/iPad Mini shortages in FQ1, Apple exited this year's FQ1 with iPhone/iPad supply and demand nearly in balance. Of course, that also means inventory shifts gave a lift to Apple's Y/Y performance in FQ1.
Oppenheimer also notes the impact of revenue deferrals - Apple's deferred revenue balance rose 13% Q/Q to $11.4B, as a portion of hardware sales get deferred due to software/services bundling.
Tim Cook says changes in carrier policies (a hard requirement for 24 months between subsidized upgrades) hurt North American iPhone sales; U.S. carriers have been trying hard to lower subsidy expenses. On the other hand, Cook declares last week (China Mobile's launch week) was Apple's best yet for Chinese iPhone activations.

Cook on mobile payments: "The mobile payments area in general is one that we’ve been intrigued with and that was one of the thoughts behind the Touch ID. But we’re not limiting ourselves just to that." The comments come in the wake of the WSJ's report about an Apple payments service.
Also: 1) 78% of Apple's $159B cash/investment balance is offshore. 2) Japanese iPhone sales, boosted by DoCoMo's launch, rose 40% Y/Y. But a weak yen resulted in Apple's total Japanese revenue rising only 11%. Chinese iPhone sales rose 20%. 3) Cook doesn't say much about buybacks in the face of Carl Icahn's ongoing campaign, other than to reiterate Apple has "been a big believer" in them.

Apple (AAPL +1.2%) is rising going into today's FQ1 report, and PayPal parent eBay (EBAY -2%) is selling off, after the WSJ reported Apple is hatching plans for a mobile payments service. Point-of-sale hardware vendors VeriFone (PAY -2.3%) and NCR (NCR -2.6%) are also lower.
The report left some major questions unanswered. A big one: Will Apple's service only cover transactions taking place in physical stores, or will it also cover mobile e-commerce transactions?
The latter would be a much larger threat to PayPal, which handled $27B worth of mobile transactions (largely e-commerce-related) in 2013, but for now only has a small presence in the offline payments realm (the company is trying hard to change that).
Given Apple's history, an Apple payments service is unlikely to support Android. That could limit merchant interest in regions where Android has a dominant smartphone share (the EU, Latin America, parts of Asia), assuming Apple plans to take the service overseas.

Carl Icahn mentioned payments as a major growth opportunity for Apple last week, highlighting the company's ability to leverage its 575M+ iTunes accounts, fingerprint sensors, and iBeacon.
Analysts expects Apple to report FQ1 EPS of $14.09 (+2% Y/Y) this afternoon, and revenue of $57.46B (+5.4%). Gene Munster believes the Street expects 56M-57M iPhone sales, 24M-25M iPad sales, 4.6M Mac sales, and a gross margin of 37.5% (at the high end of Apple's guidance range).

 Apple (AAPL) is working to expand its mobile-payments service so that its devices can enable users to buy goods and services, the WSJ reports. Jennifer Bailey, who managed Apple's online stores, has been given the job of building the company' payment business, while  iTunes and App Store chief Eddy Cue has been talking with relevant industry executives. The report follows Apple patent activity related to mobile payments. With iTunes having 575M registered users, the potential looks rather interesting and the service could pose a serious threat to the likes of PayPal (EBAY) and Square. Meanwhile, the NYT reports on an interview that Steve Jobs gave in November 1983 to then Rolling Stone reporter Steven Levy, who's publishing the transcript of the conversation to celebrate 30 years of the Macintosh. At the time, Levy left much of the interview out of an article he wrote about the Mac for the magazine. "It's like computers and society are out on a first date in this decade," Jobs said of the 1980s. "For some crazy reason we're just in the right place at the right time to make that romance blossom." |Jan. 24, 2014, 5:36 PM|Reports: Apple prototypes sapphire iPhones, preps Apple TV with game support


Taiwan's Apple Daily reports (translation) Foxconn has built at least 100 iPhone (AAPL -1.8%) prototypes featuring sapphire cover glass. The paper also reports two existing sapphire suppliers have recently made big equipment/tooling investments; Apple already uses sapphire in its iPhone home buttons and camera lens covers.
The report comes two months after Apple announce a major sapphire production/supply deal with GT Advanced (GTAT +0.9%), one that naturally fueled speculation sapphire will be used as a cover glass in future iDevices.
Corning (GLW -4.1%) investors have been on edge over Apple's moves, and their potential to drive broader mobile adoption of sapphire (thereby displacing Gorilla Glass).
Separately, 9to5 Mac reports a new Apple TV set-top is set to arrive in 1H14, and iLounge reports a refreshed Apple TV will feature "proper game support." With iOS 7 supporting physical game controllers, Apple TV has already been expected by many to become a casual gaming console. Logitech (LOGI), which has already rolled out an iPhone game controller, wouldn't mind.

"Given the degree to which Apple (AAPL +0.9%) appears undervalued to us, we almost feel that it’s a waste of time to debate the point," says Carl Icahn in a letter outlining his bullish stance on the tech giant.
Icahn trumpets Apple's remaining smartphone/tablet growth potential, and considers pricing/margin concerns unjustified given Apple's strong customer loyalty. He also sees major growth opportunities in the TV, wearable, and payments markets.
Icahn estimates Apple could produce $40B/year in revenue and $15B/year in op. income if its sold 25M TV sets/year (compares with an estimated 2012 market of 238M units) at a $1,600 ASP, and achieved its current company-wide gross margin of 37.7% (well above traditional TV industry margins).
In addition, he views Apple's 575M+ credit card numbers (courtesy of iTunes), fingerprint sensors, and iBeacon mobile positioning platform translating into a huge mobile payments opportunity.
Naturally, Icahn uses his bullish view of Apple's earnings power to argue the company shouldn't be scared to buy back more stock. He doubts Apple needs a major cash hoard for acquisitions, given its conservative M&A track record, and notes it can still raise cheap debt: The company's 5-year bonds yield just 2%, and its 10-year bonds 3.63%.

Backing up several reports in recent months, the WSJ reports Apple (AAPL -0.8%) plans to launch two larger iPhones in 2H14: One with a 4.5"+ display, and one with a 5"+ display.
The paper adds both devices will use metal casings and won't feature curved displays, and that Apple is "expected to scrap the plastic exterior used in the iPhone 5C."
The WSJ previously reported Apple is evaluating iPhones with 4.8"-6" displays, and Bloomberg has reported Apple plans to launch 4.7" and 5.5" iPhones with "glass that curves downward at the edges."
More recently, Cowen's Timothy Arcuri has said supply chain checks point to the launch of a 4.8" iPhone supporting the high-speed 802.11ac Wi-Fi standard (already supported by various Apple and Samsung devices). Like others, Arcuri also expects a ~13" iPad to launch this year.
Calls for Apple to offer larger iPhones have been widespread amid soaring demand for large-screen Android devices, particularly in China and other parts of Asia-Pac. The launches could allow Apple to win back some European and Asian smartphone share lost in recent quarters to Samsung (SSNLF, SSNGY) and others.

Sell on the news? After rallying on Wednesday following reports of solid China Mobile iPhone pre-registrations - CNBC reported 1.2M - Apple (AAPL -1.1%) is trading lower on launch day.

The NYT reports "only about a dozen customers" showed up at a Beijing store to buy iPhones, in spite of an appearance by Tim Cook, and that the huge lines accompanying some past Apple launches haven't existed.  Launch pictures posted by journalist Jahangir Naina appear to show healthy interest.

China Mobile's pricing is raising eyebrows. The carrier, which has an ARPU in the ~$10/month range, is selling the 16GB iPhone 5S for RMB5,288 ($874) unsubsidized, and for RMB5,488 ($907) with a 2-year, $23/month contract (its cheapest iPhone contract plan). The WSJ observes China Unicom and Telecom offer cheaper iPhone plans.
With the iPhone squaring off against Android phones that (per research firm Umeng) carry an unsubsidized ASP of just $233 within China, China Mobile's pricing/subsidy support could have a big impact on whether the carrier is able to hit bullish sell-side forecasts for 20M+ 2014 iPhone sales.

 Apple (AAPL) has finally launched the iPhone on China Mobile's (CHL) massive network, but despite the carrier's 763M subscribers, skepticism exists about how much the companies will benefit. "You need to consider the cannibalization of (iPhone) sales from China Unicom (CHU), China Telecom (CHA) and the grey market," says Gartner analyst CK Lu. "So even though there's an addition from China Mobile, it will also impact sales from other channels as well." As for China Mobile, there are concerns about subsidies it might have to pay. "I don't see a price war coming where Apple is engaged in the war, but I do think you're going to see a subsidy war coming," says Michael Clendenin of Shanghai-based RedTech Advisors. |Jan. 15, 2014, 3:55 AM|China Mobile receives 1.2M iPhone pre-orders

A source tells the WSJ Foxconn shipped ~1.4M iPhone 5S (AAPL +1.7%) units to China Mobile last week in advance of the carrier's Friday 5S/5C launch.
The report follows cautious notes from Cleveland Research and Wedge Partners regarding early China Mobile iPhone demand. Estimates for China Mobile's 2014 iPhone sales have generally been in the 15M-30M range, and forecasts for the EPS benefit to Apple in the $2-$4 range.
The Economic Times reports Apple is set to re-launch the 8GB iPhone 4 in cost-sensitive India, after losing share to Samsung as a result of discontinuing the device.
The NYT recently discussed how the iPhone, which picked up Indian share last year with the help of aggressive marketing and installment plans, has become a status symbol in the world's second-most populous country.
By acquiring intelligent thermostat/smoke alarm maker Nest for $3.2B, Google is buying a company many thought would one day be acquired by Apple.

Sources tell re/code Google was the only serious bidder.
Ahead of Apple's Jan. 27 FQ1 report, Jefferies' Peter Misek (Buy) has raised his FQ1 estimates on expectations of more favorable 5S:5C mix. Misek also notes his Apple Supplier Tracker (covers Taiwanese companies receiving over 40% of their sales from Apple) only saw a 1.5% revenue drop in December, which is better than the 5% drop seen a year ago.

iPhone/iPad power management IC supplier Dialog Semi (DLGNF), which receives over 70% of its sales from Apple (AAPL +1.2%), has reported preliminary Q4 revenue of $352M (+31% Y/Y). That handily beats prior guidance of $310M, which itself was above a previous forecast of $270M-$295M. Shares rose 7.4% in Frankfurt.
Apple is trading higher following Dialog's announcement, as is Cirrus Logic (CRUS +2.8%), a chipmaker just as dependent on Apple as Dialog.
Dialog's numbers are overshadowing a downbeat note from Cleveland Research regarding early China Mobile (CHL -0.8%) iPhone demand. Cleveland says its checks point to disappointing China Mobile pre-registrations, and lead it to think the carrier will sell only 10M iPhones in 2014 (below peer estimates of 15M-30M).

Wedge Partners has also provided cautious commentary about China Mobile's iPhone pre-registrations. The world's biggest carrier begins selling the iPhone on Friday.
|Jan. 9, 2014, 7:00 PM|Apple roundup: Bigger iPhones, carrier subsidies, U.S. Mac sales


Two months after Bloomberg reported Apple (AAPL) is working on 4.7" and 5.5" iPhones, Cantor's Brian White says his checks indicate 4.7" and 5.5" iPhones could be on tap. He adds the phones might see staggered launches.
Also, Chinese site CTech has posted images of what it claims is the frame for a 4.7" iPhone 6.
More than a few analysts, investors, and writers have been urging Apple to launch bigger phones (could potentially have higher ASPs), and thereby cater to the hundreds of millions of smartphone users who prefer larger screen sizes.
Though showing no signs of doing away with traditional phone subsidies (T-Mobile excepted), U.S. carriers continue to roll out plans that offer discounts for doing without them. AT&T has discounted its shared data plans for unsubsidized users, and is offering an extra $200 in credit to switching T-Mobile users who forgo subsidies; Sprint is offering substantial group discounts to unsubsidized phone buyers; and T-Mobile (already relying on payment plans in lieu of subsidies) is now offering up to $650 in credit to users switching from other carriers.
Apple and Samsung (SSNLF, SSNGY), as the dominant high-end U.S. smartphone suppliers (and thus the biggest subsidy beneficiaries), have the most at risk from any major decline in subsidized phone purchases.

Gartner and IDC have provided very different figures for Q4 U.S. Mac sales, which benefited from a MacBook/iMac refresh. Gartner thinks they rose 28% Y/Y to 2.2M, leaving Apple with a 13.7% U.S. PC share (+380 bps Y/Y). But IDC thinks they fell 3%, and assigns Apple a 10.9% U.S. PC share (flat Y/Y).

The report comes amid efforts in the U.K. and elsewhere to stop multinational corporations from exploiting what one British legislator described as a "tax bonanza" by using low-tax jurisdictions such as Ireland, Switzerland and Luxembourg to keep their payments at minimal levels. |Jan. 2, 2014, 11:26 AM|Cantor's White calls Apple, Splunk, Tableau, Juniper his top 2014 picks


Cantor's Brian White, who once placed an $1,111 PT on Apple (AAPL -1.2%) and has provided volumes of bullish commentary on the company over the years, has named it his top 2014 large-cap pick.
White declares Apple's valuation (just 9x his calendar 2014 EPS estimate exc. cash) "remains depressed," and predicts "new product innovations" will help it return to growth after posting its first EPS declines in a decade. He also expects Apple, which opposes Carl Icahn's buyback proposal but says it's still weighing cash-return options, to return more cash to shareholders in 2014.
White has respectively named machine data analytics software vendor Splunk (SPLK +4.7%) and analytics/data visualization software firm Tableau (DATA) his top IT software and emerging tech picks. Both fast-growing/richly-valued names are expected to benefit from big data-related momentum.
Juniper (JNPR +0.2%) is named White's top contrarian pick. He likes the networking/security hardware vendor's valuation (11.3x his 2014 EPS estimate exc. cash), improving cost structure, and new product launches, and the potential for "shareholder-enhancing activities." Juniper doesn't currently pay a dividend, and has nearly $3B in net cash/investments to finance new buybacks.

|Jan. 2, 2014, 7:39 AM|Apple downgraded at Wells over margin concern


"Our bullish thesis on Apple had been predicated on the expectation for gross margin expansion driven by the 5s cycle," says analyst Maynard Um, cutting Apple (AAPL) to Hold with the price target remaining in the $536-$581 range. "While we still have conviction in the gross margin thesis (and the potential for iPad/iPhone unit upside), we believe this may be largely embedded into the valuation."
Along with margins, Um is also concerned about limited market opportunity in Apple's existing product lines, and a shift in the balance of power from handset vendors back to wireless providers.
Shooting back, Jay Yarow says he believes Apple has long-term contracts with carriers, and what's commonly known as a "subsidy" to entice buyers to purchase iPhones is really a loan that is paid back as part of the monthly service cost.
Um isn't all negative, seeing positive 2014 catalysts like the iPhone 6, the iBeacon, the iWatch, and the chance for boosted capital returns.

 Apple (AAPL) yesterday said it has never worked with the National Security Agency to allow the latter to insert a spyware program called "DROPOUTJEEP" into iPhones. "We have been unaware of this alleged NSA program targeting our products," Apple said. The company was responding to allegations from researcher Jacob Appelbaum that the NSA used the software to collect information from text messages, contact lists, voicemails and location data. DROPOUTJEEP could also activate the device's microphones and camera. Appelbaum cited leaked documents from 2008 to support his claims. Appelbaum's assertions came after Der Spiegel reported that the NSA had targeted products from U.S. tech companies such as Cisco (CSCO) and Dell. |Dec. 30, 2013, 6:26 PM|Wedge Partners offers cautious China Mobile iPhone estimates


After tracking sales at Chinese e-commerce sites and regional Apple (AAPL) distributors, as well as talking with Chinese contacts, Wedge Partners' Jun Zhang believes China Mobile took ~100K iPhone 5S pre-registrations over the first two days of availability, and that China Mobile pre-registrations from "open channels" such as e-commerce sites and Apple's stores totaled ~150K.
Those figures compare with 270K initial 5S pre-registrations by China Unicom and Telecom in September, and 400K-500K Unicom/Telecom pre-registrations via "open channels."
Taking into account China Mobile-related activity, along with its impact on other channels, Zhang estimates total Chinese iPhone sales are now on a 2.7M-2.8M/month run rate, and will be on a 2.8M-2.9M/month run rate in Q1. That's in-line with a prior forecast for 34M-35M 2014 Chinese iPhone sales, up just slightly from 2013's 33M.
By contrast, some peers have estimated China Mobile will single-handedly produce an extra 20M+ iPhone sales in 2014. It's worth noting Wedge has been conservative with its iPhone forecasts for some time.

However, the Apple (AAPL) CEO gave up 7,100 restricted stock units, due to a fall in the company's shares price. CFO Peter Oppenheimer earned $2.63M and Eddy Cue, who's in charge of iTunes, $2.65M. Jeff Williams, the head of Apple's supply chain, earned $2.63M. All three have taken home much less than last year, when they received restricted stock units. |Dec. 27, 2013, 6:10 PM|Apple urges shareholders vote against Icahn buyback proposal


In its proxy filing for its Feb. 28 annual meeting, Apple (AAPL) urges shareholders vote against Carl Icahn's Prop. 10, a "non-binding advisory resolution" calling for Apple to spend at least $50B on buybacks in FY14 (ends Sep. '14).
Apple defends itself by stating competitive conditions and the company's pace of innovation "require unprecedented investment, flexibility and access to resources."
At the same time, Apple says its board and management are "thoughtfully considering options for returning additional cash to shareholders and are currently seeking input from shareholders as part of the Company’s regular review." Tim Cook stated in October Apple would hold off on making new capital allocation decisions until early 2014.
Icahn, who owns over $2.5B worth of Apple shares (less than a 1% stake), has said he would "test the waters" regarding a proxy fight if his calls for a bigger buyback were ignored.
RBC estimated in August Apple could boost its FY14 EPS by $4 by raising $55B in debt to finance additional buybacks.

A Turkish site reports (translation) Tim Cook and other Apple (AAPL -0.4%) execs will meet with the Turkish government in February regarding a 4-year education initiative that could involve 13M+ tablet purchases, and have a price tag of $3B-$4B.
Apple VP John Couch met with Turkish President Abdullah Gul back in February, reportedly about a deal to supply up to 15M iPads.

Bloomberg reports the Rockstar Consortium (consists of Apple, Microsoft, and other tech companies) is looking to sell some of the Nortel patents it acquired for $4.5B in 2011. Sources state Rockstar, which has been trying to monetize its IP via licensing deals, has had little success landing major deals. The consortium recently sued Google, Samsung, and others.
Ahead of the start of China Mobile's iPhone sales (pre-registrations begin tomorrow), Wedge Partners reports the iPhone 5C has fallen out of a list of the 20 bestselling Chinese smartphones. The 5S has dropped one spot to #3.
The report follows one from research firm Counterpoint estimating that Apple's Chinese smartphone share rose to 12% in October from a mere 3% in September, following the 5S/5C launches.

Tim Cook in a holiday memo to employees: "We have a lot to look forward to in 2014, including some big plans that we think customers are going to love." The remarks come as fresh rumors (I, II) about the 2014 arrival of an iWatch and larger iPhones and iPads continue to arrive.

A source close to Apple's (AAPL +3.1%) M&A process tells 9to5 Mac Apple has acquired BroadMap, a startup that provides a variety of tools for creating maps, as well as aggregating, analyzing, and managing mapping/location data.
9to5 Mac observes BroadMap CEO Daniel Perrone's LinkedIn page says his company was acquired by a "Fortune 5" firm to "support their digital mapping efforts," and that nearly every BroadMap exec is now an Apple employee (according to their LinkedIn pages).
Meanwhile, sources tell the site the majority of employees once working for startup Catch are now working for Apple. Catch developed an online/mobile note-taking app that competed against the wildly popular Evernote.
Catch had 3.5M users before being acquired by an unnamed buyer over the summer. 9to5 Mac points out the startup's apps and services could complement both Siri (voice-based note-taking and reminders) and iCloud.
Apple has already made a string of mapping-related acquisitions, as it makes an all-out push to improve Apple Maps' quality following a very rough 2012 debut. The acquisition list includes HopStop, Embark, Locationary, and WiFiSlam.

"While the China Mobile announcement had long been anticipated, we believe the official announcement, and the consequent certainty, should be viewed as a positive," says Wells' Maynard Um. He thinks there's upside to his team's December quarter iPhone units estimate of 54.8M, and he's comfortable his 42.8M prediction for the March quarter, "which implicitly includes some China Mobile units."
Apple's (AAPL) price target is hiked to $650 from $600 at Stifel, which sees incremental EPS from the deal in the $4-$8 range.

|Dec. 22, 2013, 5:33 PM|Apple strikes iPhone deal with China Mobile, sales start on Jan. 17


It finally happens: Apple (AAPL) announces it has entered into a multi-year deal with China Mobile (CHL) to offer the iPhone to China Mobile's 760M subs. The iPhone 5S and 5C will be available via China Mobile's retail network, as well as Apple's Chinese stores, on Jan. 17. Pre-registrations start on Christmas. (PR)
Importantly, the phones will work on both China Mobile's new 4G TD-LTE network (just coming out of trial mode), and its existing 3G TD-SCDMA network. Either network would offer a major speed improvement for the tens of millions of existing China Mobile iPhone users currently forced to rely on 2G connections, provided they upgrade.
Analyst estimates for incremental first-year iPhone sales have ranged from less than 10M to as many as 24M, and estimates for the 2014 EPS benefit have often been in the $2-$4 range.
While China Mobile's giant subscriber base and retail reach translate into a major growth opportunity, its low ARPU and the popularity of cheap and large Android phones in China will act as headwinds. Whereas the iPhone 5C starts at an unsubsidized price of ~$735 in China, app analytics firm Umeng estimates Chinese Android phone sales carry an average unsubsidized price of just $233.

Though Dec. 18 is set to come and go without a much-anticipated China Mobile (CHL +1.6%) iPhone deal arriving, the sell-side still sees the issue as merely one of timing.

Wells Fargo notes CHL's management recently said the carrier already has as many as 50M iPhones on its network, and thinks another 15M could be added in 2014.

BMO observes CHL is looking to sell 100M 4G phones in total next year - that's a positive for Qualcomm (QCOM), provided regulators don't get in its way - and wonders if Apple (AAPL -0.8%) wants to have a separate iPhone announcement, rather than take part in a broader CHL service launch event (such as today's)

Wedge Partners is a little more cautious: While believing a China Mobile deal could happen in Q1 and pointing out some CHL branches have already begun selling unsubsidized iPhones, it thinks the world's biggest carrier might not begin promoting the iPhone until 2H. The firm expects total Chinese iPhone sales will only rise to 34M-35M in 2014 from 33M in 2013.

China Mobile's iPhone statement and contract manufacturer Jabil's (JBL - shares -20.6% premarket) weak February quarter guidance are pressuring Apple (AAPL) shares in premarket trading.
Jabil, which received 19% of its FY13 (ended Aug. '13) sales from Apple and has strong iPhone 5C exposure, is guiding for a 25% Y/Y sales drop in its diversified manufacturing services segment (DMS), which provides iPhone casings.
On its CC (transcript), Jabil stated it saw unexpected "demand changes" from a DMS customer, but insisted the impact will be temporary, and that it will "reallocate assets and resources to different revenue streams for the same customer over the next 2 to 3 quarters."

Citi (Neutral) believes Apple accounts for ~50% of DMS' revenue, and thinks Jabil's guidance is indicative of a major drop in iPhone production. The firm believes its forecast for 38M March quarter iPhone sales is at risk.
Jefferies (Buy) is less concerned, arguing the guidance is "due mainly to a mix shift from the 5C to the 5S." There have already been many reports of production being shifted to the higher-ASP 5S from the 5C.

NPD estimates U.S. Mac sales, depressed a year ago by shortages for the next-gen iMac, rose 29% Y/Y over the first two months of Q4. Apple (AAPL), whose Mac sales fell 15% Y/Y in the Sep. quarter, introduced new retina MacBook Pros in October.

AdWeek reports Apple is pushing its iAd team to selling iTunes Radio ad inventory, and is building a real-time bidding exchange to help sell in-app ads. The latter move could help Apple reach a broader swath of ad buyers as it faces off against Google, Twitter's MoPub, Millennial Media (MM) and other mobile ad rivals, as well as tap into a white-hot RTB market.
Apple has obtained a patent for a PC architecture that would rely on an advanced projector to display images instead of a monitor. To overcome the image quality issues associated with existing projector solutions, Apple's system would project images at extreme angles and use multiple sensors to optimize the projector's output.
German iPhone/iPad power management IC supplier Dialog Semi (DLGNF), believed to receive ~70% of its sales from Apple, has pre-announced a strong Q4. Citing mobile strength, Dialog now expects Q4 revenue of at least $310M, above prior guidance of $270M-$295M.

After talking with company management last week, JMP analyst Alex Gauna says he didn’t fully appreciate the revenue ramp from OLED's green host and emitter technology it will get from Samsung's Galaxy S4 and Note 3, and it will not have the inventory overhang it suffered from last year.

OpenTable (OPEN -4.1%) investors appear nervous about the patent application. However, taking share from OpenTable in the face of the restaurant reservation leader's huge network effect would be an uphill battle, especially if (as one would expect) Apple's offering is only available on mobile devices to iOS users.

A company rep confirms 4G pre-orders will start on Thursday, and that services will launch on Dec. 18 (the day of CHL's 4G partner event).
CHL had previously said it was still negotiating with Apple regarding iPhone sales. Analysts have estimated a deal could boost Apple's 2014 EPS by $2-$4 (or perhaps ~5-10%), as they balance CHL's enormous customer base and sales reach with its relatively low ARPUs and surging Chinese demand for cheaper/larger smartphones.

Forrester estimates that the disclosures could cost the U.S. cloud computing industry $180B by 2016.

Following the WSJ's report about a China Mobile (CHL -0.3%) deal, Apple (AAPL +0.9%) is up 27% from its mid-September low, and (after falling hard to start the year) up 7% YTD.
The gains come even though China Mobile has responded to the WSJ's report by stating it's "still negotiating with Apple." The world's biggest carrier has long been rumored to be driving a hard bargain with Apple, which itself has plenty of experience on that front.
As is their custom, analysts have been firing up their spreadsheets to estimate the impact of a China Mobile deal. Uber-bull Brian White thinks the deal could yield 20M-24M additional iPhone sales in 2014, boosting EPS by $4. Gene Munster is a little more cautious, forecasting 17M 2014 sales, as is Pac Crest's Andy Hargreaves, who sees only a $2 2014 EPS boost.
Munster notes that while 16GB iPhone 5S and 5C respectively cost $846 and $718 unsubsidized in China, China Mobile has an estimated unsubsidized smartphone ASP of $270 (Verizon, by contrast, is at $449). The rising popularity of large-screen smartphones in China could also act as a headwind (at least until Apple launches one of its own).

As a "precatory" proposal, the resolution won't be binding even if a majority of Apple shareholder votes are cast in favor of it.
Meanwhile, Time has published an Icahn cover story that focuses on his Apple efforts. Icahn tells the magazine he filed his proposal on Nov. 26 (thus making it eligible to be voted on at next year's shareholder meeting), and that he remains a supporter of Tim Cook.

As analysts and pundits mull Apple's (AAPL -0.6%) surprising purchase of Twitter analytics startup Topsy, plenty of attention has been given to Topsy's advanced search tools, which many consider to be better than Twitter's (TWTR +5%) on-site search capabilities.

Azeem Azhar, the founder of fellow social analytics firm PeerIndex, thinks Topsy could end up acting as "the search layer for iOS," indexing both social media content and "the best bits of the Web that power Siri and Apple Maps." He points out doing so would reduce (but not eliminate) Apple's dependence on Google.

TechCrunch, meanwhile, thinks Topsy's search tech and ability to gauge consumer sentiment could improve the quality of the App Store and iTunes' search and recommendation engines. And Gene Munster sees Topsy potentially improving Siri and Maps by integrating data related to current events and trending topics.
Separately, AllThingsD reports Twitter, which is rallying today along with other Internet momentum names, considered buying Topsy on multiple occasions, out of interest in its search tools. But the microblogging giant ultimately held off, something sources think stems from Twitter's belief it could build some of Topsy's tools on its own.

Apple (AAPL) confirms it has acquired Topsy, a provider of search/analytics tools used by companies to monitor and analyze Twitter (TWTR) commentary from millions of users, and thereby gauge consumer sentiment. Sources tell the WSJ the purchase price was above $200M.
As always, Apple is refusing to comment on its post-acquisition plans. The WSJ notes Topsy, one of the few firms to gain licensed access to Twitter's full data "firehose," could bolster iAd, by providing advertisers with real-time data about trending Twitter subjects. It could also help Apple optimize and provide recommendations for various Internet services.
There has already been plenty of M&A activity (I, II) in the social media marketing software/services space, as companies look to better serve companies directing a growing portion of their digital ad spend towards Facebook, Twitter, and other social platforms. However, most of it has come from enterprise software vendors such as Salesforce, Oracle, and IBM.
The purchase highlights the value being placed on Twitter's user data, and the insights that could potentially be gleaned from it. Twitter generated $47.3M (11% of total revenue) from data licensing sales over the first nine months of 2013, +36% Y/Y.

IBM estimates mobile devices accounted for 25.8% of U.S. Thanksgiving e-commerce sales (up 49% Y/Y), and have accounted for 21.5% of Black Friday e-commerce sales thus far.
Given mobile accounted for an even larger share of e-commerce traffic (42.6% and 37%, respectively), its conversation rates still notably lag PC levels. But the weakness entirely lies with smartphones (9% of Thanksgiving sales vs. 26.6% of traffic) rather than tablets (16.5% vs. 15.3%).
Google (GOOG -0.3%), which has been trying to strengthen its tablet search ad prices via Enhanced Campaigns (requires joint PC/tablet ad campaigns), is probably happy to see that.
On the other hand, Google is probably less happy to see that Android accounted for only 12% of of e-commerce traffic and 4.6% of sales, compared with 30% and 21% for iOS (AAPL). Monetization figures such as those are a key reason why many developers still write for iOS first, in spite of Android's burgeoning market share lead.
Meanwhile, PayPal (EBAY +2.7%) says its mobile payment volumes rose 114.7% Y/Y on Thanksgiving, and that mobile shopping activity rose 91%. The online payments giant has already predicted its 2013 mobile payments will reach $20B, up from a 2012 level of $14B.

Wal-mart says it sold 1.4M tablets overall on Thanksgiving, and that the iPad Mini (bundled with a $100 Wal-mart gift card) was a top seller. eBay says it was selling iPads at a rate of one unit per second as of midnight.
Meanwhile, Target offered $100 gift cards to iPad Air buyers, and Best Buy offered $50 and $100 discounts, respectively, for the Air and iPad 2. Today, Apple's online store is offering gift card promos for iPads, MacBooks, and other hardware.
Even as global tablet shipments surged, Apple's iPad sales fell 13% Y/Y in the Sep. quarter, and 27% in the June quarter. Apple is counting on its iPad refreshes to reverse the trend in the Dec. quarter, albeit while maintaining its premium pricing strategy in the face of strong competition from much cheaper Android tablets.

The WSJ reports Foxconn "has been running its factories around the clock" to produce the iPhone 5S (AAPL +1.9%), an action that has (as noted by Gene Munster yesterday) lowered 5S order shipping times to 3-5 business days.
A Foxconn facility in Zhengzhou, China is said to have ~300K workers dedicated solely to making the 5S and various components for it. A company exec says Foxconn's 5S production is at a record level of 500K units/day (run rate of 45M+ units/quarter).

The WSJ, DisplaySearch, and Digitimes have all previously reported of rising 5S and falling 5C production in Q4.

Digitimes reports Apple has ramped its November retina iPad Mini production orders to 4M, as component supply constraints that have hampered production thus far get removed.
Apple's U.S. online store is currently showing a shipping time of 5-10 business days for all retina Mini models.
Meanwhile, hopes continue to grow that China Mobile's (CHL +1.5%) Dec. 18 4G launch event (previous) will feature an iPhone announcement. "Industry insiders" tell state press agency Xinhua an iPhone launch will occur at the event.

Apple (AAPL +1.8%) has made new November highs, and is closing on its October peak of $539 (made right after the FQ4 report). Shares are still nearly unchanged YTD in a year that has seen the Nasdaq rise over 30%.

Gene Munster is once more reporting of improving iPhone 5S supplies (previous): Shipping times have improved to 3-5 days from 2-3 weeks, and checks at 60 U.S. Apple Stores indicated 90% of SKUs were in stock.
Separately, Digitimes' Taiwanese component supplier sources report iPhone 5C chip orders are expected to rise again in calendar Q1, following Q4 declines. If true, that's a positive for Apple-dependent chipmakers such as Cirrus Logic (CRUS +1.6%), Avago (AVGO +1.2%), and TriQuint (TQNT +2.8%).
Digitimes and others have reported of major 5C production cuts, as sales of the plastic-shelled iPhone soundly trail those of the flagship 5S.

Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), and AIG are the most popular (long) holdings of hedge funds, according to Goldman's latest hedge fund monitor, which analyzed the positions of 783 hedge funds with $1.7T of gross assets. Hedge fund holdings of AIG, however, account for 14 of the company's float compared to negligible amounts for Apple and Google.
The 20 most concentrated hedge fund holdings as defined by the percent of equity cap owned by the funds has consistently been a significant outperformer, according to Goldman. In order: AN, STZ, JCP, FDO, THC, HRB, BEAM, MU, NWSA, VRSN, CBG, NFLX, GT, TSO, ETFC, MSI, WPX, WYN, HES, CCI. The top 20 last quarter is here.
Overall, the studied hedge funds' performance leaves a bit to be desired, with average return of 6% YTD. Fewer than 5% outperformed the S&P 500, and 20% of funds posted an absolute loss.

A week after multiple reports emerged of advanced buyout talks, Apple (AAPL) has confirmed the acquisition of Israeli motion sensor tech developer PrimeSense. AllThingsD reports the price tag is ~$360M.
PrimeSense's motion-sensing chips, software, and IP powered the original Xbox Kinect (but not its successor), and could potentially be used in future Apple living room and mobile hardware. True to form, Apple is staying tight-lipped about its specific plans for the startup's products.
Over the last two years, Apple has stepped up the pace at which it's buying component vendors. In addition to PrimeSense, the company has acquired flash controller chip vendor Anobit (bought for a reported $500M), fingerprint sensor developer AuthenTec (bought for $356M and used to create the iPhone 5S' fingerprint sensor), and low-power Bluetooth chipmaker Passif Semi (bought for an unknown sum).

It's a nice win for Apple (AAPL +1.1%) as a jury awards it $290M in its patent damages retrial with Samsung (SSNLF, SSNGY). Apple had asked for $380M, while Samsung argued it owed $52M.The award comes on top of the $598.9M granted to Apple in its 2012 infringement suit against Samsung. The jury in that trial had originally awarded Apple $1.05B, but Judge Koh later reduced the figure, arguing the jury had miscalculated how much Samsung owed.Like the original trial, the retrial took place in San Jose, next door to Apple's hometown of Cupertino.|Nov. 21, 2013, 2:56 PM|Einhorn praises Apple again, makes bull case for Micron


Apple's (AAPL +0.9%) software ecosystem makes its hardware business akin to a recurring revenue stream, and very different from those of fallen mobile giants such as Motorola and BlackBerry, suggests David Einhorn, once more making a bull case for the company. He backs up his argument by pointing to Apple's ~90% customer repurchase rate.
Einhorn, who called on Apple to make a preferred stock distribution earlier this year (he backed off after the company added $50B to its buyback plan), refuses to pass judgment on Carl Icahn's call for another $150B in buybacks - "Carl’s view is not particularly important because I don’t know what Carl’s thinking" - but does say "it makes sense for Apple to maintain a very good, strong cushion, so they can continue to innovate even if the market hits a bad cycle."
Einhorn's Greenlight Capital owned 2.4M Apple shares at the end of Q3. In his Q3 investor letter, he talked up Apple's e-commerce ops (iTunes/App Store), noting they amount to a $16B/year and growing business.
As for Micron (MU +6.5%), which Einhorn just disclosed a position in, Einhorn says he's a fan of companies in consolidating industries, and notes "there's an enormous change going on" in the DRAM industry as it consolidates around Micron, Samsung, and SK Hynix. Others have made similar arguments.
|Nov. 21, 2013, 9:48 AM|Apple roundup: China Mobile, Samsung trial, procurement, iPhone 6 pricing


China Mobile (CHL) says it will unveil a new mobile service brand on Dec. 18, during the company's 4G partners conference. That's fueling hopes the world's largest carrier (700M+ subs) will make its long-expected iPhone (AAPL) launch announcement.
The WSJ has previously reported Apple is preparing to ship iPhones to China Mobile, and Chinese regulators have certified the iPhone for use on the carrier's 3G and 4G networks. A China Mobile launch is crucial to Apple's efforts to halt Chinese smartphone share losses to cheaper Android phones.
A USPTO examiner has invalidated Apple's '915 patent, which covers pinch-to-zoom and scrolling UI features. Though Apple will doubtlessly appeal, Samsung has filed an emergency motion to halt its damages retrial (previous) against Apple, since the '915 patent was the only one asserted in Apple's California suit for which it was claiming lost profits.

Digitimes reports Apple is taking control of component procurement from its contract manufacturers. If true, that suggests Apple sees room to improve its margins by handling procurement on its own.

Susquehanna notes a large-screen iPhone 6 (widely expected to launch in 2014) could carry a price premium (the firm estimates $50-$100), and thereby allow Apple to halt recent iPhone ASP declines. The current pricing for Samsung's Galaxy Note 3 phablet (AT&T and Verizon sell it for a subsidized $300) lends credence to that argument.
|Nov. 18, 2013, 11:55 AM|New reports of 5C/5S order shifts; Apple can pursue Samsung injunction



Digitimes reports Foxconn, said to be responsible for 30% of iPhone 5C (AAPL -0.4%) production, is stopping 5C production a northern China factory, and will shift capacity to iPhone 5S production.
The site also reports Apple respectively cut its 5C orders to Foxconn and Pegatron (said to be responsible for the 70% of 5C output) by "nearly one-third" and 20% a month ago due to "unsatisfactory sales."
The report comes shortly after Chinese site C Technology, which provided one of the first reports of a 5C order cut, stated Pegatron has cut 5C production to just 80K units/day from 320K/day in October.
Analytics firm Fiksu reports global 5S usage outpaces 5C usage by more than a 3:1 margin (6.9% of all iPhone usage vs. 2.2%). Localytics' activation data has also indicated 5S sales soundly outpace 5C sales.
Meanwhile, a U.S. federal appeals court has ruled Apple can pursue an injunction against Samsung (SSNLF, SSNGY) products ruled to be infringing the company's IP in last year's California suit. Judge Lucy Koh, who presided over the CA suit, ruled last December Apple hadn't proven the infringed patents drove Samsung's product sales. The infringement rulings were tied to older/largely outdated Samsung devices.

|Nov. 18, 2013, 8:07 AM|Apple reportedly set to buy gesture recognition sensor firm



Calcalist reports Apple (AAPL) has struck a deal (translation) to acquire PrimeSense, an Israeli gesture recognition tech developer, for $345M. AllThingsD reports the deal, while expected to close by week's end, isn't yet finished. The site adds the price "could be slightly higher than [Calcalist] reported, on the order of $20 million more."

PrimeSense's technology (it includes an SoC, software, and depth-sensing IP)  powers the Xbox's Kinect sensor, but not the second-gen Kinect (bundled with the Xbox One). The company has also a sensor solution (known as Capri) meant for smartphones/tablets and other small-form-factor devices. Thus, PrimeSense's offerings could potentially be used not only in an iTV or next-gen Apple TV, but also in future Macs and iPhones/iPads.
Apple was reported to be interested in PrimeSense back in July. Intel bought fellow Israeli gesture recognition tech firm Omek Interactive around the same time, and Google bought hand gesture recognition software startup Flutter a couple months later. Meanwhile, Samsung has been working on adding gesture-recognition support to both its TVs and mobile devices, and startup Leap Motion has begun selling a PC sensor with modest success.

 Samsung (SSNLF, SSNGY) widened its lead over Apple (AAPL) in the smartphone market in Q3, with Gartner estimating that Samsung sold 80.36M smartphones vs 55M a year earlier and Apple 30.33M vs 24.62M. The Korean company's market share held steady at 32.1% while Apple's dropped to 12.1% from 14.3%. Overall, the number of smartphones sold increased to 250.2M from 171.65M. By operating system, Google's (GOOG) Android accounted for 205M devices, or 81.9% of the market, Apple's iOS 30.33M, or 12.1%, and Microsoft's (MSFT) Windows 8.9M, or 3.6%. The total number of cellular phones sold rose to 455.6M from 431M. Samsung was in first place with 117M units and Nokia (NOK) second with 63M.

Canaccord's Mike Walkley is providing more positive survey data (previous) regarding iPhone 5S (AAPL +1.3%) sales: His Oct./Nov. surveys indicate the 5S was "by far the top selling smartphone at all four tier-1 U.S. carriers and at most channels where the smartphone launched globally."
Walkley also reports 5C sales are "steady," and that silver/space grey 5S supplies were "much improved" from September levels, with the 16GB and 32GB models available at many U.S. carrier stores by early November. The gold 5S is said to still be in short supply.
Likewise, Gene Munster, who more than once reported of limited 5S supplies at U.S. stores, now says 5S supplies are nearing an inflection point. On the other hand, iPad Air supplies are believed to be tightening.

Yesterday: Apple roundup
|Nov. 13, 2013, 1:04 PM|Apple roundup: tax probe, iWatch, retina Mini supplies, iTV, Distimo, IDC


The Italian government is investigating Apple (AAPL +0.2%) for allegedly hiding €1B ($1.34B) from local tax authorities. The investigation comes amid an ongoing EU probe into the tax deals provided by Ireland, Luxembourg, and The Netherlands to Apple and others, and six months after Tim Cook testified at a Senate hearing regarding Apple's tax payments on overseas profits.
DisplaySearch's Tony Hsieh reports Apple plans to sell two iWatch models: a version with a 1.7" display for men, and a version with a 1.3" display for women. Past reports have stated multiple iWatch prototypes featuring different display sizes exist.
KGI's well-connected Ming-Chi Kuo predicts Dec. quarter retina iPad Mini shipments will only total 2.2M due to low supplies; March quarter shipments are expected to hit 4.5M. Apple is now taking retina Mini orders through its online store, but retail store buyers have to use its Personal Pickup service for now.

Kuo also reports a new Apple TV set-top featuring an A7 CPU will launch in 2014 (8.2M 2014 shipments are forecast), but doesn't expect an iTV to arrive before late-2015 or early-2016 "at the earliest." Gene Munster, whose iTV predictions have been off the mark more than a few times, is now predicting a 2014 launch.

Distimo estimates the App Store still has a 64%/36% revenue edge over Google Play. Though down from May's 71%/29%, that figure is still eye-opening given IDC estimates Android phones by more than 6:1 in Q3 (81% share vs. 12.9%).
Superior monetization, along with lower R&D costs, are key reasons why many developers still write for iOS first and Android second, in spite of a growing market share gap.
|Nov. 12, 2013, 7:40 AM|Apple begins selling retina iPad Mini


Three weeks after Apple (AAPL) unveiled the retina iPad Mini, the tablet is available for purchase at Apple's online store. 16GB and 32GB Wi-Fi-only models are showing shipping times of 1-3 business days; other models are at 5-10 business days. The retina Mini had been expected to go on sale on Nov. 22, following a Target leak indicating as much.
Two issues that will be closely watched: 1) Supply constraints. There have been multiple reports stating early Mini supplies will be limited due to display shortages, and Tim Cook admitted on the FQ4 CC it isn't clear if Apple will be able to meet Dec. quarter demand. 2) How much the Mini's premium pricing - the device starts at $399 at a time when the Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire HDX, each of which also have high-res displays, start at $229 - will affect sales.
The iPad Air went on sale on Nov. 1. Initial reviews and activation/usage data have been positive.

Update: Apple has made an official announcement.

Albany's Times Union reports GlobalFoundries (the world's #2 chip foundry) is getting set to produce Apple's (AAPL -0.3%) A-series processors at a Malta, NY fab, in partnership with current manufacturer Samsung. TSMC (TSM -1.5%), which has been expected to handle a growing share of A-series production, might not be happy to hear that.

DisplaySearch, which previously suggested an iTV could arrive in 2014, now reports (citing TV industry supply chain sources) Apple's TV plans "have been put on hold again." Many an Apple analyst/observer has inaccurately forecast a pending iTV launch in recent years.

Pac Crest's checks lead it to think iPhone sales are roughly flat Y/Y, and that inventories are a little higher due to the 5C. The firm's tone is more subdued than that seen in many recent analyst reports. Meanwhile, BMO has lowered its PT to $585 from $600, the firm now thinks a China Mobile iPhone launch won't happen until 1H14.
The WSJ takes a look at the iPhone's success in Japan, the one big international market where the device's popularity reaches U.S. levels. Contributing factors: A strong brand presence (aided by heavy marketing), high per capita incomes (enables subsidies exceeding U.S. levels), and a Japanese consumer bias against Korean brands such as Samsung.
Apple's Japanese sales rose 41% Y/Y in FQ4, even as sales to Greater China only rose 6%, and those to the rest of Asia-Pac fell 6%.

|Nov. 11, 2013, 12:16 PM|Icahn: Cook still studying buyback proposal



Carl Icahn tells CNBC he recently had a "good conversation" with Tim Cook, and that the Apple (AAPL -0.6%) CEO is still studying Icahn's $150B buyback proposal.
Apple has moved higher on the report, but still remains down on the day.
Three weeks ago, Icahn disclosed his Apple stake had risen to 4.7M shares (worth $2.4B), and said he would "test the waters" regarding a proxy fight  if his calls for a bigger buyback were ignored. The following week, Cook stated any changes to Apple's capital allocation plan would be announced early next year.
Apple currently has $146.8B in cash/investments on its balance sheet, but only $35.5B of that is in the U.S. Thanks to a debt offering made earlier this year to help finance its existing back efforts, long-term debt stands at $16.9B.
|Nov. 10, 2013, 11:12 AM|Apple reportedly prepping 4.7" and 5.5" iPhones with curved screens



Bloomberg reports Apple (AAPL) plans to release iPhones featuring 4.7" and 5.5" displays, as well as "glass that curves downward at the edges," in 2H14. Apple is also reportedly thinking of integrating "sensors that can distinguish heavy or light touches on the screen" in subsequent models; this suggests the inclusion of advanced haptic feedback tech.
There have been plenty of reports indicating Apple is looking to offer one or more iPhones with a larger display next year, as it tries to address soaring demand for phones with larger displays. Demand for such phones, along with a mix shift towards cheaper smartphones, has been pressuring Apple's European and Asian smartphone shares.

Samsung and LG both recently unveiled phones with curved (OLED) screens, but initial volumes have been limited. Proponents of the idea have argued a curved large-screen phone is easier to grip, and offers a greater field of view. Samsung (SSNLF, SSNGY) says it plans to offer phones with foldable displays in about two years.
The inclusion of haptic feedback tech within future iPhone would be a positive for haptic IP developer Immersion (IMMR). Immersion's shares once took off on a rumor (proven unfounded) the 3rd-gen iPad would feature haptic tech developed by Finland's Senseg.
Bloomberg's report comes as Apple gets set to buy huge volumes of sapphire from GT Advanced. While debate continues on whether enough of the exceptionally strong/scratch-resistant material will be produced in the near-term to replace traditional iPhone/iPad display cover glasses (such as Gorilla Glass), it's widely expected to do so over the long haul.
|Nov. 7, 2013, 1:00 PM|Report argues iPhone 5S uses Liquidmetal


After analyzing newly-published European Apple (AAPL) patents, Patently Apple believes the iPhone 5S makes use of Liquidmetal (LQMT).
The site points out he patents describe the use of a metal alloy for a hardware assembly resembling current iPhones, and that drawings spell out "the process of using Liquidmetal for the current iPhone with its classic metal bezel antenna."
Patently Apple also thinks a patent diagram suggests Liquidmetal could be used in a future iPad Smart Cover featuring a large window through which users can see the display.

BGR predicted the 5S will make use of Liquidmetal in July. Liquidmetal shares have generally been trading in a narrow range over the last few months, after taking off in response to BGR's report.
|Nov. 5, 2013, 12:47 PM|Apple roundup: 12.9" iPad, Air margins, Deutsche's checks, sapphire


Chinese site PadNews has joined a growing list of sources (previous) reporting a bigger iPad (AAPL -0.3%) is on the way. The site reports (translation) Foxconn is testing a 12.9" iPad, and that the tablet will launch in March '14.
The fact Apple chose to name its 5th-gen 9.7" iPad the iPad Air has already fueled speculation a larger "iPad Pro" is on tap.
After tearing down the 4G and Wi-Fi-only iPad Air units, IHS thinks the tablets carry higher margins than older iPads did at launch time. IHS estimates the cheapest Air model (16GB Wi-Fi-only, sells for $499) costs $274 to make, and thus has a 45% gross margin. The most costly model (128GB 4G, sells for $929) is believed to cost $361 to make, giving it a 61% gross margin. For reference, Apple is guiding for a total Dec. quarter gross margin of 36.5%-37.5%.

Deutsche's checks indicate channel supplies for the Air are healthy, save for the 128GB model; stronger demand for high-capacity models boosts margins/ASPs. The firm also reports iPhone 5S demand is outpacing supply in all of its carrier, online, and retail checks. Lead times remain high for gold 5S units.

Speculation is swirling about what Apple plans to do with the sapphire GT Advanced will be producing for the company at a Mesa, AZ plant to be built by Apple. Those who think the material will be used to cover iPhone/iPad displays point to the fact Apple has mulled using sapphire for this purpose before, but held off because the material couldn't be produced in sufficient volumes. Others think sapphire will only be used in an iWatch for now, given its high costs and the huge volumes needed to handle iPhone/iPad production needs.

 Aided by strong sales of the low-end Lumia 520, Windows Phone's (MSFT) smartphone share in the EU5 rose to 9.8% in the July-September timeframe, per Kantar Worldpanel's latest estimates.That's up from 9.2% in the June-August timeframe, and just 4.6% a year ago. Moreover, Microsoft's OS now claims a double-digit share of U.K., French, and Italian smartphone sales. Elsewhere, progress is slower. Kantar estimates WP still only has a 4.6% share in the U.S. (+190 bps Y/Y), a 2.5% share in China, and a 5.8% share in Latin America. Nokia's most recent Lumia launches could provide a lift. In what has been a general trend this year, the iPhone (AAPL) picked up share in the U.S. (+130 bps to 35.9%), and lost share in the EU5 (-230 bps to 14.6%). Also, the iPhone's Chinese share is believed to have fallen 640 bps Y/Y to 13.8%, and its Latin American share is believed to have risen 220 bps to 6.6%. Android (GOOG) is assigned a U.S. share of 57.3%, an EU5 share of 71.9% (+420 bps), a Chinese share of 81.1% (+1460 bps), and a Latin American share of 73.4% (+2310 bps, largely at BlackBerry/Symbian's expense). Kantar makes note of the price-sensitivity of Chinese consumers, observing some spend 70% of their monthly income to buy a new smartphone. That, in turn, leads many of them to opt for hardware from local brands who are increasingly offering Android phones with high-end specs and mid-range prices. |Nov. 4, 2013, 4:41 PM|Apple strikes sapphire furnace/supply deal with GT Advanced


The deal, announced within GT Advanced's (GTAT) Q3 report, calls on GT to supply Apple (AAPL) with sapphire via furnaces the former company will own/operate at an Arizona facility owned by the latter.
GT plans to employ 700+ people at the facility, and Apple will be providing GT with a $578M prepayment to assist with the efforts. GT will reimburse Apple for the prepayment over five years, starting in 2015.
The magnitude of the initiative suggests Apple plans to use sapphire cover glass to protect the displays used in future iOS hardware (perhaps including 2014 iPhones/iPads). Rumors about such a move have been around for a while, heightened by Apple's use of sapphire to protect iPhone camera lenses and the iPhone 5S' home button.
Assuming Apple uses GT's sapphire with iOS hardware displays, the deal is a negative for Gorilla Glass supplier Corning (GLW), particularly since it could encourage other mobile OEMs to embrace sapphire and improve its economies of scale. Sapphire is thinner, stronger, and more scratch-resistant than current cover glass solutions such as Gorilla Glass, but is also much costlier.
On account of the Apple deal, GT has "accelerated the development of its next generation, large capacity ASF furnaces." The company expects these efforts to aid its efforts to offer next-gen furnaces to traditional customers in other market segments (LEDs, industrial manufacturing, etc.).

Update: Arizona's governor's office announces Apple will be building a new facility in Mesa, AZ. 1.3K construction jobs will be created to go with GT's 700+ manufacturing jobs. Corning is now down 1.2% AH.

Mobile ad services firm Fiksu, which monitors activity on millions of iOS devices via the apps developed by its clients, reports the iPad Air (AAPL +1.3%) "is seeing five times the usage the iPad 4 did two days after launch – and more than 3 times that of the iPad Mini."
Also: AT&T reports its weekend iPad activations were up over 3x from last year's launch weekend. Though a positive datapoint, it's worth noting Wi-Fi-only devices still make up a solid majority of iPad sales, and that AT&T's tablet subscriber adds have grown quickly this year thanks to the adoption of its Mobile Share plans, which lower the incremental cost of adding a tablet to a service plan.
The retina iPad Mini is set to launch later this month, possibly on Nov. 21.

Gene Munster spotted about 365 people in a line outside Apple's (AAPL -1.2%) flagship NYC store this morning to buy the iPad Air. That's less than the 580 spotted a year ago when the 4th-gen iPad and iPad Mini launched, but better than the Apple perma-bull feared.
Given the Mini and the 3rd-gen iPad each saw opening weekend sales of 3M while dealing with inventory constraints, Munster thinks weekend Air sales could be in the 2.5M-3.5M range, with sell-through of 1M-2M and channel fill of 1.5M.
Much as it has done with the iPhone 5C, Wal-mart is discounting the 16Gb Wi-Fi-only Air below its official retail price; the retail giant is selling the tablet for $479. Interestingly, Apple has joined Best Buy and Staples in matching Wal-mart's price cut.
The Air is launching to very good reviews, but (like the retina Mini) its pricing relative to comparable Android hardware has been criticized.

"If you can afford it, the new iPad Air is the tablet I recommend, hands down," says Walt Mossberg after reviewing Apple's (AAPL) 5th-gen 9.7" tablet. Mossberg deems the thinner/lighter Air much more comfortable to hold for long periods of time than its predecessor, and managed to wring out 12+ hours of battery life in his test (20% above a promised 10 hours).

CNET (4.5/5 stars) talks up the Air's design makeover, its improved front camera, and the "ridiculously fast" performance of its A7 CPU. But it wishes the tablet had an 802.11ac Wi-Fi radio and a fingerprint sensor.
After running benchmarks, AnandTech finds the Air's CPU performance beats that of rival Android hardware. GPU performance is also strong, but not as overwhelmingly; Nvidia's (NVDA) Shield handheld console (features a Tegra 4 processor) topped several benchmarks.
With prices well above those for comparable Android tablets (particularly for 32GB-64GB models), Apple is betting its hardware quality, brand loyalty, and unmatched tablet app ecosystem will allow it to once more post positive Y/Y iPad revenue growth following two quarters of declines.
Meanwhile, Apple has released its FY13 10-K, and used it to disclose an FY14 capex budget of $11B. That's 57% higher than the $7B budget created for FY13, and equal to 6% of estimated FY14 revenue.

Previous: IDC's Q3 tablet figures
|Oct. 30, 2013, 11:15 PM|Tablet growth slows in Q3, Apple loses more share ahead of iPad launches



IDC estimates 47.6M tablets were shipped in Q3, +7% Q/Q and +36.7% Y/Y. The Y/Y growth rate represents a major slowdown from Q2's 60% (never mind Q1's 142%), and is  below JPMorgan's forecast for 54% growth. It also puts IDC's September forecast for 227.4M 2013 shipments (+58% Y/Y) in doubt.
Apple (AAPL), which just reported 14.1M Sep. quarter iPad shipments, is assigned a 29.6% share, down from 40.2% a year earlier. In July, IDC gave Apple a 32.4% Q2 share, down all the way from 60.3% a year earlier.
A pending iPad refresh played a role in the decline - IDC expects "robust" iPad shipment growth in Q4 - but an industry mix shift towards cheap ~7" Android (GOOG) tablets (many of them from white-label OEMs) was also a major factor.
Samsung (SSNLF, SSNGY) is believed to have shipped 9.7M tablets, good for a 20.4% share (+800 bps Y/Y). IDC thinks Nexus 7 OEM Asus shipped 3.5M tablets and held a 7.4% share, and that Lenovo (LNVGY) shipped 2.3M tablets and held a 4.8% share.
IDC's numbers come two days after Strategy Analytics estimated smartphone shipments rose 45% Y/Y in Q3 to 251M. The two sets of figures suggest the smartphone market was 5.3x as large as the tablet market on a unit basis. That ratio will probably narrow in Q4, given the iPad refresh and the popularity of tablets as Christmas presents.

Though sell-side commentary on Apple's (AAPL -2.3%) FQ4 numbers was largely positive, investors decided to take profits following a 26% rally from where shares traded going into July's market-pleasing FQ3 report.
Canaccord's Mike Walkley joined the list of analysts praising Apple's numbers; he sees Apple "well-positioned" to exceed Street estimates, even though he expects "more aggressive" 5C pricing in 2014 to boost international sales. Meanwhile, Needham's Charlie Wolf gave a thumbs-up to Apple's decision to maintain premium pricing, rather than move downmarket to better compete against cheaper Android hardware.
While the sell-side dissected Apple's numbers, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is predicting new retail chief/ex-Burberry CEO Angela Ahrendts will be Apple's next CEO. Benioff declares Ahrendts "the most important hire Tim Cook has ever made."
Also: The Korea Herald reports LG Display (LPL) and Taiwan's RiTDisplay ar expected to supply flexible OLED panels for an iWatch. A month ago, a Korean site reported the iWatch will feature a flexible OLED, and that Apple is working on prototypes sporting 1.3", 1.4", and 1.5" displays.

BMO"s Keith Bachman boosts his price target to $600 from $508. He notes gross margin guidance for the December quarter could be viewed as disappointing, but the accounting change (deferred revenue on nearly $1B in hardware sales) could have up to a 100 basis point impact on margins.

There's still a significant backlog of iPhone 5S (AAPL) orders, even though supplies are rising every week, says Tim Cook on the CC. Likewise, though Cook is upbeat about FQ1 iPad sales, he says it isn't clear retina iPad Mini supplies (reportedly constrained) will match demand during the quarter.
Also: 1) Greater China sales (+6% Y/Y) benefited from an earlier Chinese iPhone launch. 2) Cook says education market sales topped $1B for the first time, and estimates Apple has a 94% tablet share in the vertical. 3) DRAM and NAND flash memory costs rose in FQ4. DRAM costs are expected to rise again in FQ1, while NAND costs are expected to be flat and other commodity costs lower.
Strategy Analytics has plugged Apple's FQ4 iPhone sales (33.8M) into its spreadsheet and released its Q3 smartphone estimates. The firm believes industry shipments rose 45% Y/Y to 251M, after rising 47% in Q2.
Apple, whose iPhone units rose 26% Y/Y, is given a 13.4% unit share, -220 bps Y/Y. Samsung (SSNLF, SSNGY) is assigned a 35% share, +210 bps, and estimated to have shipped 88.4M smartphones. Huawei (5.1%), LG (LGEIY, 4.8%), and Lenovo (LNVGY, 4.3%) round out the top-5.

Tim Cook states on Apple's (AAPL) FQ4 CC any changes to his company's capital allocation plan will be announced early next year. The comments arrive as Carl Icahn clamors for a new $150B buyback.
Cook also discloses Apple made 15 acquisitions in FY13. Only eight of those purchases have been identified thus far.
iPhone channel inventory stood at 14.3M at quarter's end, putting it at the low end of Apple's target range. iPad channel inventories were at 4.1M, in the middle of Apple's target range, while Mac inventories were below target.
Eight new Apple stores were opened in FQ4, raising the total to 416, of which 162 are outside the U.S. Apple plans to open 30 new stores in FY14, of which 2/3 will be outside the U.S.
Apple is deferring $900M+ worth of hardware revenue in FQ1 to account for the value of bundled software; gross margin would be higher otherwise. New products and a higher iPad mix are also expected to pressure FQ1 gross margin.
$35.5B of Apple's $146.8B cash/investment balance is in the U.S. The U.S. balance is down $5B Q/Q.

In Japan, where NTT DoCoMo just began carrying the iPhone, the 5S/5C already make up nearly 10% of the local iPhone base. In the U.S., the figure is 6.4%.

Anand Chandrasekher, Qualcomm's (QCOM) chief marketing officer and once the head of Intel's Atom CPU unit, has been reassigned after calling the 64-bit ARMv8 (ARMH) instruction set used by Apple's (AAPL) new A7 CPU (found in the iPhone 5S, iPad Air, and retina iPad Mini) a "gimmick."
Qualcomm, which had already declared the comments to be "inaccurate" in an attempt at damage control, says Chandrasekher is "moving to a new role leading our exploration of certain enterprise related initiatives."
Back in August, Chandrasekher drew headlines by declaring 8-core mobile processors, such as one launched by MediaTek, a "dumb" idea, given efficiency/battery life tradeoffs. But whereas MediaTek is a rival, Apple is one of Qualcomm's top clients, using its baseband modems, RF transceivers, and power management ICs (but not its app processors) in iPhones and 4G-capable iPads.
PR concerns aside, most apps won't get a performance boost from 64-bit in the near-term. But ARMv8's support for more CPU registers will benefit some performance-intensive media apps. Long-term, the ability of 64-bit CPUs to support more than 4GB of RAM make their mobile adoption inevitable.
ARM shares took off after Apple disclosed the A7 will feature ARMv8, since 64-bit CPUs carry higher royalties. Since then, Samsung has disclosed its next-gen CPUs will be 64-bit.

With a market cap of $482B, Apple is much bigger than Icahn's historical proxy war targets, and his current stake remains below 1%. However, Icahn does claim to have received significant interest from major Apple shareholders regarding a larger buyback.

Goldman's Bill Shope (Buy, $560 PT) is nudging his FY14 Apple (AAPL +0.8%) estimates higher following yesterday's iPad launches (I, II),  arguing the quality of the iPad Air and the retina Mini's price points should yield higher iPad ASPs and unit shipments.
Thanks to a mix shift towards the Mini, Apple's iPad ASP has been trending lower, and was at $437 in the June quarter.
Meanwhile, Lazard's Ed Parker is pleased with the huge incremental margins Apple continues to see on higher-capacity hardware, as well as its willingness to provide free software to get consumers to buy.
Though NAND flash prices have fallen plenty over the last three years, Apple still charges $100 more for a 32GB iPad than a similar 16GB iPad, and another $100 more for a similar 64GB model. Google and Amazon only charge $40 more for 32GB versions of the Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire HDX. Another $40 gets Amazon customers a 64GB HDX.
Not everyone buys into the wisdom of Apple's pricing strategy, which follows a Q2 for which IDC estimated the company's tablet unit share fell to 32.4% from 60.3% a year earlier.

Troy Wolverton: "You know things are out of whack when the best-priced iPad still costs $500 and Apple is offering a 2-1/2 year old model at a price that is $40 more expensive than a comparably sized -- but brand new -- Samsung tablet."

Apple plans to charge a relatively steep $399 for the 16GB Wi-Fi-only retina Mini; Google's 2nd-gen Nexus 7 and Amazon's 7" Kindle Fire HDX, both of which also have high-res displays, start at $229.
The first-gen Mini's starting price has been cut to $299 from $329. That still leaves it priced well above the $200-and-cheaper 7" Android devices that have taken a large chunk of the tablet market.
Like the iPad Air, the retina Mini begins shipping on Nov. 1. No fingerprint sensor was disclosed for either device.
New iPad Smart Covers ($39) and full-wrap covers ($79) have been shown off, but the rumored keyboard cover hasn't. Logitech (LOGI +1.2%) has ticked higher in response.

As rumored, the Air has thinner (iPad Mini-like) bezels, and contains Apple's 64-bit A7 CPU and M7 motion co-processor (both are found in the iPhone 5S). Apple claims up to 10 hours of battery life (same as the 4th-gen iPad).
Pricing is unchanged relative to 4th-gen models: a 16GB Wi-Fi-only Air goes for $499. The tablet ships on Nov. 1. The iPad 2 is being kept around, and without price cuts (it starts at $399).
Cumulative iPad sales have passed 170M, and over 475K of the App Store's 1M apps have been optimized for the iPad. There were 375K iPad-specific apps in June.
Also: Apple has updated its iLife media apps - iPhoto, iMovie, and GarageBand - as well as its iWork productivity suite. The iLife apps have joined iWork (previous) in being free to buyers of new iOS hardware. Between the free iOS apps and Mavericks, Apple is now clearly content to give away software to drive hardware sales.

Apple (AAPL -0.5%) has decided to make the just-launched Mac OS X Mavericks free to Mac owners. Microsoft (MSFT -0.8%), which charges $120 for a basic version of Windows 8.1 and $200 for a Pro version (OEMs and enterprises get discounts, and Win. 8 users can upgrade for free), has moved lower following the disclosure.
As expected, Apple is also launching new retina MaBook Pros sporting Intel (INTC -0.2%) Haswell CPUs. The 13" model starts at $1299, while the 15" model starts at $1,999; both prices are $200 below those for prior-gen models.
Aided by Haswell, the new 13" Pro is said to provide up to 9 hours of battery life, and the 15" Pro up to 8 hours. The 13" model uses an integrated Intel Iris GPU, while the 15" model can come with either an Iris Pro GPU or a discrete Nvidia (NVDA -0.8%) GeForce 750M GPU.
Also launched: the new Mac Pro, which was first discussed at WWDC. The cylindrical device uses an Intel Xeon E5 CPU and supports AMD's FirePro workstation GPUs, supports up to 1TB of flash memory and is said to take up only 1/8 as much volume as the prior-gen Mac Pro; power draw is 70% lower.

The reports follow one from a Chinese site indicating daily 5C production has been cut in half, and activation and survey data indicating the 5S is soundly outselling the 5C, whose higher-than-expected unsubsidized prices drew criticism from the start. Investors seem to be taking the news in stride on account of past reports. AAPL +0.6% premarket, following equity futures higher. Possibly helping: Canaccord's Mike Walkley has raised its PT to $580 from $560. Walkley's global survey work points to "a significantly higher sell-through mix of iPhone 5s versus 5c that should benefit near-term ASPs and margins, and he also expects a mix shift towards the regular iPad relative to the Mini, following pending refreshes. |Oct. 16, 2013, 7:43 AM|Buffett plays to his fans on CNBC

 Ireland's Finance Minister, Michael Noonan, intends to introduce a law that will prevent multinational companies registered in the country from remaining "stateless" in terms of their tax residency and avoid paying billions of dollars in taxes. The moves comes amid international criticisms of Ireland's laws, which have allowed Apple (AAPL) to pay levies of just 2% or less instead of the country's 12.5% rate. However, the legislation won't stop corporations from deploying the "Double Irish," which lets firms, including Google (GOOG) and Adobe (ADBE), use the differences in the U.S. and Irish tax codes to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions. |Oct. 15, 2013, 12:10 PM|More on Apple: Invites sent out for iPad event

 Tim Cook (AAPL +0.7%) has issued a company memo praising new retail chief/ex-Burberry CEO Angela Ahrendts. "She places the same strong emphasis as we do on the customer experience. She cares deeply about people ... she is wicked smart." Those remarks might in part be an attempt to reassure employees Ahrendts' mindset is different from that of John Browett, who alienated retail workers with a perceived bottom line-focused approach. Burberry (BBRYF.PK) shares fell 6.2% in London. French site MacG.co reports (translation) new 13" and 15" MacBook Pros will go on sale on Oct. 24 or 25, following Apple's expected Oct. 22 iPad event. It also reports the new, cylindrical, Mac Pro (previewed in June) will be available on Nov. 15. A 5th-gen iPad and iPad Mini are expected to go on sale at month's end.

KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo reports Apple (AAPL +0.6%) is planning to launch a 12" MacBook in Q2 or Q3 of next year that will "redefine laptop computing" in a manner similar to the MacBook Air. The device is said to be thinner and lighter than the Air thanks to a new clamshell design, yet still feature a retina display.
Kuo's sources also indicate Apple could launch a cheaper iMac around the same timeframe, and a 6th-gen iPad with an even higher resolution than the 2048x1536 offered by the 4th-gen model (and expected of the 5th-gen). No word on whether a rumored ~13 iPad will launch.

A CIRP survey indicates the iPhone 5S accounted for 64% of U.S. iPhone sales in September, following the 5S/5C launches. The 5C's share is placed at 27%, and the 4S' at just 9%. A year earlier, the iPhone 5 made up 68% of sales, the 4S 23%, and the iPhone 4 9%.
The survey data follows 5C estimate cuts, and a report of a 5C production cut.
U.S. shipping times for all iPhone 5S models (including the gold models, which previously was seeing huge delays) have fallen to 2-3 weeks on Apple's online store. BTIG's latest spreadsheet (previous) indicates Verizon is seeing somewhat better ship times (ranging from 18-32 days), but that Sprint's ship times remain very long.

KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo, whose supply chain scoops have often panned out, is cutting his FQ4 (Sep. quarter) iPhone 5C (AAPL +0.3%) shipment estimate by 33% to 11.4M units. He also predicts shipments will drop another 10% in FQ1 to 10.4M. However, he's unsure of the impact on total iPhone sales, since 5S and 4S demand remains strong.
Kuo's estimate cut comes a day after a Chinese site reported Apple has cut 5C production in half to 150K units/day.

Gene Munster's latest survey of 60 U.S. Apple Stores found only 6% of total 5S SKUs were available, down from 27% a week ago. Moreover, the percentage of stores having at least one SKU fell to 40% from 90%. Munster suspects the pending launch of the 5S/5C in 25 additional markets has tightened supplies.
The Financial Post reports Apple recently hosted an Ontario recruiting event aimed at poaching BlackBerry (BBRY -0.4%) engineers as the latter company gets ready to cut ~40% of its workforce.

Chinese site C Technology, which leaked iPhone 5S/5C pictures before the devices launched, reports Apple (AAPL) has cut 5C production in half to 150K units/day (translation). The reported rate implies quarterly output of ~13.7M units.
Separately, Unwired View reports the 16GB 5C is now going for $489-$539 unsubsidized on the Chinese grey market, well below an official price of $726.
Mobile analytics firm Localytics has reported the 5S' share of active iPhones dwarfs that of the 5C, whose higher-than-expected unsubsidized prices fueled criticism. Checks indicate 5S demand has been better than expected, and the WSJ reported last month gold 5S production has been raised by 1/3.
Suppliers that could be affected by a major 5C production cut, assuming the slack isn't picked up by higher 5S output: CRUS, QCOM, BRCM, SWKS, TQNT, RFMD, AVGO.

H-P's (HPQ -1.9%) market-pleasing analyst day guidance (I, II) hasn't made Jim Chanos less bearish about the IT giant. "They're talking about margins improving. I'm just hard-pressed to see how margins are going to improve in any of their businesses given the secular headwinds that are going on."
Chanos, who has been short H-P for more than a year - his bet did well in 2012, but hasn't done so in 2013 - declares the company's PC, printing, and enterprise ops to all be "under assault." "Turning around tech companies - IBM in the early '90s notwithstanding - is a very difficult undertaking."
Likewise, Chanos remains long Apple (AAPL +0.8%) and Samsung (SSNLF.PK, SSNGY.OB), viewing them as mobile offsets for his PC shorts. "[Samsung] is outright, outright very, very cheap ...  unlike a lot of guys like Hewlett and others who go out and acquire their R&D ... Samsung actually does it homegrown. As does Apple basically."
Chanos also discloses he's now long cloud HR/ERP software vendor Workday (WDAY +3.9%), using it as a hedge for an unnamed cloud software short he calls "an accounting nightmare."

While the number isn't pretty, it's notably better than the 11.4% drop IDC estimated for Q2, as well as the firm's respective Q3 and full-year forecasts of -9.5% and -9.7%. Easier comps helped out a bit (shipments fell 8.6% Y/Y a year ago), as did "channel intake of Windows 8.1-based systems" in September. (PR)
As was the case in Q2, U.S. and enterprise were areas of strength. U.S. shipments only fell 0.2%, and enterprise volumes saw a "slight uptick." But tablet cannibalization led Asia-Pac (exc. Japan) shipments to fall 8.8%. EMEA declined in-line with expectations, while Japan outperformed.
The mix shift is a positive for H-P (HPQ - 27% U.S. share vs. 17.1% global share), Intel (INTC - higher ASPs), and Microsoft (MSFT - higher ASPs and less piracy). It hurts Lenovo (LNVGY.PK), but the Chinese firm was still the market's top vendor, and saw its global share rise 160 bps Y/Y to 17.3%.
H-P was #2; its share rose 130 bps. #3 Dell, which has gotten more aggressive with its pricing, saw its share rise 90 bps to 11.7%.
Apple's (AAPL) U.S. PC share, which has been rising in recent years, fell 140 bps to 11.6%; the enterprise mix shift and pending MacBook Pro/Mac OS X refreshes likely played roles.
Other affected industry names: AMD, NVDA, MU, STX, WDC.

The White House has refused to grant Samsung (SSNLF.PK, SSNGY.OB) a veto on an ITC import ban on older smartphones deemed to be infringing Apple (AAPL -0.5%) patents related to swiping/scrolling gestures and headset detection. The decision comes two months after a ban on older iPhones/iPads ruled to be infringing a Samsung 3G patent was vetoed.
While critics might allege the differing rulings smack of hometown favoritism, the White House is likely to argue its stance is the due to the fact the Apple patents weren't standards-essential, and the Samsung patent was. The use of standards-essential IP in patent suits has turned into a hot-button political issue.
Regardless, the ban doesn't cover Samsung's latest phones, such as the Galaxy S4, S4 Mini, and Note 3, and is unlikely to have a big impact on the electronics giant's U.S. sales.

Though Peter Misek's upgrade got the most attention, Apple (AAPL +0.9%) received several other bullish sell-side notes today as well, helping shares outperform the Nasdaq by ~2%.
Cowen's Tim Arcuri, who made an Asian trip of his own, thinks Street iPhone estimates are conservative in spite of supply constraints. Arcuri sees 36M and 56M Sep. quarter and Dec. quarter shipments, respectively.
Meanwhile, Brian White says his Apple Barometer (monitors the sales of Apple-dependent Taiwanese suppliers) saw a 9%-10% M/M increase for September. That's better than 2012's 3%, though a little below an 8-year average of 11%.
More on Misek's upgrade: The Jefferies analyst sees the iPhone 6 having a 4.8" display, and expects the device will help Apple take back share from Android. He also thinks Apple's suppliers "have become far more lenient on price."
While analysts are increasingly upbeat, Julian Robertson isn't. The Tiger Management founder, whose firm liquidated its Apple position in Q1, says Steve Jobs' character makes him pessimistic about Apple's future  (video).
Robertson: "How can you create a great organization of people and be that mean of a person? ... [Jobs was] one of the great geniuses of the world, but ... bad culture, bad principles."

Canaccord's Mike Walkley says his Sep. iPhone (AAPL) survey data points to very strong early 5S/5C sales in both the U.S. and international markets; a large base of upgrade-eligible 4S users is likely helping. Likewise, Evercore's Rob Chira is raising his FQ4 (Dec. quarter) iPhone sales forecast to 56M from 54M, citing good momentum.
BMO's Keith Bachman offers a more guarded take. A U.S./U.K./German survey turned up muted enthusiasm for the latest iPhones, and found respondents assigning only "modest value" to relying on the same brand across multiple device types. Also, Bachman thinks (like Ming-Chi Kuo and Peter Misek) 5C inventory-building had much to do with Apple's 9M launch weekend iPhone sales.
Bachmann is lowering his Apple revenue and unit sales estimates, but is also raising his EPS and margin forecasts due to a higher-than-expected price for the 5C. His PT has been raised to $508 from $480.

comScore joins Kantar in reporting the iPhone picked up some more U.S. share ahead of the 5S/5C launches. The firm estimates 40.7% of U.S. smartphone users relied on an iPhone in the June-August timeframe, up from 40.4% for May-July and 39.2% from March-May. Android's June-August share stood at 51.6%, down from 52.4% for March-May.

 In spite of limited early 5S supplies due to fingerprint sensor issues, Gene Munster says checks at 60 Apple Stores (AAPL -0.1%) indicate at least one grey model was available at nearly every store. That's better than the situation a year ago, when the iPhone 5 was almost impossible to find. A spreadsheet from BTIG's Walter Piecyk provides mixed data on 5S availability. While AT&T and Verizon are indicating long shipment times for gold models, AT&T has 32GB and 64GB grey/silver models available, and 7-14-day shipping times for the 16GB versions. Verizon's times for grey/silver models range from 11-32 days, and Apple's online store only promises to ship ordered iPhones somewhere in October.
Wal-mart, no stranger to iPhone discounts, has begun selling the 16GB 5C for a subsidized $45 (it normally goes for $99).

 Multiple sites have reported Apple (AAPL) has acquired Cue, developer of a Google Now-like (GOOG) iOS personal assistant app. TechCrunch reports the purchase price was likely in the $50M-$60M range.
Cue, which recently announced it's shutting down its app, relied on a user's e-mails and social networking info to push time/location-sensitive notifications. Google Now does something similar while relying on Gmail, search, Maps, and other Google services.
Google is fresh off updating its iOS search app to send Android-like push notifications. Apple, meanwhile, has updated its iOS Notification Center (via iOS 7) to provide time-sensitive updates (among other things).
TechCrunch's Matthew Panzarino calls the deal a necessity in light of Google's Now's competitive edge. "Google Now offers a really compelling experience that only Google is churning through enough data to replicate ... There’s just nothing on iOS that compares." He thinks Cue "could be used to make Siri more powerful and aware, notifying you either via push notification or voice."
The Verge's Dan Seifert: "If this Cue purchase is really Apple’s move to take on Google Now, it has a LONG way to go. Google shouldn’t worry, Cue was pretty terrible." |Oct. 2, 2013, 9:44 AM|Retina iPad Mini reportedly delayed, Apple hires cable exec



Reuters reports the retina iPad Mini (AAPL -0.5%) "could be available in only limited quantities this year, if at all," thanks to display manufacturing challenges.
Sources say Apple's supply chain is just beginning to gear up to make displays for the tablet, and that Apple delayed certifying display manufacturers; LG Display (LPL), Samsung Display, and Sharp (SHCAY.PK) reportedly competed to supply panels.

Bloomberg previously reported a retina Mini and 5th-gen iPad would arrive this year, and the WSJ reported "mass production"  of a retina Mini would start in Q4. Reuters' report comes as Amazon rolls out new Kindle Fires with high-res displays, and a couple months after Google rolled out a second-gen Nexus 7 with a high-res display to good reviews.
Separately, Apple has hired Jean-Francois Mule, once an SVP for cable TV R&D consortium CableLabs, to be an engineering director. That's boosting speculation the company is working on set-tops that provide direct access to pay-TV content.

The Verge's Vlad Savov gives Samsung's (SSNLF.PK, SSNGY.OB) $299 Galaxy Gear smartwatch a score of just 4.0/10. He likes the device's display, voice calling abilities, and camera, but not much else. The Gear is deemed too dependent on paired smartphones, and its battery life (one day under normal use) too short. In addition, its notifications are called "uninformative;" and its apps "buggy or substandard."
Savov: "A smartwatch the Galaxy Gear is not. Frankly, I’m not sure exactly what it’s supposed to be."
Engadget's Brad Molen is a little more positive. He calls the Gear comfortable to wear and its performance adequate, but is just as critical of its notifications, and doesn't like the lack of touchless controls. "The Galaxy Gear is a solid effort from Samsung, but it needs time to grow and develop." AnandTech's Brian Klug reaches a similar conclusion.
Meanwhile, a Korean site reports Apple's (AAPL +2.2%) much-rumored iWatch will feature a flexible OLED display, and that Apple is working on 1.3", 1.4", and 1.5" prototypes. The 1.5" prototype has reportedly "already been made." The Gear has a rigid 1.6" OLED display.

Ahead of the iPhone 5S/5C (AAPL -0.7%) launches, the iPhone managed to take share (on a Y/Y basis) in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, according to Kantar Woldpanel's latest data.
Kantar estimates the iPhone had a 39.3% share of U.S. smartphone sales in the June-August timeframe, +540 bps Y/Y. In the EU5, where the iPhone has been losing ground to Android, its share rose 200 bps to 16.1%, and in Japan, it rose to 48.6% prior to the start of NTT DoCoMo's 5S/5C sales. The U.K. (27.5%) is Apple's strongest major European market.
Android (GOOG +0.2%) respectively had U.S., EU5, and Japanese shares of 55.1% (-560 bps), 70.1% (+130 bps), and 46.7%. It's still taking share from the iPhone in China ahead of an expected China Mobile iPhone deal. Android's Chinese share rose 920 bps to 72.4%, while the iPhone's fell 270 bps to 20.8%.
Europe is turning out to be a bright spot for Windows Phone (previous): Kantar estimates Microsoft's (MSFT -1.2%) OS had a 9.2% share in the EU5, +420 bps Y/Y. Nokia's Lumia 925 and 1020 launches, along with strong demand for the low-end 520, likely helped. But WP only had a 3% share in the U.S., and a 2.1% share in China.

A Chinese-language site (translation) has leaked an image for a China Mobile (CHL +0.5%) poster advertising the iPhone 5S and 5C (AAPL +0.6%). The posters make note of the 5S/5C's support for CHL's TD-LTE 4G network.
One source tells the site sales could start in November, following testing in September/October.

The WSJ reported on Sep. 6 Apple is getting ready to ship iPhones to China Mobile, and Chinese regulators recently gave the iPhone a green light to run on CHL's network (unofficially, many of the carrier's subs already use iPhones, courtesy of grey-market purchases).

IDC estimates the iPhone only had a 5% share of the Chinese smartphone market in Q2, thanks in part to its premium pricing in a market where per capita GDP (in absolute dollars) is a little above $6K.

 KGI's well-connected Ming-Chi Kuo estimates 3.5M-4.5M of Apple's (AAPL) 9M iPhone sales last weekend were the high-end 5S, leaving the cheaper 5C with 4.5M-5.5M. Kuo's figures are quite a bit different from those of Localytics, which earlier estimated the 5S outsold the 5C by more than a 3:1 margin. Localytics data is based on activations, says Kuo, while his are rooted in production. Kuo says 5S supplies - constrained at launch - are improving, and he expects that model to be the 'main contributor" to total iPhone sales in the holiday quarter.

France's finance ministry is reportedly investigating Apple (AAPL -1.2%) for the iPhone deal terms it sets for carriers. Apple's purchase requirements (something U.S. carriers are all too familiar with), ad restrictions, and sales commission terms are said to be under scrutiny.
In March, the EU said it was investigating informal carrier complaints about Apple's deal terms.

The Oregonian reports Apple is plotting a 96-acre expansion to a giant Oregon data center it built last year. Apple has already filed plans for a new local data center on existing property.
Apple has also built, or plans to build, data centers in North Carolina, Nevada, and Hong Kong, as it works to keep up with surging App Store/iCloud traffic. Last year, the company set an FY13 capex budget of $10B.
Taiwan's United Daily News reports Apple is working on a 12" iPad that will be made by contract manufacturer Quanta. While Taiwanese product launch rumors tend to be hit-and-miss, there have been multiple reports of a larger iPad being under consideration.

A year after Apple (AAPL +0.2%) launched new iMacs featuring an overhauled, ultra-thin design to much fanfare, the company has more quietly refreshed the internals of its all-in-one desktops.
Apple's new 21.5" and 27" iMacs contain quad-core Intel Haswell CPUs (Core i5 and i7, 2.7GHz.-3.4GHz.), and 3 of the 4 feature Nvidia (NVDA -0.2%) GeForce 700 series GPUs (Apple promises a ~40% GPU performance gain). 802.11ac Wi-Fi radios and improved flash memory and Fusion Drive performance are also part of the package.
The new iMacs are priced from $1,299-$1,999. Apple's Mac revenue fell 1% Y/Y in the June quarter to $4.9B (better than the PC industry's performance). Units fell 7% to to 3.75M.
Meanwhile, after tearing the devices down, IHS estimates a 16GB iPhone 5S (unsubsidized price of $649) has a manufacturing cost of $199, and a 16GB 5C ($549 unsubsidized) a cost of $173.
The research firm points out Apple puts more effort into RF chip integration than rivals. "Where other phone companies would be using whatever chips its various vendors sell off-the-shelf, Apple seems to be pushing its RF suppliers to do things they don’t do for anyone else."
IHS thinks it only costs Apple $10 more to make a 32GB 5S than a 16GB 5S, and $19 more to make a 64GB 5S. Thus, the $100 and $200 markups for the 32GB and 64GB models are respectively estimated to carry incremental margins of 90% and 90.5%.

 "When the facts change, we change our minds," says Susquehanna's Chris Caso, upping Apple (AAPL) to Buy with $625 price target (from $440 previous). He speaks of the 9M in weekend sales for the new iPhones - "more successful than we and many others had expected." Importantly, he notes, Apple didn't need to sacrifice margins, current shortages mean a healthy backlog entering CQ4, and a China Mobile launch may be about to come. The risk here is demand slows after the initial launch, but it's a risk he's willing to take, and Caso's a buyer on weakness ahead of next year's iPhone 6 cycle.

As is usually the case just prior to a new product launch, Apple's (AAPL) market share in China slipped in Q2 to 5%, but IDC sees the company's performance improving "remarkably with the launch of the new iPhone."

SocGen's Andy Perkins isn't impressed Apple's (AAPL +3.5%) new FQ4 revenue guidance remains within its original range in spite of the company's strong weekend iPhone sales. He takes this as a sign higher 5S/5C sales "came at the expense of the 4S." His $500 PT remains unchanged.
Others on the sell-side are more enthusiastic, taking the numbers as evidence 5C demand was better than feared. Gene Munster thinks the 5C may have accounted for 3M-4M of the 9M+ weekend sales.
Mobile analytics firm Localytics offers a different take. The firm's tracking data indicates the 5S outsold the 5C by a 3.4:1 margin in the U.S. over the weekend, and by a 3.7:1 margin internationally. In Japan, where NTT DoCoMo has commenced iPhone sales and the 5S is being offered for free with 2-year contracts, the ratio was 5:1.
The 5S/5C managed to account for 1.36% of all active U.S. iPhones tracked by Localytics as of 8PM ET yesterday. 49% of them were on AT&T's (T -0.7%) network, and 38% on Verizon's (VZ).

 It's a blowout number for Apple (AAPL) which reports selling 9M combined of the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C in the first three days following their launch. This compares to about 5M expected by some analysts after popping in on the malls over the weekend, and the 7.75M at the top end of forecasts. Shares +3.6% premarket. |Sep. 23, 2013, 7:57 AM|Weekend action sobers up analysts' view of iPhone sales

 Weekend sales of the iPhone were probably close to the bottom of the 5M-6M range he expected, says Piper's Gene Munster. About 95% of those waiting in line were there for the 5S, says Munster, with about 90% upgrading from an older version (83% were upgrading when the 5 was launched, 73% for the 4). At least one analyst had expected weekend sales of 7.75M, according to Bloomberg. BMO's Keith Bachman hit the malls to find longer lines than last year's iPhone 5 launch, but writes this off as having to do with no pre-orders for the 5S. 5C sales look like a disappointment even to his already-muted expectations for that unit. The gold 5S is a hit, but little supply exists, with one visited store running out in the first 30 minutes.

 That didn't take long - a group of German hackers from the respected Chaos Computer Club yesterday said they have cracked the fingerprint scanner of the iPhone 5S, just two days after the Apple (AAPL) device went on sale. The company was hoping that the scanner, and the added security it was supposed to bring, would differentiate the new smartphone. "Fingerprints should not be used to secure anything," said one hacker. "You leave them everywhere, and it is far too easy to make fake fingers out of lifted prints." |Sep. 20, 2013, 3:02 PM|Apple roundup: 5S/5C mix, Apple TV software, A7 production



Media reports suggest most of the iPhone (AAPL -0.2%) users who rushed to upgrade this morning opted for the 5S rather than the 5C. CNNMoney's Philip Elmer-Dewitt, who was at the flagship NYC Apple Store: "Everybody I asked was there to buy the iPhone 5S."
Dewitt qualifies his remarks by noting anyone looking to buy the 5C could have pre-ordered online (unlike the 5S). U.S. and U.K. carrier sources have reported 5C pre-orders have underwhelmed.
Meanwhile, as expected, Apple has rolled out an Apple TV software update. The refresh adds iTunes Radio support, as well as a feature called AirPlay from iCloud, which allows content to be streamed via iTunes. Google's new Chromecast HDMI stick enables streaming via the Chrome browser.
A new Apple TV set-top is reportedly due later this year.
A Chipworks analysis indicates the 5S' A7 CPU is made by Samsung rather than TSMC (TSM -1.4%). There had been reports Apple would tap TSMC to make the A7. However, the WSJ has reported TSMC would only start mass-production of Apple CPUs in 2014, while leveraging its next-gen 20nm process.
Chipworks also reports NXP (NXPI +1.6%) is manufacturing the 5S' M7 motion co-processor. Apple promises the M7 will improve battery life (by offloading tasks from the A7) and (by constantly recording movements) will enable new health, fitness, gaming, and mapping apps/services.

After rising 6.6% yesterday to new highs, Pandora (P -3%) is giving back some of its gains today.
This morning, the Web/mobile radio leader announced underwriters have fully exercised the 2.73M-share overallotment option provided with the company's 18.2M-share stock offering (priced yesterday). That means the offering now stands to yield gross proceeds of $393M, and increase Pandora's diluted share count by 9%.

Initial takes on iTunes Radio (AAPL - became available on Wednesday, as part of iOS 7) have mostly been positive. Users like the service's music algorithms, History and Wish List features, and station-customizing tools, as well as a Featured Stations option that CNET (4.5/5 stars) thinks "[blends] the personal touch of a curated list with the scale and smarts of an underlying algorithm."
CNET also praises the larger size of iTunes Radio's library (27M tracks to Pandora's 1M), ability to leverage iTunes playback/purchase data, and "minimally intrusive ads." Billboard (2.5/4), however, is critical of iTunes Radio's Siri integration (unable to handle some basic commands) and the reliability of its syncing features.
Still working in Pandora's favor: the time invested by its 72M+ active users in creating custom stations, and the ability to support users looking to listen on both iOS and Android hardware.

After tumbling from Sep. 11-16 following its iPhone launch event and general 5C pricing disappointment, Apple (AAPL +0.8%) has since recovered about half its losses.
In spite of widespread reports of limited 5S supplies, there have been plenty of huge lines at Apple Stores. The 37M iPhones Apple sold in calendar Q4 2011 stands to create a large base of users with expired contracts.
Apple's U.S. online store indicates a 7-10 business day shipping wait time for space grey and silver 5S models. Gold models won't ship until some point in October. International online stores are providing similar wait times.

The WSJ reports Apple has asked suppliers to boost gold 5S production by 1/3 due to stronger-than-expected demand. Hong Kong carriers who do brisk business selling phones to mainland Chinese early adopters have seen especially strong interest.

The launch comes amid reports that pre-orders for the 5C have been rather underwhelming in the U.S. and U.K., and speculation that 5S supplies will be limited in the U.S. Analysts expect Apple to sell at least 5M iPhones this weekend, the same as the debut for the iPhone 5.

The site also reports "a few white/silver and even fewer gold iPhone 5s deliveries are trickling in the warehouses but hardly enough for wide dispersal by retail stores."
There have already been multiple reports this week of limited launch-day 5S inventories in the U.S.
Meanwhile, analytics firm Mixpanel reports 39% of the iOS devices accessing its network are now on iOS 7. Chitika says iOS 7 grew to make up 18.2% of its monitored iOS Web traffic within 24 hours, which compares with 14.8% for iOS 6 in its first 24 hours. (more details)

"We never had an objective to sell a low-cost phone," says Tim Cook (AAPL +1.8%) in a BloombergBusinessweek cover story, defending the iPhone 5C's pricing amid criticism it's too expensive to challenge cheaper Android phones that have helped give Google's OS a 79% smartphone share (per IDC).
Adds Cook: "There’s always a large junk part of the market ... We’re not in the junk business." Some might disagree all of the latest mid-range Android phones fit that description. Meanwhile, Jony Ive takes a not-so-subtle jab at Samsung's product strategy. "We didn’t start opportunistically with 10 bits of technology that we could try to find a use for to add to our features list."

Gene Munster forecasts 5M-6M iPhones will be sold this weekend, after the 5S/5C go on sale on Friday. That's only a little above last year's 5M first-weekend iPhone 5 sales, something Munster attributes to supply constraints. BTIG is more optimistic, predicting at least 6M weekend sales.
iOS 7 was installed on 29% of all iOS devices within 16 hours of yesterday's release. The download activity was strong enough to make total Internet traffic spike in parts of the U.S. and Europe; that's an incremental positive for Apple CDN partner Akamai (AKAM +0.4%).
The Verge's David Pierce has given iOS 7 a score of 8/10. He's a fan of the OS' Control Center and improved notifications, but calls its design "disjointed and confusing in places," and its icons "horrible."

Developers have been busy making their apps iOS 7-friendly. Apple blogger/fan Pixel Envy has provided a very comprehensive review of the OS.
A U.S. carrier source tells Reuters iPhone 5C pre-orders haven't been "overwhelming," and that supply for both the 5S and 5C has disappointed. Multiple reports emerged yesterday of tight 5S inventories.
Hit-and-miss Digitimes reports the 5th-gen iPad and retina iPad Mini will join the iPhone 5S in having sapphire home buttons (presumably with fingerprint sensors underneath), and that iPhone 6 will "possibly" feature sapphire touchscreen cover glass.
Sapphire is thinner and more scratch-resistant than current cover glass solutions such as Gorilla Glass, but is also much more expensive.

Reviewers find much to like about the iPhone 5S (AAPL +1.5%) and 5C's hardware, and generally give a thumbs-up to iOS 7 along the way.
The NYT's David Pogue praises the performance of the 5S' A7 CPU (scored well in AnandTech benchmarks), the improved color balance yielded by its dual-LED flash, and the convenience of its fingerprint sensor. "The best part is that [the sensor] actually works — every single time, in my tests."

Pogue also praises iOS 7's revamped UI and plethora of new features (e.g. new apps, improved multitasking, iTunes Radio), while granting not everyone will love the former. "I think you should install it. The structure, layout and features represent some of Apple’s best work. The look of iOS 7 — well, that judgment is up to you."

Walt Mossberg: "If you are an iPhone fan with any model older than the iPhone 5, the new 5s will be a big step up ... There are too many new features in iOS 7 to list here, but it’s a big improvement."
In his 5S review, Engadget's Myriam Joire states Apple "took a good product and made it better through hardware upgrades, new features and a completely revamped [OS]." But he adds "a 4-inch display likely won't cut it" for "anyone who needs copious amounts of screen space."

Joire on the 5C: "We're happy with the iPhone 5C in terms of performance and battery life, but we're longing for a better camera and a larger screen ...  We think most buyers will pick the iPhone 5C for the price and color choices alone, while the iPhone 5S will appeal to power users and gamers."
The iPhone 5 debuted to very good reviews a year ago. However, only a handful of those reviews criticized Apple Maps, which ignited a firestorm after it was released.

"We will have grotesquely unavailable inventory," says one source. Another also expects relatively low shipments, while adding demand could be less than expected thanks to interest in the 5C.
Likewise, U.S. Apple Store sources tell 9to5 Mac the 5C will account for "about 70-80% of new iPhones" available on Friday.
Meanwhile, Apple's Chinese online store, which began taking 5S reservations today, quickly sold out most of its 5S stock. The sell-outs have been taken as a sign of low supply. Apple won't begin taking 5S pre-orders elsewhere until Friday.

Jefferies and others have reported fingerprint sensor production issues are limiting 5S supply.
Apple remains higher, but has pared its Tuesday gains, which follow a Monday drop that came in the wake of disappointing China Unicom 5S/5C reservation data. iOS 7 launches tomorrow.

He won't name names (HPQ is already trodden ground), but Cory Johnson's mentioning of IBM and 3D Systems (DDD) as fitting the bill has Chanos nodding his head, "Acquisitions are a way of capitalizing R&D."

Meanwhile, China Telecom (CHA +2.5%) has cut its iPhone subsidies. A subscriber signing up for an RMB289/month ($47/month) plan will get an iPhone 5S subsidy of RMB2890, 15% less than the RMB3400 subsidy it provided for the iPhone 5. It's worth noting CHA's ARPU is below $10.
The Chinese figures come amidst sharp criticism of the 5C's unsubsidized pricing, which starts at $735 in China. For reference, upstart Xiaomi's new Mi3 flagship Android phone (5" 1080p display, 13MP camera) starts at $327 in the Middle Kingdom.
On the other hand, Japanese carriers are aggressively subsidizing the 5S in the wake of NTT DoCoMo's (DCM +0.7%) iPhone deal. DoCoMo, SoftBank (SFTBF.PK), and KDDI are each providing the 5S for free with 2-year contracts for certain plans.
Kantar Japan recently estimated 2/3 of DoCoMo subs who have been leaving the carrier ended up buying an iPhone.

Apple (AAPL -1.6%) closed lower following Peter Misek's downbeat note and concerns about the fact delivery times for the iPhone 5C remain unchanged (pre-orders started today). Shares are down 8% from where they traded going into Tuesday's iPhone event.
Two of Apple's staunchest sell-side defenders, Brian White and Gene Munster, sprung into action again today. Echoing Misek's comments about 5S fingerprint sensor production issues - Digitimes and KGI reported about this in August - White admitted the "complexity" of the 5S is hampering production. But he added the unchanged 5C delivery times are simply due to healthy supply (the result of a "relatively straightforward" manufacturing process).
Munster's analysis of "U.S. consumer sentiment" for Apple's latest iPhones, as measured by Twitter commentary, indicates 69% and 67% of comments were respectively positive for the 5S and 5C two days after the launch event. That compares with 67% for the iPhone 5 last year. Of course, a major gap has opened up between the iPhone's market share in the U.S. and many other big markets.
Also: U.K. retailer Phones 4u says it has "seen double digit growth in [5S/5C] pre-registrations compared to the same period for iPhone 5 last year." Upgrades from the iPhone users responsible for the blowout iPhone 4S sales seen in late 2011 stand to bolster this fall's sales.

He lowers his FY14 EPS estimate to $37.95 from $38.78 previously, and against consensus $42.66. He's upping his FQ313 EPS forecast to $8.14 from $7.58 previously, and against consensus $7.65. Turning to the 5C, Misek has his doubts: "Paying a high premium for a product over a year old, made of plastic, has a 4" screen, and often linked to a content store that is not superior to alternatives, especially in China." He maintains his Hold rating while lowering the price target to $425 from $450.

"We think the biggest surprise from an investment perspective is that the new iPhone 5C will be positioned as a midrange phone, and won’t provide much near-term help in addressing lower price points in emerging markets." His team doesn't expect the addition of DoCOMo and China Mobile to allow for the sort of significant market boost that would come from a true lower-priced phone. He's more bullish next year given expectations for a larger screen iPhone and more aggressive pricing for the 5C.

 A long-awaited deal between Apple (AAPL) and China Mobile (CHL) appears to have moved closer after the U.S. company received a license for its phones to operate on China Mobile's 3G and 4G networks from the country's Telecom Equipment Certification Center. Apple's products also obtained licenses to run on the infrastructure of China Unicom (CHU) and China Telecom (CHA), both of which will sell the two iPhones that were unveiled yesterday. While a deal with China Mobile will open up a market of 700M subscribers, the "low-end" iPhone 5C looks rather pricey for the cost-conscious consumers that Apple was expected to target with the handset. The device will retail at 4,488 yuan ($730), just 800 yuan ($130) less than the top-of-the-line 5S. |Sep. 10, 2013, 5:38 PM|Apple closes lower following iPhone event; 5C to start at $735 in China


Though initial takes on the iPhone 5S/5C are generally positive, Apple's (AAPL -2.3%) event didn't feature many big announcements that hadn't been reported by the rumor mill (the A7's use of a 64-bit architecture is one notable exception).
Meanwhile, TechInAsia observes Apple's Chinese site will be selling the 16GB iPhone 5C for an unsubsidized RMB4488 ($735), or just $131 less than the 16GB 5S. In the U.S., the 5C starts at $549 unsubsidized. It doesn't look as if Apple is willing to greatly sacrifice its margins to take share from cheaper Android hardware.
Though being discontinued elsewhere, the iPhone 4 is still available in China for RMB2,588 ($420) for the time being.
For now, Apple isn't giving 3rd-party developers access to its fingerprint sensor API. Odds are that will change down the line.

AnandTech offers a favorable take on the sensor after trying it out "Tapping and holding your finger on the button quickly unlocks the device."

Engadget on the 5C: "This is the spiritual successor to the iPhone 5 ... Given the price, it may not turn out to be the device for emerging markets, but it at least gives interested iPhone buyers more choice."

The Verge on the 5S: "This is definitely a refining year for Apple, but all of the refinements on the iPhone 5S are solid. That fingerprint reader might end up being a bigger deal than you'd think."

Update: Though Apple's iPhone LTE page doesn't mention support for China Mobile's TD-LTE network (as noted by Fierce Wireless), technical specs for the 5S and 5C indicate a variant of each phone will support the LTE bands (38-40) used by China Mobile.

As expected, the iPhone 5S' (AAPL -0.9%) camera has dual LEDs (should improve color accuracy) and a larger (F2.2) aperture, the latter should help with low-light shots. It also has a bigger image sensor, though its resolution is unchanged at 8MP (Phil Schiller: "Bigger pixels make a better picture."). (live blog)
Other new camera features: auto image stabilization, a 10fps burst mode, and a 120fps Slo-Mo video recording option. The camera improvement come as Nokia and Sony tout the high-end imaging capabilities of smartphones such as the Lumia 1020 and Xperia Z1.
Also, the oft-rumored fingerprint sensor has been revealed. Called Touch ID, the sensor is embedded within a sapphire crystal home button (incremental positive for GTAT), and can be used to unlock the 5S, make iTunes purchases, and carry out other tasks within apps.
Like the iPhone 5 (until now), 16-64GB 5S models will sell for a subsidized $199-$399. The iPhone 5 is being discontinued to make room for the 5C; the 4S will now be free with a contract.
5S/5C pre-orders start on Sep. 13. Sales begin in the U.S., Japan, China, and 6 other markets on Sep. 20. NTT DoCoMo (DCM +1.5%) will be among the Japanese carriers to sell the phones. 100 countries/270 carriers will be supported by December.
5S/5C sales should benefit from Apple's strong customer loyalty and the huge 4S sales recorded two years ago (many of those buyers are about to see their contracts expire). But will they be able to reel in many of the Android users who have come to love larger screens?

Apple's (AAPL -0.6%) latest flagship phone is made of aluminum (like the iPhone 5), and comes in 3 colors (silver, gold, and "space gray"). Its dual-core A7 CPU uses a 64-bit architecture (prior A-series CPUs are 32-bit), which opens the door to more built-in RAM and better performance for certain applications. (live blog)
Apple declares the iPhone 5S, aided by both the A7 and iOS 7, will be up to 2x as fast than the iPhone 5. Graphics performance gains are larger in some instances (noteworthy in light of iOS 7's game controller support).
The A7 is accompanied by an M7 "motion co-processor" that "continuously measures motion data," and which Apple promises will enable new health/fitness apps. That could be a positive for InvenSense (INVN +1%).
Apple promises 10 hours of 3G talk time, 4G browsing time, and video playback time for the 5S. Standby is pegged at 250 hours.

|Sep. 10, 2013, 12:16 PM|Apple roundup: 5S fingerprint sensor confirmed, big marketing push on tap?


Ahead of today's 1PM ET iPhone event (live blog), the WSJ has confirmed the iPhone 5S will include a fingerprint sensor. However, the cheaper 5C isn't expected to have one.

AdAge reports Apple (AAPL -0.8%) is "significantly expanding" its internal ad design/marketing team. One exec thinks its ranks could grow to 500-600 from a current 300. In June, Apple released a high-profile TV ad that was likened to a manifesto.
Analysts have been tripping over themselves to predict the impact of the 5C and the reportedly pending China Mobile and NTT DoCoMo deals. FBN (Outperform) thinks adding China Mobile could boost calendar 2014 EPS by $2, assuming a relatively low ASP ($425) and gross margin (30%). The firm observes Apple was estimated by Strategy Analytics to have only a 4.3% share of the Chinese smartphone market in Q2.
Deutsche's Brian Whitmore is more bullish, estimating China Mobile and DoCoMo could drive 35M extra iPhone sales in 2014, and lift EPS by $5. He observes ~35M China Mobile subs already use "gray market" iPhones, and thinks most will upgrade if given a chance to buy subsidized hardware.
Citi's Glen Yeung remains cautious, arguing the 5C's ability to take share could be limited by the fact $400+ phones only accounted for 13.7% of the Q2 smartphone market (per Gartner), and estimating every "5% move in mix" from the 5S to the 5C will affect gross margin by 315 bps and EPS by 2.1%.
|Sep. 10, 2013, 2:56 AM|Apple set to unveil two new iPhones

 Apple (AAPL) is due to hold a press event in California today, when it is expected to unveil a new high-end iPhone that could contain a fingerprint scanner and longer battery life, and a lower-cost version of the handset. Apple could also release a revamp of its iOS software that will include iTunes radio. However, Apple won't announce a deal with China Mobile (CHL), the world's largest cellular carrier, Bloomberg reports. While the cheaper iPhone could increase share in emerging markets, Benedict Evans, an analyst at Enders Analysis, says it may not be a major profit driver. There's also the danger that it could damage Apple's reputation as a premium brand. In India, where Apple's volumes are low, the company has not followed Samsung's lead in increasing prices despite the plunge in the rupee this year. The "strategy could pay off if stable prices lure new buyers," says IDC's Kiranjeet Kaur, although others aren't so convinced. |Sep. 9, 2013, 9:28 PM|TD Ameritrade index shows clients buying August's dip

With PC's now in "protect" mode, the "attack" part of Lenovo (LNVGY.PK) CEO Yang Yuanqing's "Protect and Attack" strategy has shifted to tablets and smartphones. Yang has reorganized the company to address "attack markets" head-on, and believes even gorillas Apple (AAPL) and Samsung (SSNLF.PK, SSNGY.OB) aren't invincible.
"We know the playbook; we've done it on PCs," says Gerry Smith who has seen it up close as a former Dell exec, and now heads Lenovo's Americas group. "We can attack on scale. We'll attack on cost efficiency and speed. We can attack these guys from the bottom, and put a lot of pressure on them from a product portfolio, pricing, time-to-market perspective."
Lenovo produced 11.4M smartphones and 1.5M tablets in FQ1, a triple and a quadruple, respectively, from a year earlier. The company this week launched a new flagship premium phone, the Vibe X, and plans a number of other new products before year's end.
"What P/E would investors pay for a 'Chinese Apple,'" asks bullish portfolio manager James Weir. He notes the company continues to gain market share in flat PC markets, but the potential for "rerating" is in mobile. "If Lenovo can keep growing this, they can earn the right to be rated with Apple and Samsung as a sexy consumer electronics player, not just a PC box seller."

SA Pro's Stephen Simpson is of a similar mind about Lenovo's opportunity in mobile.

The paper adds Apple (AAPL +0.8%) has asked Foxconn to add China Mobile (CHL +1%) to the list of carriers receiving the iPhone 5C. A deal between Apple and the world's largest carrier has been increasingly expected following recent talks, comments, and event announcements.It isn't clear from the report whether Apple will also be shipping CHL the iPhone 5S or 5.Multiple reports emerged yesterday that Apple is also set to begin selling the iPhone to NTT DoCoMo, Meanwhile, Bloomberg observed China Mobile is believed to be driving a hard bargain with Apple. DoCoMo (60M+ high-ARPU subs) and CHL (740M+ subs, but a much lower ARPU) have easily been the largest/most lucrative carriers not to carry the iPhone.There have also been reports over the last two days that China Unicom and Telecom will begin selling the iPhone later this month. But China Mobile sales could take longer to start, due to the need for regulators to vet an iPhone supporting the carrier's TD-LTE 4G network.|Sep. 6, 2013, 10:58 AM|Apple roundup: e-book injunction, Chinese 5S/5C sales starting in Sep.


Two months after U.S. district judge Denise Cote declared Apple (AAPL +0.2%) guilty of conspiring to fix e-book prices, and two weeks after the DOJ proposed e-book injunction terms, Cote has issued an injunction.
As suggested by the DOJ, Apple is prohibited from striking restrictive e-book pricing deals with publishers for 5 years, and is required to stagger its talks with publishers to prevent collusion. Also, an external monitor has been assigned for two years.
However, Apple won't be required to allow rivals to sell e-books through their iOS apps without giving Apple a 30% cut, as the DOJ had suggested. Amazon (AMZN +0.4%) has refused to sell e-books through its Kindle iOS apps out of an unwillingness to pay Apple 30% of its take.
Meanwhile, Reuters nearly backs up yesterday's Sina Tech report by reporting China Unicom (CHU -0.3%) and Telecom (CHA -0.6%) will begin selling the iPhone 5S/5C shortly after it goes on sale in the U.S., a major change of pace from the delays accompanying past Chinese iPhone launches.
Other news: Apple Insider reports Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) will be released at the end of October, and Quantcast and Piper estimate iOS' share of U.S. mobile browsing traffic has grown to 65%.
The latter is a negative for Google (GOOG +0.2%), due to the huge traffic acquisition payments it makes to Apple for Mobile Safari search ad clicks. However, Google doesn't have to pay Apple if iOS users rely on Chrome, as a growing portion of them are.

It's a busy day for the Apple (AAPL) rumor mill. The WSJ now reports the company "has begun evaluating a plan to offer iPhones with screens ranging from 4.8 inches to as high as six inches." Moreover, sources state Apple's "internal deliberations and plans indicate it appears more willing to move ahead than in years past."
The paper reported in July Apple had ordered display prototypes for 4"+ iPhones and a ~13" iPad, and Reuters reported in June Apple is thinking of selling 4.7" and 5.7" iPhones.
While Apple reportedly evaluates, phablet demand is soaring, particularly in Asia. IDC estimates phablet sales doubled Q/Q and rose 620% Y/Y in Asia-Pac (exc. Japan) in Q2, to 25.2M units (nearly even with regional notebook and tablet sales combined).
The popularity of large-screen phones, together with strong demand for low-end Android phones in emerging markets, has contributed to the iPhone's recent share losses in Europe and (outside of Japan) Asia.

Samsung unveiled the Galaxy Note 3 (5.7" 1080p display) yesterday.
The upcoming iPhone 5S and 5C are both expected to sport 4" displays.

If the Chinese media report (comes from local site Sina Tech - translation)  pans out, it means China Telecom (CHA +0.4%) and China Unicom (CHU -0.3%) will start selling Apple's (AAPL -0.8%) newest iPhones the same day they're expected to launch in the U.S. and several other big international markets.
Last year, Telecom and Unicom didn't begin selling the iPhone 5 until Dec. 14, more than 2 months after the device went on sale in dozens of other markets.
Sina Tech also reports China Mobile (CHL +0.7%) won't be able to sell the 5S until November (assuming a deal is announced), due to the need for regulatory approval of an iPhone supporting CHL's TD-LTE 4G network.
The 5S is said to come in 4 colors, and the plastic-shell 5C in 5 colors. Other reports suggest the 5S' colors will be white, black, gold, and graphite, and the 5C's colors white, red, green, blue, and yellow.
An iPhone event will take place in Beijing shortly after Apple's main Sep. 10 event.

Earlier: DoCoMo to reportedly offer iPhone soon
|Sep. 5, 2013, 2:25 PM|Nikkei: NTT DoCoMo to offer iPhone as soon as this fall


The Japanese paper says DoCoMo (DCM +1.1%) is likely to announce a partnership with Apple (AAPL -0.8%) on the day of its iPhone launch. Apple has announced an iPhone satellite event will take place in Tokyo (along with ones in Beijing and Berlin) hours after its main Sep. 10 event in Cupertino.
A DoCoMo EVP suggested last month a deal could be close. Previous talks between Apple and DoCoMo reportedly faltered due to Apple's purchase requirements and DoCoMo's insistence on pre-installing some of its apps.
DoCoMo, by far Japan's largest carrier (60M+ subs, 1/4 of which are now using 4G phones), has been losing share to SoftBank (SFTBF.PK) and KDDI in large part due to its failure to carry the iPhone. Though DoCoMo's sub base is much smaller than China Mobile's 740M, a much larger portion of it can afford a $450+ (unsubsidized) phone.
Japan is the iPhone's strongest major international market. Thanks largely to iPhone sales, Apple's Japanese revenue rose 27% Y/Y in FQ3 to $2.5B, even as revenue fell 14% in Greater China and 18% in the rest of Asia-Pac.

Update: Bloomberg reports Apple is "near a final agreement" with DoCoMo, and that the carrier "may begin offering the iPhone later this year."

Bloomberg observes China Mobile (CHL +0.1%) is widely believed to be driving a hard bargain in its iPhone talks with Apple (AAPL -0.3%).
Avondale's John Bright: "Apple’s unwillingness to provide meaningful concessions and China Mobile’s unwillingness to subsidize a high-cost device have inhibited a deal until now." HSBC's Tucker Grinnan thinks the world's biggest carrier wants a cut of App Store sales as part of any deal.
CHL's ability to post decent 3G sub growth in spite of lacking the iPhone has arguably given it more leverage. Bloomberg's column comes amidst speculation a Beijing iPhone satellite event could include a CHL announcement.
KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo now thinks a retina iPad Mini will launch by the end of 2013 (along with a 5th-gen regular iPad). That's in-line with an Aug. Bloomberg report.
Kuo also believes a new non-retina Mini will launch in early '14 to take on cheap Android tablets that have been rapidly gaining share (particularly in emerging markets), and that both the retina Mini and 5th-gen iPad will use a new A7X CPU (the 4th-gen iPad uses the A6X).

IHS thinks Apple may need to acquire a DRAM/NAND flash memory manufacturer, to secure supply, develop custom parts (something suppliers have been reluctant to do for Apple), and match Samsung's level of vertical integration.
The firm argues Micron (MU +2.8%) "could be a logical [M&A] candidate." But with a market cap of $15.7B, it definitely wouldn't come cheap. Apple bought NAND controller developer Anobit last year.

The Guardian reported last week that the NSA had "paid millions of dollars to cover the [PRISM compliance] costs of major internet companies." The tempest of public attention escalated yesterday, after The Washington Post reported that the U.S. government will pay $278M during the fiscal year to telecommunications firms for clandestine access to their networks.
At stake is consumer perception (and business) of what degree of privacy can be expected from the services provided by tech companies. Microsoft, Google, Apple (AAPL), Yahoo (YHOO), Facebook (FB), AOL, Twitter, and Reddit have all moved to distance themselves from the NSA scandal.

The site also reports Apple is testing a 64-bit version of its A7 CPU (believed to be inside the iPhone 5S). Current A-series CPUs are 32-bit. A 64-bit chip could deliver better performance for certain tasks, and would be needed if Apple decided to put more than 4GB of RAM inside an iDevice.
Fox News' Clayton Morris reports hearing the A7 is running 31% faster than the A6 (inside the iPhone 5) in tests, and that the 5S will have a separate motion-tracking chip. Earlier this year, Apple filed a patent application for an eye-tracking feature similar to Samsung's Smart Scroll.

 It may just all be about the timing at this point, according to NTT DoCoMo (DCM) senior EVP Kazuto Tsubouchi. "It would be difficult to start sales on the 10th," he tells Japan's Sankei Shimbun, referring to the date Apple (AAPL) is rumored to introduce the iPhone 5S, among other phones. "Docomo is ready but timing is the problem." It's not the first time a deal was believed to be near.

The DOJ is now proposing Apple (AAPL -0.5%) receive a 5-year injunction on striking restrictive e-book pricing deals with publishers; it previously wanted a 10-year injunction. Also, language that Apple argued would hurt its ability to effectively run the App Store (previous) has been removed from the DOJ's official proposal.
However, the DOJ now wants Apple's negotiations with publishers to be staggered, so as to prevent future collusion, and still wants an external monitor.
The proposals bear some resemblance to the ones recently suggested by U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, who in July declared Apple guilty of conspiring to fix e-book prices.
Separately, a federal appeals court has ruled Apple and Samsung don't have to make smartphone-related financial details submitted to a court handling one of their patent suits available for public viewing. The ruling reverses a lower court's judgment on the matter.

 Reuters adds to earlier speculation about China Mobile (CHL) awarding initial contracts worth a total of 20B yuan ($3.2B) for the expansion of its 4G network. Ericsson (ERIC), Alcatel-Lucent (ALU) and Nokia's (NOK) NSN have each won deals worth around 10% of the total tender. China's Huawei and ZTE have obtained 25% each. Some of these numbers are different from the previous speculation. The build-out of China Mobile's 4G network should help further pave the way for the mobile carrier, which has over 700M customers, to finally strike a deal with Apple (AAPL), whose upcoming devices are expected to support the operator's 4G TD-LTE technology.

Ex-WSJ reporter Jessica Lessin, who recently reported Apple's purchase of chipmaker Passif, is now reporting Apple (AAPL) has bought Embark, a developer of apps (I, II) that provide public transit info and trip-planning tools for several major U.S. cities (NYC, Chicago, San Francisco, etc.). An Apple spokeswoman has confirmed the deal.
If the description for Embark sounds familiar, it might be because it strongly resembles the one for HopStop, a transit app developer whose acquisition by Apple was confirmed last month.
Apple, intent on improving the quality of the oft-criticized Apple Maps and narrowing Google Maps' local/public transit data lead, also recently bought point-of-interest database developer Locationary.
Google, of course, isn't standing still either. It just added Waze's traffic alerts to its Maps apps.

Quartz reports Apple (AAPL -0.7%) is talking with ESPN, HBO, and Viacom, among others, about deals to "provide content for a television set that would emphasize apps over cable TV."
Sources think Apple could be planning to create its own Web-based TV service (Intel and Sony have similar plans), but also caution "everybody is talking with everybody." They add Apple has "concluded that it doesn’t need all, even most, content providers on board before it can release a TV set that people would buy."

Past reports indicated Apple has tried to license TV channels for a la carte distribution, only to be stymied by network owners scared of alienating pay-TV providers and upending a profitable status quo.
Yesterday, Bloomberg reported ESPN is thinking of licensing its channels to Web TV providers, but apparently for packages similar to those offered by pay-TV clients.
Taiwan's Economic Daily News recently reported Apple is working with Foxconn and Corning (GLW +0.1%) on creating 55" and 60" TV sets (translation) sporting edge-to-edge Gorilla Glass panels.

UBS' Steve Milunovich has raised his Apple (AAPL +0.8%) PT to $560 from $500 (he's the latest in a string of analysts to announce a PT hike), and predicts a China Mobile (CHL -0.9%) deal will arrive by year's end.
Milunovich, who is also raising his FY14 and FY15 EPS estimates, predicts CHL will sell 17M iPhones in Apple's FY14 (with the much-rumored iPhone 5C accounting for 70% of them), and in doing so boost Apple's EPS by $3.25 (each additional 1M units are estimated to add $0.20).
He thinks the 5C will carry an unsubsidized price of $399; KGI Securities recently predicted a $400-$500 price.
Yesterday, Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty, never shy to make optimistic Apple forecasts, predicted the 5C could boost Apple's Chinese smartphone share by 1300-1900 bps (the exact amount depending on a CHL deal), even at a "pricing sweet spot" of $486. Some of that share will probably have to be taken from sub-$250 Android phones; Chinese demand for them has skyrocketed.

Sources tell AdAge iTunes Radio (AAPL -1.3%) will launch next month, and that McDonald's, Procter & Gamble, Pepsi, and Nissan are among the initial ad partners.
The ad deals are said to "range from the high single-digit millions of dollars to tens of millions of dollars," involve 12-month campaigns, and include exclusivity for specific industries until year's end.
Video and audio ads are covered, as are display ads "that will take over whatever screen the consumer is using." Audio ads run every 15 minutes, and video ads every hour.
The reported ETA coincides with the expected launch dates for the iPhone 5S/5C and iOS 7.

In June, Apple announced iTunes Radio will include both a free, ad-supported service, and an ad-free service that's bundled with $25/year iTunes Match subscriptions.

Bloomberg reports Carl Icahn's just-disclosed Apple (AAPL +4.7%) stake is north of $1B (implies a ~0.25% stake ... for now), and that he expects shares to top $600.
During a CNBC talk, Icahn expressed confidence about Apple's future in the post-Steve Jobs era. Oracle CEO and close Jobs friend Larry Ellison offered a different take yesterday.

 Apple (AAPL) and Samsung (SSNLF.PK) are due to face each other today in two rounds of their long-running global patent battle. A federal appeals court is due to decide whether to ban over two dozen Samsung mobile devices after a jury last year found that they breached a number of Apple patents. In the case, the jury ordered Samsung to pay $1B in damages, an amount that a judge reduced to $599M. Over at the International Trade Commission (ITC), officials are set to discuss whether to uphold a preliminary finding that Samsung's products violated Apple patents. If the ITC does stick with the initial verdict, it could order a ban on the devices. A decision to bar Samsung products could boost Apple in its various patent disputes with other companies as well as with Samsung. However, given that the White House last week overturned a prohibition on certain Apple products, any ban on Samsung may not be implemented. |Aug. 8, 2013, 6:55 PM|Report: Apple board pressuring Cook over "pace of innovation"

High-res images purporting to show the low-cost iPhone's rear plastic shell have leaked. Also, images posted by a French site indicate the iPhone 5S will have an improved LED flash (perhaps a dual-LED flash).
AppleInsider's Daniel Eran Dilger takes a look at the advanced fingerprint sensor tech (developed by AuthenTec) that will reportedly be built into the iPhone 5S' home button.

A CIRP survey of U.S. consumers finds less than 1/3 of first-time smartphone buyers purchase an iPhone, as compared with nearly 50% of existing smartphone owners.

IDC estimates Apple's (AAPL) 14.6M calendar Q2 iPad sales were good for a 32.4% tablet share, down from Q1's 39.6% and the year-ago period's 60.3%. Android (GOOG) tablets are given a combined 62.6% share, up from 56.5% in Q1 and 38% a year ago.
Apple is still the market's biggest OEM. #2 Samsung (SSNLF.PK) is assigned an 18% share on 8.1M shipments vs. a 17.9% share in Q1 and just 7.6% a year ago.
Windows 8/RT (MSFT) are given a 4.5% share on 2M shipments vs. a 3.7% share on 1.8M shipments in Q1. Over the weekend, Microsoft cut Surface Pro prices by $100 through Aug. 29.

Strategy Analytics has estimated the iPad had a 28.3% share in Q2 vs. 47.2% a year ago, and Canalys has given it a 42.7% share vs. 71.2% a year ago. The firms respectively peg Android's share at 67% and 53%.
IDC thinks total tablet shipments (not the same as end-user sales) rose 60% Y/Y in Q2 to 45.1M. That's a marked slowdown from Q1's 142% growth. The firm sees 2H tablet launches fueling a growth pickup Strategy Analytics and Canalys both put Q2 shipment growth at 43%.

IDC has estimated 2013 tablet shipments will rise 59% to 229.3M.

 The Department of Justice doesn't just want to limit Apple's (AAPL) influence in the book-publishing market, it is also seeking oversight of the company's iTunes and App Store, which would give content owners increased leverage in negotiations. The government wants to prevent Apple from forging deals with partners that would raise the prices at which the firm's competitors sell music, TV shows or movies, as well as e-books. Apple has called the DOJ's proposals a "draconian and punitive intrusion into Apple's business, wildly out of proportion to any adjudicated wrongdoing or potential harm." |Aug. 2, 2013, 6:39 PM|9to5 Mac: Mansfield's role at Apple reduced at his request

Mansfield's other responsibilities are being split between hardware SVP Dan Riccio (designated as Mansfield's successor before he came out of retirement) and operations SVP Jeff Williams.
9to5 observes delegating some of Mansfield's responsibilities to Riccio means all iPhone/iPad engineering will be "under one roof" instead of being split between multiple teams.

The DOJ wants Apple (AAPL +0.3%) to terminate its existing deals with five top book publishers, and to "refrain for five years from entering new e-book distribution contracts which would restrain Apple from competing on price."
It also wants Apple to be "prohibited from again serving as a conduit of information among the conspiring publishers," and from entering into content deals that are likely to raise competitor content prices.
In a positive for Amazon (AMZN -0.3%) and Barnes & Noble (BKS -0.1%), the DOJ also proposes Apple allow e-book rivals to "provide links from their e-book apps to their e-bookstores" for two years. Such a requirement would give Amazon and B&N a way to sell e-books on iDevices without giving Apple a 30% cut. Amazon has been trying to avoid paying Apple via its Kindle Web apps, but that's an imperfect workaround at best.

Sources tell ex-WSJ reporter Jessica Lessin Apple (AAPL +0.7%) has acquired Passif Semiconductor, a chipmaker developing radios for the low-power Bluetooth LE (i.e. Bluetooth SMART) standard, which was created with embedded and wearable computing applications in mind.
Two weeks ago, the FT reported Apple is ramping its iWatch design/engineering efforts. Passif's chips are a logical fit for them.
The acquisition is noteworthy for Broadcom (BRCM +0.2%), given the company is the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/GPS combo chip supplier for the iPhone and iPad, and has been developing its own low-power Bluetooth parts.

Pac Crest recently stated there's a growing risk Apple will abandon Broadcom in favor of home-grown combo chips, given Apple's hiring activity and Texas Instruments' $315M sale of wireless connectivity IP to an unnamed OEM (believed by some to be Apple). If Apple wishes to ditch Broadcom, Passif could provide one piece to the puzzle, but only that.

Update: Apple confirms it has bought Passif.

"Mass production" of an iPad Mini (AAPL +0.9%) sporting a retina display made by Samsung (SSNLF.PK), Sharp (SHCAY.PK), and LG Display (LPL) will reportedly start in Q4. No word on whether the device will also launch in the quarter, or in Q1 2014, as others (I, II) have suggested.

9to5 Mac just reported iOS 7 SDK code indicates a non-retina Mini is also on tap. Will Apple offer a non-retina model for less than $300 to take on cheaper, share-gaining, 7" Android tablets?
Recent reports have also indicated Apple, in spite of its obvious differences with Samsung, plans to continue using the company as a chip foundry partner (along with TSMC), and will rely on it to supply thin LCD glass.
AU Optronics (AUO +3%), which (together with LG Display) supplies LCDs for the current Mini, reportedly won't be a retina Mini supplier.

Developer Hamza Sood has uncovered code that appears to confirm rumors the iPhone 5S' (AAPL +1.8%) home button will have a built-in fingerprint sensor.
Tim Cook reportedly traveled to China this week to meet with China Telecom's (CHA +0.3%) leadership. No details on what was discussed; chances are CHA will be a major buyer of the low-cost iPhone.
In a "final office action," the USPTO has rejected 21 claims within Apple's pinch-to-zoom patent. Look for Apple to appeal the ruling. In June, the USPTO reaffirmed the validity of a claim in Apple's "rubber-banding" patent after previously invalidating it.
Leaked photo cases and a BI source indicate the low-cost iPhone will be called the iPhone 5C. "C" is meant to stand for "color," though as BI notes, critics could refer to it as standing for "cheap."
Sprint sold 1.4M iPhones in Q2, down from 1.5M in Q1 and a year ago. For reference, Verizon sold 3.9M iPhones in Q2, and AT&T at least 3.7M.

Mansfield, Apple's long-time hardware engineering head, temporarily announced his retirement last year, only to be lured back (reportedly following employee discontent over his departure) and given a bigger role as part of Tim Cook's Oct.

Google got 31% of paid clicks from mobile (a sign Enhanced Campaigns are helping?) vs. 19% for Bing and Yahoo. Monetization still lags, but (as suggested by other reports) the gap is narrowing; mobile rose to 22% of ad spend, fueled by 165% and 261% Y/Y increases in tablet and smartphone spend. Moreover, tablet ad prices were roughly even with PC prices; smartphone prices remained 40% lower. One problem for Google: iOS made up 69% of mobile traffic, and Google has to give Apple (AAPL) a big cut on much of it.         |Jul. 12, 2013, 10:03 AM|Google's (GOOG -0.3%) relationship with Apple (AAPL +0.2%) has improved over the last year, and the tech giants are in "constant business discussions on a long list of issues," says Eric Schmidt. In spite of their differences, Apple and Google remain quite dependent on each other, and the WSJ reported in April Apple is reluctant to end its iOS search deal with Google. Also: 1) Schmidt predicts commercial use of Google's self-driving tech is years, rather than decades, away, and states Google has talked to "every single car company." 2) Digitimes reports the next-gen Nexus 7 will launch in late July or early August; it's expected to sport a 1980x1200 display, and Wi-Fi-only models will reportedly be priced at $199-$249.|Jul. 11, 2013, 12:30 PM|Verizon Wireless (VZ, VOD) is obligated to buy a whopping $23.5B worth of iPhones from Apple (AAPL) this year, about twice as many as it sold in 2012, thinks former Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett after going over SEC filings (Vodafone's 20-F appears to be the source). Moffett estimates Verizon, which he believes has fallen short of its iPhone purchase commitments each year since it began selling the phone in 2011, could end up owing Apple $12B-$14B at year's end, given sales trends. Moffett: "It isn’t clear that Apple has any incentive to blow up [its Verizon] relationship by taking a hard line ...

Also, while Apple claims $6B in FY12 federal tax payments, the report claims the real number is $2.4B if one backs out deferred payments on foreign cash (only paid if/when the cash is repatriated).|May 20, 2013, 4:03 PM|Apple (AAPL) releases Tim Cook's official statement (.pdf) to the Senate ahead of his Tuesday appearance at a hearing on corporate tax payments.

That trend could spell trouble for AT&T (T) and Verizon Wireless (VZ, VOD), whose recent growth has been heavily tied to selling costly postpaid data plans. With 72% and 61% of the carriers' postpaid bases now respectively on smartphones, they face pressure to gain prepaid buyers without cannibalizing postpaid subs. Cannibalization fears have led AT&T and Verizon to make their prepaid plans 3G-only; Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS) offer 4G.

The big question for Apple is whether an iPhone 5S that keeps a 4" display (as has been reported) will lead to a major sales pickup in the face of growing demand for larger displays, and the upcoming launch of Samsung's Galaxy S IV. However, an early 5S release would suggest an accelerated launch for an iPhone 6 rumored to have a bigger display.|Mar. 8, 2013, 12:03 PM|Evidence is growing an iPhone 5S (AAPL +0.4%) will arrive around mid-year.

Wedge Partners: "We understand Foxconn is currently prepping production lines for ... iPhone 5S production, which we believe is scheduled to begin in the April timeframe." The firm thinks the 5S will be unveiled at the WWDC conference (typically in June), with sales likely starting in July.
