Morgan analyst says

 General Electric (GE -1.6%) is giving back most of its Friday gains that were sparked by a Fox Business report that CEO Jeffrey Immelt is "in the hot seat" with Nelson Peltz and his Trian Fund. GE shares have lagged the market for the past 15 years, advancing just 0.4% annually including reinvested dividends vs. a 7% return for the S&P 500, and Barclays discussed an unnamed investor’s view that the stock could gain 5% from a CEO change, along with various other reasons to like the stock.But J.P. Morgan's Stephen Tusa thinks the stock has struggled not because of execution or something the CEO has done wrong, but "because of the stubbornly low growth and secular challenges embedded in end markets where a company of this size is forced to play, as evidenced by limited profit growth despite $8B of restructuring and significant gains since 2012."Even so, Tusa prefers Danaher (DHR -0.6%), which "gets a multiple because it generates cash and redeploys into growth from a base of revenue that is 15% of what GE is, and recently even shrunk the portfolio to reset the growth trajectory." |Fri, Mar. 10, 12:38 PM|Fox: Immelt on hot seat with Peltz; GE up nearly 2%

 General Electric (GE -0.1%) is reiterated with an Outperform rating and $34 stock price target at Credit Suisse, which says the GE Power business is poised for a recovery despite the weak heavy duty gas turbine environment, as GE is taking advantage of its broader suite of products post-Alstom. Credit Suisse says the Power segment continues to be the main driver behind GE’s cash conversion improvement, and the unit has laid out a plan to improve its conversion by 15% this year.The firm also cites continued strong results in Renewables, with double-digit organic revenue and operating profit growth, and notes GE's sale of the Water business to Suez came in at a higher price and multiple than initial expectations.Although shares have been weak for the last 12 months, Credit Suisse thinks "the pro-cyclical cross-sector rotation has largely run its course, and GE is running out of shoes to drop."|Wed, Mar. 8, 6:26 PM|GE’s Immelt sees pay package fall to $21.3M last year

The CEO points to a "deep skepticism toward the ideas that have powered economic expansion of the industry for a generation, with concepts such as innovation, productivity and globalization being challenged and protectionism on the rise." “GE is a global company today and in the future,” even as it remains "a proud American company" that is creating jobs in the U.S., Immelt says; while GE’s sales have shifted from ~70% in the U.S. in 2000 to less than half today, the CEO says the company's $20B/year in exports keeps domestic factories churning.|Thu, Feb. 23, 5:15 AM|Suez in bidding for GE Water

 Leading U.S. exporters launch a coalition in support of a House Republican plan for a "border adjustment" tax on all imports. The "American Made Coalition" includes more than 25 U.S. companies, including General Electric (NYSE:GE), Boeing (NYSE:BA), Dow Chemical (NYSE:DOW), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL). "American workers and businesses are not competing today on a level playing field with foreign competitors because of an outdated and unfair tax system," says a spokesperson for the group. The group's launch underscores a division in corporate America over the proposal that  would cut corporate income tax to 20% from 35%, exclude  export revenue from taxable income and impose a 20% tax on  imports. Retailers, oil refiners and foreign automakers have been lobbying against any big tax on imports, which they say would hurt their sales and profits and put them at a disadvantage to rivals more reliant on U.S.-made products. |Wed, Feb. 1, 5:11 AM|GE to sell entire stake in Hyundai Card

 GE tumbled 2.2% in today's trade as Q4 revenue fell 2.4% Y/Y, with organic revenue in industrial businesses sliding 1% and coming in below the company's 0%-2% growth forecast and after having to reduce revenue forecasts throughout the year. Analysts question whether the Q4 results could mean GE will miss the 2017  target of 3%-5% growth that the company reaffirmed today, but with Alstom revenue included - as it will be in future quarters - hitting  the revenue target "doesn't look like a stretch," says RBC analyst Deane Dray. Noting GE's overall organic revenue rose 4% in the quarter, CEO Jeffrey Immelt said in today's earnings conference call that felt "pretty secure" about the 2017 target. Q4 revenue in GE's oil and gas business sank 22%, but the decline was expected amid weak market conditions. GE’s Q4 industrial operating cash flow of $8.2B made it the "biggest cash quarter in our history,” Immelt said. Bloomberg's Brooke Sutherland writes hopefully that GE stands to benefit from tax reform and plans for infrastructure stimulus, and the stock's gains have not kept pace with the broader post-election rally, indicating some skepticism may have been baked in and leaving some room to rise. |Fri, Jan. 20, 7:14 AM|GE dips as revenues miss, earnings match

On PNR, given low expectations set in October and less stock appreciation due to an already low tax rate, the firm sees potential for relative upside to organic growth in a better economy and less downside in a sluggish/steady-state economy, all at an attractive discount.

The judge said the "plain language" of the 2014 sales contract justified letting Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu handle the matter first, rather than arbitrators from the International Chamber of Commerce. Alstom had sued GE for breach of contract for refusing to let the accounting firm decide whether the purchase price should be adjusted up or down to account for working capital and net debt. |Tue, Jan. 10, 8:00 AM|Blackstone looks to buy another division of GE

 General Electric (GE +0.6%) opens higher even as J.P.

GE bulls anticipate a favorable tax environment for the company under a Trump administration, but Tusa believes that even at zero, the tax impact for GE is only slightly more positive than the average for its peer group, given the limited benefits from a tax repatriation.”Fundamentally, we see more downside than upside" for GE, and fundamentals "will matter more than any one-time step up," Tusa writes. |Dec. 30, 2016, 3:37 PM|GE deals may point toward possible succession

 Dealmaking at General Electric (GE -0.4%) could point the way toward a possible line of succession, suggests Rob Cox, noting that merging with Alstom and Baker Hughes provides some clues to the company's path forward. Jeff Immelt doesn't have current plans to retire, but is 60, opening up investor speculation. Meanwhile, an Alstom deal suggests that Steve Bolze (in charge of the power division) may be in pole position. "Shortly after absorbing Alstom, GE more than doubled its targeted cost savings from the French company to $3 billion," Cox notes. "If these pan out over the next year or two, Mr. Bolze will be hard to beat for Mr. Immelt’s seat." Lorenzo Simonelli, who leads the oil and gas division integrating Baker Hughes, isn't far behind: "It is a complicated arrangement that presents a dramatic new blueprint should GE one day abandon its conglomerate structure." |Dec. 29, 2016, 4:25 PM|Q3 S&P 500 share repurchases decline 12% Q/Q, 25.5% Y/Y

The analyst also sees “a new set of catalysts in the form of potential tax reform, regulatory relief and other factors that should lift GE's businesses beyond 2018.”|Dec. 15, 2016, 2:45 PM|Analyst reaction mixed following GE's $2 earnings target for 2018

 Analysts are cautiously optimistic that General Electric (GE -1%) can achieve its earnings goal after the company reaffirmed its $2/share target for 2018 and offered a "high bar" forecast for revenue gains of 3%-5% next year. Goldman Sachs analyst Jon Ritchie maintains his Neutral rating and $31 price target, saying it is more positive on GE's margin trajectory and the progress on reorienting  the company (digital, divesting non-core assets), but seeing downside to GE's 2018 EPS  target and viewing current valuation as  reasonable for a stock with below average EBIT growth over 2016-18. Barclays rates GE at Outperform and lifts its stock price target to $36 from $32, even as "numbers this year have just been OK, cash generation light, and the ramp to 2018 numbers is steep." Raising its target price to $37 from $36, RBC says it liked hearing that GE still has ~$10B of "unallocated" leverage capacity. |Dec. 14, 2016, 5:58 PM|GE eyes sale of two smaller industrial units, another $1B in cost cuts

 More from GE's analyst day: The company says it plans to raise $4B by selling two of its smaller industrial units and promises to cut another $1B in expenses. GE expects to sell its Industrial Solutions business, which supplies equipment to the electrical distribution and grid industries, and its GE Water business; the two units combined account for ~$5B in annual revenue. CEO Jeffrey Immelt says GE will be seeking ways to cut costs in the short run by shrinking its footprint and closing some facilities, the type of corporate actions that have triggered backlash from Pres.-elect Trump. Immelt also says GE has grown its foreign businesses twice as much as its domestic business over the last 15 years, and has sold 85% of its jet engines and gas-fired power turbines overseas.

U.S.-based industrial companies such as Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR), Fortive (NYSE:FTV), 3M (NYSE:MMM) and Danaher (NYSE:DHR) could enjoy sizable benefits from potential tax changes that could occur next year, as well as increased capital spending, Bernstein analyst Steven Winoker writes.The potential EPS upside of U.S. tax reform should reach double digits for the four companies, while Eaton (NYSE:ETN) - already at a group-low ~10% global effective tax rate - should see only minimal upside, according to Winoker, who notes that tax deductibility of capex investment also would spark spending in the U.S.Bernstein's covered companies derive between 10% (3M) and 60%-plus (Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK)) of revenues from customers’ capex spending, so the impact could be meaningful; the firm rates Allegion (NYSE:ALLE), DHR, Dover (NYSE:DOV), FTV, Honeywell (NYSE:HON), Ingersoll-Rand (NYSE:IR), Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) and Pentair (NYSE:PNR) at Outperform, with EMR, ETN, General Electric (NYSE:GE), Idex (NYSE:IEX), MMM and ROK at Market Perform.|Dec. 12, 2016, 11:04 AM|GE makes progress with 3D printing investments

The combination of General Electric's (GE +0.8%) oil and gas business with Baker Hughes (BHI +0.4%) has the potential to challenge Schlumberger (SLB +0.2%), but "it's a long-term game," Bernstein analysts say.Following yesterday’s investor meeting, the Bernstein boys say they are more convinced by the merger's long-term potential but remain cautious on delivery timing; while the long-term potential and revenue enhancement concepts dominated the meeting, the firm says little information was revealed on timing beyond the already published synergy estimates.Bernstein agrees conceptually with management that GE-BHI will challenge SLB for large-scale, integrated, at-risk projects and leadership of new commercial models in E&P, but expects implementation will prove more challenging than conveyed at the investor meeting.|Dec. 9, 2016, 11:47 AM|General Electric boosts dividend by a penny

 Stifel analysts say they are “fundamentally cautious” on industrial stocks but call General Electric (GE -0.3%) and Ingersoll-Rand (IR +0.9%) their top picks among their Buy-rated stocks in the group in both a base case slow-and-steady low-growth environment as well as a pro-growth Trump rally. The firm considers GE a solid, quality defensive play with an attractive 3% yield and likely would be a prime beneficiary of a Trump bump, but also a strong defensive component in its aftermarket/services stream, which accounts for ~45% of revenues and 80% of profits.Stifel says the Baker Hughes should effectively de-risk GE’s oil and gas exposure and allow management to pursue large scale restructuring of a $30B business while providing additional balance sheet flexibility going forward. |Dec. 5, 2016, 6:55 PM|GE Power sees little sales impact even if U.S. quits climate deals

 Sales of power plant upgrades by General Electric (NYSE:GE) would not suffer much even if the U.S. bails out of climate change treaties under a Trump administration, Paul McElhinney, CEO of GE's power services business, tells Reuters. Utilities still want the economic benefits that come with modernizations, McElhinney says, predicting "very robust" demand for products that can lower emissions and increase efficiency. GE, which supports climate agreements, says global CO2 emissions could be cut by 10%, or 1.1M metric tons/year, if current technology to boost the efficiency of coal and gas-fired power plants were installed in every plant now operating; the company says such upgrades cost ~55M for a coal plant and $10M for a natural gas plant.

Global Laser Enrichment has not made a formal decision to proceed with licensing or construction of the facility. GLE is 62.5% owned by GE-Hitachi, which is 60% owned by General Electric and 40% by Hitachi, resulting in indirect interests in GLE of 37.5% by GE and 25% by Hitachi.

 It's time to buy Baker Hughes (BHI -0.2%) now that the dust has settled regarding the company's merger with General Electric's (GE +0.6%) oil and gas business, Guggenheim analysts say. Guggenheim estimates the new company will generate $4.9B in EBITDA in 2018 - a bit less than the $5.2B-$5.5B forecast by the companies - and should trade at a peer average 10.6x EBITDA, implying a fair value for BHI of ~$63, but the firm believes synergies provide another ~$4 of upside if GE is able to realize greater cost savings. The firm also finds the industrial logic is sound: As Schlumberger (SLB -0.1%) has shown, regional and product line diversity enhance through-cycle returns and cash flow, which are benefits that the new BHI should be able to realize as a result of its pro forma portfolio. |Nov. 7, 2016, 3:19 PM|In update, General Electric says it is paying $76/share for Baker Hughes

 Citigroup analysts believe the deal between General Electric (NYSE:GE) and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) strikes a good balance for GE and BHI, as GE is not selling at the bottom, valuation seems fair for BHI shareholders, and GE management retains control to roll out its digital and service focus across a much broader oil and gas platform. Citi views the deal (I, II, III) favorably, as it "reflects deployment of a meaningful portion of the ~$20B in incremental leverage GE had noted as available for transactions over the next few years," but valuation is reasonable and "the deal enhances [GE]’s visibility to EPS growth over the next several years." The firm also notes BHI’s weak stock showing, likely given concerns that GE’s "non-cash contribution to the deal (in the form of 37.5% of GE oil and gas) doesn’t provide enough value to Baker Hughes shareholders – we think that concern will diminish over time" given the improved competitive and cost position of the combined company. Simmons analyst Bill Herbert cites another likely reason for BHI's 6.3% swoon in today's trade: The new partnership leaves the company more leveraged to deepwater and international projects, which are not as flexible as the U.S. onshore business.|Oct. 31, 2016, 3:27 PM|GE to sell its water business even as it raises bet on oil and gas

 Almost as an afterthought in unveiling the merger of its oil and gas unit with Baker Hughes, General Electric (GE -0.1%) said it would sell its GE Water business, a move WSJ's Spencer Jakab calls "self-preservation." Both the water and the oil and gas businesses have been disappointing for GE, Jakab writes, but dumping the water business may be a matter of the number of losers that CEO Jeffrey Immelt can justify to activists such as Trian Fund: "Water might have paid off in the long run... but with GE raising its bet on oil, water just didn’t fit into the mix." Elsewhere, Bernstein analyst Steven Winoker says the deal with Baker Hughes is “positive strategically” for GE shareholders, and is an attractive structure for GE, noting that without requiring a full cash outlay for BHI, the new company provides GE shareholders with additional upside to an oil price recovery. Evercore analysts note the deal likely provides an avenue for GE to promote the widespread adoption of its Predix industrial internet platform, a focal point of the company’s long term strategy. Moody’s keeps its A1 credit rating for GE, saying increased exposure in oil and gas initially is credit negative but will pay out over an extended time horizon. |Oct. 31, 2016, 10:30 AM|Baker Hughes, GE shares head in opposite directions as deal sinks in

 Baker Hughes (BHI -1%) erases opening gains to trade in the red, while General Electric (GE +0.9%) is higher amid plans to combine their oil and gas operations. The new company will be 62.5% owned by GE, with GE Oil & Gas CEO Lorenzo Simonelli serving as President and CEO; GE will fund a special one-time cash dividend of $17.50/share, or $7.4B, to existing BHI shareholders, who will own 37.5% of the new company. The deal creates a company with more than $32B in FY 2015 revenue that could cut costs to better compete with rivals such as Schlumberger (SLB -0.9%) to provide equipment and services to oil rigs and wells; the $32B combined revenue places the new company only 8%-9% behind SLB. The combined companies expect to generate $1.6B of synergies by 2020, primarily driven by cost savings; GE expects the deal to be accretive to 2018 EPS by $0.04 and 2020 EPS by $0.08. Analysts see a high likelihood of the deal's completion given little product overlap outside of the Artificial Lift business and the relatively smaller size of the deal vs. the rejected Halliburton-Baker Hughes (HAL -0.5%) tie-up. Moody’s, Fitch and S&P all affirmed GE’s credit ratings with stable outlooks following the announcement. |Oct. 31, 2016, 6:25 AM|GE to merge oil and gas ops with Baker Hughes

The companies reportedly are negotiating a complicated transaction, perhaps involving merging GE’s oil and gas business with Baker Hughes, which provides oilfield services, and then spinning off the combined business into a new public company. Any Reverse Morris Trust deal would allow GE to avoid a big tax bill and allow shareholders to reap any cost savings or other benefits from putting the two businesses together, as well as any upside from a rebound in oil prices.|Oct. 27, 2016, 7:52 PM|GE: No 'outright purchase' of Baker Hughes; BHI now up 6.9%

 An engine failure on a Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) last month released debris that tore a 5"x16" hole in the plane before it made a safe emergency landing in Pensacola, Fla., crash investigators at the NTSB said today. In an update to its probe of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737's  rare engine failure, the U.S. agency said a fan blade separated from the engine and was not recovered,  except for the base of the blade that was still attached to the aircraft; the investigation update still has not solved the precise cause of the "uncontained" engine failure. The Aug. 27 flight, bound from New Orleans to Orlando with 99 passengers and five crew members aboard, lost cabin pressure and safely diverted to Pensacola; there were no injuries.

GE's $1.4B purchase of a pair of 3D-printer companies sent stocks in the group soaring in today's trade, with 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) closing +5.5%, Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) +3.7%, Voxeljet (NYSE:VJET) +4.6% and ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE) +5.8%. But GE closed 0.7% lower, as analysts say that while 3D printing is promising, GE’s acquisitions are a “net negative” because there are relatively few short-term benefits. “This seems like a relatively outsized and expensive bet, with no near-term return, and an incremental opportunity cost when considering the ongoing debate around what we view as finite balance sheet capacity,” says J.P. Morgan's Steve Tusa. Cowen analyst Gautam Khanna takes a longer view, saying that “while the deals appear pricey, they help position GE to lead, implement and control additive manufacturing processes that will become important cost-reduction levers long term in Aviation and elsewhere." As for the 3-D companies, Citigroup’s Kenneth Wong says that while the GE deal does not present any immediate competition for them, it does not necessarily suggest any buyout implications for the companies since GE is focusing on metal applications. |Sep. 6, 2016, 11:40 AM|WisdomTree Equity Income ETF (DHS) August Summary

 General Electric (GE -0.5%) plans to install 500 wind turbines in Brazil next  year, bringing its installations there to 2,600, or 37% of  the country’s expected 2017 total, but is having difficulty closing new contracts amid the country’s economic slump, according to Jean-Claude Fernand Robert, GE’s head of wind in Latin America.
Robert believes the economic crisis in Brazil is "a phase," but the weak economy has hurt demand for power, driving down interest  in new power supply deals; Brazil has planned three power auctions this year, compared with seven last year, an April auction saw no bids offered  for wind farm contracts.
Brazil needs to add ~2 GW/year of power to support existing turbine factories and other suppliers, GE says.
GE is Brazil’s top wind turbine supplier, and its turbines account for 40% of the country’s installed wind capacity, based on megawatts. |Aug. 30, 2016, 4:47 PM|GE to buy software company to boost rail industry supply chain

 Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY +0.3%) and Gamesa (OTCPK:GCTAF) have rejected a non-binding offer from General Electric (GE +0.3%) for assets belonging to the Adwen wind power joint venture between Gamesa and Areva (OTCPK:ARVCF), Reuters reports. Gamesa is merging with Siemens' wind power division to create the world's biggest builder of wind farms in a €10B ($11 billion) deal, but the Adwen venture has been a sticking point, as Siemens does not need the technology from Areva because it has developed its own offshore wind turbines. If Areva does not find a buyer before a mid-September deadline set when Siemens and Gamesa announced their merger in June, the most likely outcome would be for Gamesa to exercise its purchase option and take over Areva's 50% stake, according to the report. |Aug. 30, 2016, 8:57 AM|GE Capital CEO retiring from company

 The U.S. government's top offshore drilling regulator is warning subsea oil drillers and equipment makers that bolt failures in the Gulf of Mexico could result in an oil spill on the scale of the Deepwater Horizon disaster. Regulators and makers of oil production equipment - including General Electric (NYSE:GE), Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) - are trying to determine what is causing the problems, which have been found over the past four years on safety equipment in underwater oil production, including on blowout preventers, which are designed as a last defense against a major oil spill such as the 2010 Deepwater Horizon incident. The offshore drilling industry had discussed possibly replacing all the bolts in question in the Gulf over a period of years, but Brian Salerno, director of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, says the  discussions have ended after a better understanding of the problem.
GE issued a  global recall after its bolts on a piece of undersea equipment in the  Gulf of Mexico failed in 2012, an incident that was reported to the government, but government officials say many more were not, masking the extent of the problem. |Aug. 29, 2016, 6:43 AM|China unveils aircraft engine-maker

 General Electric's (NYSE:GE) seven-year, $1.6B dredging campaign to remove industrial pollutants from the Hudson River has been inadequate, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation says in a letter urging the federal EPA to closely scrutinize the effectiveness of dredging in its project review due to be released by April 2017. At least 136 acres of river bottom and 35% of the PCBs discharged from a pair of GE factories along the Hudson near Albany have not been removed, the state agency says, adding that it has asked permission from the Army  Corps of Engineers to dredge the Champlain Canal, which runs into and at  times is a channel of the upper Hudson. New York's move could pose a new PCB-related headache for GE, which has been eager to move past the cleanup obligations that have long dogged the company.
