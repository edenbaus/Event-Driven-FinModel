What's likely to be a strong Q1 is already priced in, says analyst Charles Peabody, and his outlook for the rest of the year is for very little EPS growth.The stock's nearly doubled over the past nine months, but a lot of that was thanks to higher interest rates, and that's been priced in as well. Interest rate normalization affects costs as well, and those might double under the new regime.Helping to support shares could be aggressive buybacks.His $20 price target suggests more than 20% downside from the current $25.33.BAC +0.6% today 

Today, 1:11 PM|Yesterday, 2:33 PM|Banks head lower following rate hike

The major averages, bonds, and gold have all turned higher after the Fed lifted the Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points, but satiated bank bulls might be lightening up just a hair.After all, the "dots" showed the Fed as being no more hawkish than a couple of meetings back when it surprised the world by predicting three rate hikes this year. Inflation and growth expectations were essentially unchanged as well.So while the Fed may have been faster with a rate hike than many expected just a couple of weeks back, it appears the timetable past today remains the same.KBE -0.15%, KRE -0.1%, XLF flatJanet Yellen's press conference is just getting underway.Bank of America (BAC -0.2%), Citigroup (C -0.6%), JPMorgan (JPM +0.3%), Wells Fargo (WFC +0.1%), Goldman Sachs (GS +0.1%), U.S. Bancorp (USB +0.3%), PNC Financial (PNC -0.4%), KeyCorp (KEY +0.2%), Regions Financial (RF), SunTrust (STI -1%), Fifth Third (FITB -0.7%)ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, BTO, IYG, FNCL, SEF, FXO, RYF, FINU, RWW, XLFS, FINZ, JHMF, FAZZ, FNCF

For now, Washington D.C. is winning the battle against those in favor of quickly rolling back swaths of Dodd-Frank. For now, the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee are working on other things, while Republicans instead spend political capital on things like Obamacare repeal and tax reform.Barney Frank is taking a victory lap, telling Bloomberg nothing substantial will get through Congress. He does expect the possibility of relief for smaller banks, but the likes of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and others probably shouldn't be holding their breath for big changes.KBW's Brian Gardner: “Changes to the Dodd-Frank Act are second-tier agenda items and are unlikely to pass Congress in the near term ... Improvement in the regulatory regime is likely to be subtle and not seen by the public."

"Some people have come close to calling [buybacks] un-American - characterizing them as corporate misdeeds that divert funds needed for productive endeavors,” says Warren Buffett. "That simply isn't the case." If anything, he says, American corporations and private investors have too much cash looking to be "sensibly deployed." If anybody knows of an enticing project that's died for lack of capital of late, please drop a dime to Omaha, he urges.Where The Oracle does have an issue with buybacks are when corporate chiefs pay too much them. This isn't the case for Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), he says, where repurchased shares have been underpriced. Berkshire's (BRK.A, BRK.B) $5B preferred stake in BofA carries warrants allowing the purchase of 700M shares of common any time prior to Sept. 2021. While Buffett has said he's not planning on exercising until shortly before expiration, he now says he would exchange early into the common should the annual dividend (now $0.30 per share) rise to $0.44.He spends a sizable section of the letter attacking money-management fees. "When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients ... If a statue is ever erected to honor the person who has done the most for American investors, the hands down choice should be Jack Bogle."There's  still a few months to go, but Buffett also declares victory in his crisis-era bet that the S&P 500 would outperform a portfolio of funds of hedge funds over a 10-year period. Since, the compounded annual return for the S&P 500 has been 7.1% vs. 2.2% for the funds. Game over.As for Berkshire operations, The Oracle's preferred measure - book value - rose 10.7% in 2016 vs. the S&P 500's 12% return.

The number of suspicious activity reports rose to nearly 1M last year vs. 669K in 2013.Compliance with the rules is costing U.S. companies up to $8B per year, according to the Heritage Foundation.The new system to be proposed by The Clearing House envisions banks not investigating and reporting every red flag transaction, but instead looking into specific concerns relayed to them by law enforcement.

(CACC +1.9%) have found out. The House two years ago voted overwhelmingly voted to stop the CFPB's efforts in this area, but Elizabeth Warren was able to halt the bill in the Senate.The president, says Hensarling, should fire Richard Cordray yesterday, put in place a new director to undo all harmful actions taken by the agency, and then get to work putting policies to work that actually protect consumers.Even with better leadership, though, the CFPB would still be unconstitutional, he continues, so the agency must be "functionally terminated" through a simple majority vote to cut off funding (which comes from the Fed, not Congress).In other Hensarling news, Bloomberg has seen a memo outlining other Dodd-Frank reforms, including reducing stress tests to just every other year.XLF +1.3%, KRE +1.5%, KBE +1.3%OneMain (OMF +4.4%), BofA (BAC +1.6%), Citigroup (C +1.7%), Wells Fargo (WFC +1.7%), JPMorgan (JPM +1.3%), Goldman Sachs (GS +1.7%), Morgan Stanley (MS +2.2%), Regions (RF +2.7%), KeyCorp (KEY +1%), SunTrust (STI +1.6%), BB&T (BBT +1.1%), M&T (MTB +1.2%), Zions (ZION +2%)

Bank employees in Jacksonville earn about 30% less than those in The Big Apple.For workers, the cost of living is appreciably lower, commute times shorter, and a walk on the beach is possible at lunch.

JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) are among those giving price data to startup Vista Capital Advisors, which - working with Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) - plans to create indexes of MBS which could be used as the basis for derivatives.Source: Matt Scully at BloombergIn the pre-crisis era, derivatives based on the ABX indexes allowed massive bets on and against the U.S. housing market, eventually affording folks like John Paulson and his team even bigger Hamptons mansions, and causing the downfalls of shops like AIG which took the other side.These new derivatives, however, would be tied to higher quality mortgages then the subprime types favored prior to the property blowup. The new paper will be linked to what's known as "credit-risk transfer" securities issued by Fannie Mae (OTCQB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac (OTCQB:FMCC), which force losses on investors when borrowers default. Since 2013 when the GSEs began selling these, they've offloaded nearly $400B of risk to bond investors, theoretically lowering taxpayer risk.Vista has some heavy hitters backing it, including Dimensional Fund co-founder David Booth and former Citigroup chairman John Reed.

At least part of that is due to Citi's lower returns and sizable overseas exposure, they write.Should an activist get involved, it could come alongside the appointment of, say, Thomas Hoenig - a supporter of bringing back Glass-Steagall - as vice chair of the Fed (though word is Hoenig has moved to #2 on the depth chart for that spot).

Comerica, for instance, is up a tidy 85% Y/Y, including a 38% run over the last three months.The KRE is down 2.6% and the KBE down 2.5%.Bank of America (BAC -2.7%), JPMorgan (JPM -2.5%), Citigroup (C -1.8%), Goldman Sachs (GS -1.8%), U.S. Bancorp (USB -2.1%), Regions (RF -3.8%), KeyCorp (KEY -2.8%), PNC Financial (PNC -2.8%), SunTrust (STI -2.6%), Zions (ZION -3.2%).ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, BTO, IYG, FNCL, SEF, FXO, RYF, FINU, RWW, XLFS, FINZ, JHMF, FAZZ, FNCF

There was a bit of caution among bank investors in the past couple of days, but they're back to buying low and selling high this morning as the initial results from Q4 begin to pour in. Among those reporting today: Bank of America (BAC +1.8%), JPMorgan (JPM +1.9%), Wells Fargo (WFC +2.8%), PNC Financial (PNC +2.4%), First Horizon (FHN -0.3%).KBE +2.3%, KRE +2.5%; the S&P 500 is ahead 0.3%.An early take from KBW's Bose George: Mortgage banking trends are weakening in line with expectations - with stronger volumes being offset by lower gain-on-sale margins. Higher rates are still filtering through though, and industry sources and recent data suggest volumes falling 10-15% this quarter.Piper's Kevin Barker calls Wells Fargo's operating numbers "decent," but notes rising auto loan net charge-offs - 1.05% in Q4  vs. 0.87% in Q3, and 0.59% a year earlier.Bloomberg's Alison Williams takes note of the positive signal of boosted buybacks at Bank of America, and calls cost cuts "key." It's hard to get too excited about any particular metric given the bank's near-50% run higher in the past few months.Other players: Goldman (GS +1.1%), Morgan Stanley (MS +2%), Citigroup (C +1.6%), U.S. Bancorp (USB +1.3%), Regions Financial (RF +3.2%), New York Community (NYCB +1.3%), Huntington Bancshares (HBAN +2.2%), KeyCorp (KEY +2.3%)

The Q4 earnings beat was driven mostly by a lower tax rate and lower expenses, says Goldman Sachs in a quick first-take on Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) results. Core earnings of $0.37 compared to the Goldman's team estimate of $0.38.Goldman's bullish view on BofA remains largely intact thanks to leverage to higher rates and continued cost control. The stock is on the Conviction List with a $27 price target suggesting nearly another 20% of upside.Downside risks include a slower rise in interest rates and slower economic growth.Shares now lower by 0.85% premarket as satiated bulls use the earnings news as a reason to cash in some chips.Previously: BofA edges higher after topping bottom-line estimates (Jan. 13)Previously: Bank of America beats by $0.02, misses on revenue (Jan. 13)

According to the agency, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) ignored FDIC instructions over how to account for counterparty exposure.The FDIC sued the bank for at least $542M in payments for the last three quarters of 2013 and all of 2014. The total could go higher as the FDIC contends BofA owes more than $1B going back to 2011.It's a technical disagreement, says the bank, and the amounts being talked about are a fraction what's paid annually to the agency.This is likely to get resolved with a payment to the FDIC, says KBW's Brian Kleinhanzi, and it could impact book value by as much as $0.06 if the final charge is close to $1B.

Mid-sized companies "are frisker, they're more active," Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan tells Bloomberg, noting some have been drawing on credit lines to invest in operations. "They feel better about the prospects of the regulatory environment and their businesses. They feel better about the possibility of final demand.”These things take time though, and Moynihan isn't expecting an immediate big boost to the economy in 2017. BofA sees about 2% GDP growth next year vs. what's expected to be about 1.6% in 2016.As for regulatory rollback under a Trump administration, Moynihan - whose time atop BofA has been spent cleaning up the mess from the last bubble - says if the Volcker rule were eliminated tomorrow, the bank wouldn't change what it does.

 The Fed votes to adopt a bailout prevention rule that will force big banks to issue substantial amounts of new long-term debt, largely upholding a draft issued early this year. Half of the eight largest U.S. banks would need to issue ~$70B in fresh debt or equity to satisfy the new Total Loss Absorbing Capacity standard, the Fed estimates. In all, the Fed says U.S. banks’ funding costs would increase by $680M-$2B annually, higher than the upper estimate of $1.5B in its October 2015 proposal. Fed officials do not identify the four banks that lack sufficient debt; Wells Fargo (WFC +1.6%) said in November it envisioned issuing at least an additional $29B in debt to satisfy the rule. Besides WFC, the banks expected to satisfy the new rule are JPMorgan Chase (JPM +1.9%), Bank of America (BAC +2.6%), Citigroup (C +1.6%), State Street (STT +1.1%), BNY Mellon (BK +1.4%), Morgan Stanley (MS +0.9%) and Goldman Sachs (GS +1.7%).

The FRBNY's William Dudley isn't concerned about the post-election jump in rates at the long end of the curve, and says the Fed is about to start following suit at the short end.Even the dovish Charles Evans from the Chicago Fed admits inflation is getting closer to the central bank's target, and the labor market is close to full employment.The 10-year Treasury yield had moved as high as 2.45%, but has pulled back to 2.40%, still up 1.5 basis points on the session.On the regulatory front, Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo on Friday set himself up as the chief defender of the current bank regulatory regime, but whether his voice will be heard is a different story given the incoming administration, which looks to be staffed with those favoring a far lighter regulatory hand.Financial sector stocks today are about doubling the S&P 500's 0.5% advance.TBTF banks: Bank of America (BAC +2.3%), Citigroup (C +1.8%), JPMorgan (JPM +1.3%), Wells Fargo (WFC +0.9%), Goldman Sachs (GS +1.7%), Morgan Stanley (MS +0.4%)Regional lenders: U.S. Bancorp (USB +0.7%), PNC Financial (PNC +0.4%), KeyCorp (KEY -0.8%), Fifth Third (FITB +0.5%)Insurers: MetLife (MET +0.3%), Lincoln National (LNC), AIG (AIG +0.2%)Brokerage: Schwab (SCHW +0.9%), E*Trade (ETFC +0.9%)Custodial banks: State Street (STT +0.5%), Northern Trust (NTRS +1%)Private equity: Blackstone (BX +0.9%), KKR (KKR +1%)Asset Management: BlackRock (BLK +0.1%), Franklin Resources (BEN +0.5%), Affiliated Managers (AMG +1.8%)

There are multi-year highs again across the sector as interest rates continue to rise, but, maybe more importantly, bank investors begin to envision a far less heavy regulatory burden.In a speech Friday described by FBR's Ed Mills as "going out swinging," Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo set himself up as the chief defender of the status quo, saying he doesn't see a "sound economic case" for rolling back the post-crisis regulatory regime.Whether anyone hears him much going forward is a different story, given names like former BB&T boss John Allison or former FDIC chief Thomas Hoenig being thrown around as possible Fed vice chairmen for bank supervision. Both Allison and Hoenig are fans of following simple leverage ratios, but Tarullo says just focusing on those is "inadequate and dangerous."Tarullo's voice will also have to rise above that of Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum led by Blackstone's Stephen Schwarzman.XLF +1.15%, KRE +1.1%, KBE +1.25%Bank of America (BAC +2.6%), Wells Fargo (WFC +1.4%), JPMorgan (JPM +1.6%), Citigroup (C +2.3%), Goldman Sachs (GS +2.1%), U.S. Bancorp (USB +1%), Regions Financial (RF +1.5%), Synovus (SNV +1.1%), SunTrust (STI +1.4%), Primerica (PRI +2.1%), Bank of New York (BNY +1.4%), State Street (STT +1.1%)

 To finance its $85B deal for Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) -- half of which is coming in cash -- AT&T's (NYSE:T) invited its "relationship banks" to join a $40B bridge loan, at around three ticket levels, Bloomberg reports. Based on ratings of Baa1/BBB+ (and AT&T's ratings are on negative watch at the credit rating firms), the loan pricing may open at L+112.5 basis points, with a 10 bp commitment fee, and upfront fees of 20-30 bps. The company has BofA Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) on board to help finance the deal, though a $30B bond to help fund the deal won't be rushed as doubts remain about whether it will be completed. There's no reason to finance early given that ambiguity, a senior banker says. CreditSight analysts: "The merger may ultimately not be approved ... we feel the odds are around 50/50 at this stage." Some three-quarters of the financing is expected to take place in the investment-grade market. And doing the deal now rather than waiting for more regulatory certainty could end up more expensive for AT&T.

The bank's strong Q3 may have already been discounted by the market, which sent BAC higher by 17% over the past three months. Strong trading results were reported by JPMorgan and Citigroup on Friday, so few were surprised when BofA showed the same this morning (Global Markets net income rose 34% Y/Y).As for deposits and lending, average total deposits rose 6% Y/Y, and average total loans and leases gained 3%. Net interest income edged higher, with net interest yield up 4 basis points from a year ago and flat from last quarter at 2.23%. The banks says a 100 basis point parallel shift in interest rates would benefit NII by $5.3B over the next 12 months - no small amount given $10.2B of NII in Q3, and overall Q3 income of $5B.See earnings call presentation slidesWhile credit loss provisions rose from year-ago levels, they were off nicely from Q1 and Q2.Noninterest expense fell to $13.5B in Q3 from $13.9B a year ago, with personnel costs down 2% and non-personnel costs off 5%.

Customers of offerings like JPMorgan's (NYSE:JPM) Sapphire Reserve card can't believe their good fortune, but bank shareholders can't be faulted for wondering whether there's going to be any profits from the growing rewards war."You have five or six big national players and they are going around killing one another," says Oppenheimer's Chris Kotowski.It's the banking version of a loss leader. The upfront rewards are well above the annual fee, but if customers hold onto the card after the first year, and better yet hold a balance, they could become profitable."It has been a huge success," says the bank's card boss, Kevin Watters. Speaking on Friday's earnings call, CFO Marianne Lake declined to say how much card debt customers need to take on before a profit can be turned.Citigroup's (NYSE:C) spending on cards has also been aggressive, but personal finance gurus say its Prestige premium card needs to up its rewards game to compete with JPMorgan's offering.Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) also naturally want to boost card business, but until now have mostly refrained from joining the war, and earlier this month, American Express (NYSE:AXP) boosted rewards on its Platinum card, though saying publicly the move wasn't in response to JPMorgan and Citi.

Sep. 26, 2016, 9:13 AM|Sep. 23, 2016, 3:20 PM|Accounting change at BofA should smooth impact of rate swings


The change has to do with how Bank of America (BAC -0.5%) accounts for some MBS it owns, and brings its accounting inline with many of its peers.
The bank's previous method boosted reported net interest income in times of rising rates, but cut it when rates fell. The new method will smooth that.
In Q2, for instance, writes the WSJ's Michael Rapoport, BofA said pretax earnings were reduced by $974M thanks to "market-related adjustments" as long rates fell. A year earlier, those adjustments added $669M because rates rose.
Under the new rules, those costs will be accounted for over the lives of the securities (the way most banks already do it) and the "market-related adjustments" line will go away.

With extra ammunition given to the "break up the banks crowd," this is no longer a negligible risk.
Wells Fargo has enjoyed special status compared to the other mega banks since the financial crisis, says Seiberg, but "life [is] about to get worse" for Warren Buffett's favorite. The bank, says Seiberg, will no longer get the benefit of the doubt. "[The] fall from golden child to problem child can be difficult and expensive."
The Senate Banking Committee is set to hold a hearing on the Wells Fargo matter on Sept. 20.

While "cross-selling" is something most lenders try to do, Wells Fargo has built its brand around this theme more than its peers. The charges, says Bove, reopens the question about whether customers can trust their banks and to whether another wave of regulation is needed.
Compass Point's Isaac Boltansky says the news is "bigger than WFC" and should be viewed as "clear, undeniable warnings" to the entire industry on cross-selling. The bit firmly between its teeth now, look for more enforcement actions from the CFPB.

Back to valuation: Bank of America trades at a 12% discount to JPMorgan based on 2017 estimates. The discount seems warranted given JPM's historically better execution and more stable earnings. If BofA can deliver on its cost-cutting targets, says O'Connor, there's potential for this discount to narrow.

Having covered bank stocks on and off since 1985, the team at Oppenheimer says portfolio managers have never been fans of the sector, but the hatred today is off the charts - even as the reasons for that hatred have gone away.
Banks used to be opaque, they overpaid for acquisitions, and often had frothy growth that almost invariably backfired. It's hard to say that today. While banks will always be somewhat opaque, today they're returning capital rather than blowing it on acquisitions, and their "growth initiatives are the epitome of financial probity."
Oppenheimer's six large bank composite has on average churned out quarterly pretax earnings of $31.4B per quarter since 2013 (including $30.5B in Q1 this year, and $33.4B in Q2). That's a lot of money, especially since most of it is being used to buy back stock at less than 10x earnings and below tangible book value.
While lower-for-longer interest rates will continue to hamper earnings, banks are managing appropriately for the current environment, and the math of buying back stock below book will eventually win the day.
Favorite picks are Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).

With interest rates continuing to pressure revenues, banks - after years of slashing costs - are coming under renewed pressure to trim even more expenses. But what's left?
Source: Dan Freed and Olivia Oran at Reuters

The digital revolution has raised hopes for leaner operations, but Bank of America (BAC +0.7%) still spends $1B per year shuffling papers and transporting money in armored trucks. Other costs like mailing paper account statements, replacing lost credit cards, and repairing ATMs haven't gone anywhere either.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) - which for years has bragged about technology allowing customers to bank with their smartphones - had to start hiring tellers again due to customer complaints (it's also hiking pay).
Count Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C) to the above two names as those reporting year-over-year profit declines thanks to the top-line challenges posed by low rates. On the conference call, management faced continued grilling about operating expenses. For its part, Bank of America promised another $3.3B in annual expense cuts.

The Republican convention has left Wall Street banks on edge by embracing a proposal to reinstate Glass-Steagall, the banking separation rule which was dropped during the Clinton administration after a bipartisan effort to overturn it.
The repeal is often cited as a cause of the financial crisis in 2008, even though two of the institutions at the core of the crisis, Lehman and Bear Stearns, were unaffected by the act's prohibition of combining investment and commercial banks.

Citi's Keith Horowitz notes 3% revenue growth in Q2 represents the best quarter for that metric since Q4 of 2012. Core expenses fell on a year-over-year basis for the 17th consecutive quarter.
While it was a "noisy" quarter, Nomura's Steven Chubak notes fee income and the efficiency ratio were positive surprises, while core net interest income and credit costs were inline. This quarter's resetting of interest rate expectations (lower for longer) and curve flattening could put a damper on any positive EPS estimates for H2 and 2017, but Chubak suspects the stock price at 82% of tangible book value has already discounted this.
Speaking on the earnings call, CEO Brian Moynihan says Bank of America (BAC +1.9%) doesn't need higher interest rates to grow earnings. Expense cuts and plans to grow fee income can do the job for now.

While nearly all major U.S. banks cruised through the stress tests last month, writes David Schawel, those exams are about determining if lenders have enough capital to get through a crisis, not whether they can earn the sort of risk-adjusted returns of the past.
On this front (for insurers as well as banks), there's plenty more for investors to worry about, he says, thanks to the vanishing spread between short rates (what the companies pay on their liabilities), and long rates (what they earn on their assets).
A new Fed study finds the adverse effect of weaker net interest margins is materially larger when rates are low. The reason: The lower bound of funding costs is zero as institutions are reticent to charge negative rates.
Investors interested in buying banks or insurers because of seemingly cheap valuations might want to look again. Bank multiples, says Schawel, typically move alongside ROE, and serious improvement in ROE is unlikely with rates remaining low.

The percentage of Americans with subprime credit scores fell to 20.7% in April, the sixth consecutive year-over-year decline, and the lowest level since at least 2005 when FICO started tracking the data.
The level peaked at 25.5% in 2010.
The improving trend means revenue-squeezed banks can boost lending without lowering standards. "It will have a positive impact on loan volume, loan growth and revenue,” says Morgan Whitacre, a consumer client underwriting executive at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
Alongside rising credit scores are near-record lows for defaults. Just 0.81% of consumer loan dollars - including mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards - were in default in May, the lowest level on records going back to 2004. This peaked at 5.51% in 2009.
The result: Consumers are starting to borrow more again ... a good thing until it isn't anymore. Jamie Dimon (NYSE:JPM) earlier in June called the auto-lending market "a little stretched," and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) just lifted its forecast for credit losses in the coming year.

According to the report, the cuts are mostly to come from attrition rather than outright layoffs.The bank has already cut nearly 40K jobs from its consumer division since 2009, bringing headcount down to about 68.4K at the end of Q1. Speaking at a conference this week, Thong Nguyen, head of retail banking, told an audience to expect that number to get to the low 60s.

Not very excited about the prospects for bank stocks given the significant flattening in the yield curve as potentially signaling a deteriorating H2 and 2017 environment, a bank stock analyst nevertheless needs to recommend bank stocks.
Given low expectations as reflected in its cheap valuation, its highly asset-sensitive balance sheet, and the chance for good news from CCAR, Bank of America (BAC -1.3%) is the team's top bank idea.
Looking at regionals, they like the M&A optionality in Comerica (CMA -1.1%), but don't see much value in names like Citizens Financial Group (CFG -1.1%), Regions Financial (RF -1.1%), SunTrust (STI -0.9%), and Zions Bancorp (ZION -0.9%).

Noting a severely adverse scenario even more rigorous than in the past, Morningstar's Dan Werner says it will be hard to read anything negative into a bank's passing the test.
Barclay's Jason Goldberg points out Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) as two poised to thrive if the government were to allow them to draw down capital, but "when" is the big question as next year's tests are expected to be even harder. The two are trading at about 1x book and sport ROEs of roughly 10% - both gauges were about twice those amounts prior to the financial crisis.
JPMorgan's Kian Abouhossein expects Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and SunTrust (NYSE:STI) to have outsized increases in capital return this year, driven mostly by buybacks.
One wild card: This year's tests requires banks to model for negative interest rates.

"It's a machine, no doubt about it," says one getting disgruntled customer of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), which is one of only two U.S. companies which have produced at least $5B of net income in each of the last 14 quarters (Apple is the other).
Worrying analysts though is that customers like the one above - his family has nine Wells products - appear to have had their fill, writes Ben McLannahan in the FT. Wells' lauded cross-sell ratio has fallen from an average of 6.36 products per household in Dec. 2013 to 6.29 a the end of last year."
While the bank trades at a premium to U.S. peers in terms of multiple of net assets, that premium has shrunk to half the level of two years ago, and Wells recently cut some financial targets.
Without a big rise in interest rates, says Standard Life's Chris Haimendorf, "it is very difficult to see how things can get even better from here."
CEO John Stumpf - though acknowledging the low-rate issue - says there are plenty of avenues for growth. He notes peers like BofA (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C) closing branches or even pulling out of certain cities. Wells, on the other hand, is keeping its footprint, but adjusting its format with smaller "bodega branches."
Stumpf: “All of our new account acquisition happens at one of our branches. If you shut that down, at least today, you shut down your front engine."

In separate public comments today, Fed governors Daniel Tarullo and Jerome Powell said the Fed will require the eight largest U.S. banks to hold even more capital if they want to pass stress tests.
The goal, says Powell, is to make capital requirements so difficult that the largest lenders have to honestly assess whether it would be a better idea to break themselves up.
For now, the Fed is going to make 2015's capital surcharges permanent, which alone makes things tougher. "Really quite significant, probably the most significant additional potential capital requirement on the horizon." says former OCC Director John Dugan.
The eight: Bank of America (BAC -0.1%), Citigroup (C -0.3%), JPMorgan (JPM -0.4%), Morgan Stanley (MS -0.7%), Wells Fargo (WFC -0.5%), State Street (STT -0.7%), Goldman Sachs (GS -0.7%), BNY Mellon (BK -0.5%)

May 26, 2016, 3:15 PM|May 25, 2016, 10:28 AM|Banks up the risk with block trades


About half of all share sales by public companies this year have been block trades, writes Corrie Driebusch, versus an average of about one-third over the past five years, and just one-fifth over the past decade.
To review, a block trade involves a bank buying a large chunk of stock from a company or its P-E backers at a discount, in the hopes of unloading it piece-by-piece later that day at a markup.
The increase in block trades, of course, comes as business slows at any number of other bank profit centers, particularly fixed-income trading.
For the most part, block deals have mostly proved profitable this year, with an average one-day return of 0.5%, according to Dealogic. The leaders in U.S. block trades this year are Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), with Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C) also notable participants.

There are a number of groups of plaintiffs, including Baltimore, Houston, and San Diego.
For now, the case goes back to lower court for further proceedings. If the suits are successful, the bill to banks could be several billion dollars.
Roughly a dozen financial companies have already settled official charges of rate manipulation, with some pleading guilty to criminal charges.

"The days of negative provisioning are pretty much dead," says D.A. Davidson's Kevin Reevey. "Now, they're going to have to take provisioning expense and build up reserves based on loan growth."
Total bank loan loss reserves were north of $250B in Q1 2010, before falling to about $24B at the end of last year. Amid the energy crash, they edged higher in Q1. Naturally, those lenders with the most exposure to energy posted some of the largest reserve increases in Q1. "It wasn't just the levels that [oil] went to, it was the speed at which prices dropped," says Peter Guilfoile, chief credit officer at one of those banks - Comerica (NYSE:CMA). Colorado-based National Bank Holdings (NYSE:NBHC) posted the largest Q/Q increase in reserves-to-loans, jumping 39 basis points to 1.43%.
Meanwhile, there were plenty of other banks which actually saw declines in that ratio, notably Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB). These and other lenders in that bucket can thank denominator of that ratio growing quickly enough to offset reserve builds.

Sweeping new compensation rules released by six federal agencies last month would free up pay restrictions for the BlackRock's (NYSE:BLK) of the world, while tightening them for banks like JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).

The result is likely an even stronger flow of talent exodus from the big banks and to outfits like BlackRock, Vanguard, Pimco, and Fidelity, to name four.
“They keep making it more difficult to be a big bank,” says a D.C. attorney.
At those lenders with more than $250B in assets, top management would have 60% of their bonuses deferred for four years. Tough, but even tougher are clawback provisions allowing banks to take back money up to seven years after bonuses vest.
Though mammoth in size, the overwhelming majority of assets at BlackRock and the like are client, not proprietary assets. Thus, they aren't subject to the same restrictions. Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN), for instance, has $743B in AUM, but only about $16B of its own assets. Blackstone (NYSE:BX) manages $344B, but only $22B of its own money.

She also accuses the bank of violating Dodd-Frank whistleblower protects by suspending her for complaining about illegal activity.

For Bank of America, it says the risk in its trading portfolio in Q1 was the lowest in any quarter since the Merrill Lynch merger in 2009.

What's the bank doing to get more efficient, asked 9th-grader Natalie Clarke of Bank of America (BAC -0.9%) CEO Brian Moynihan at the annual meeting this week. BofA, of course, has a notoriously high efficiency ratio (like in golf, high isn't good).
Clarke is the owner of 5K shares of Bank of America given to her as a baby, and at previous annual meetings has queried about her father who got laid off and about pay for women. This year she got serious: "You and I are looking at some pretty bad numbers," she told Moynihan. BofA is about flat since Moynihan took over, and sells for just two-thirds of book value. Its 11% decline in 2016 stands against just a 3.5% fall in the KBW Bank Index, and is worse than its big bank peers.
As for Clarke's holdings, she got her shares in 2002 when BofA was a $34 stock, more than double today's price.
“There’s a perception that you guys shine your shoes, go to work and wait for interest rates to rise,” said the considerably older Mike Mayo at the meeting. Mayo later said Clarke's questions did a good job of summarizing the concerns of bank investors.

Among the speakers was analyst Mike Mayo, who criticized the board's independent members for not holding CEO Brian Moynihan and team more accountable for hitting financial targets. He called the compensation proposal "extra pay for management."
Mayo upgraded BofA to Outperform about three months ago, arguing the cheap valuation and strong balance sheet made the stock a buy despite poor corporate governance.

Having had some time to digest weak, but better-than-hoped Q1 results for the nation's largest lenders, Goldman analyst Richard Ramsden remains bullish on the likes of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).
He notes NIMs expanded - meaning banks held onto most of the benefit from the Fed's December rate hike. Cost-cutting programs are beginning to bear fruit, with 9% Y/Y cuts in compensation costs, and 3% declines in non-comp expenses.
As for energy, provisions made for a 9% drag on EPS, but reserves now stand at 6% of funded energy loans, or 11% of E&P oilfield service loans.
Ramsden is looking for robust loan and deposit growth for the rest of this year.
His favorite name is Bank of America with a $17 price target (vs. current $14.39). The stock trades at 10.5x 2016 earnings, but probably has the most sensitivity to higher rates, and the most core and non-core expense leverage.
 

Apr. 19, 2016, 1:29 PM|Apr. 14, 2016, 10:32 AM|BofA turns higher following earnings and call


Living will: The fixes are "completely doable," says CFO Paul Donofrio, addressing yesterday's rejection of his bank's wind-down plan.
Return on assets: ROA slipped to 0.5% in Q1 from 0.6% a quarter earlier - just half of CEO Brian Moynihan's goal of 1%. Moynihan tells callers interest rates will have to rise before that level can be reached.
Mobile still growing fast: The bank in Q1 had 19.6M active users of its mobile banking services, up 15% from a year ago. 16% of deposits are now done through mobile devices. On branch cuts, management says they are consolidating into larger branches, and the new ones look more like a sales office than a traditional branch. Donofrio: “I think the branches are not going to be places where people come to transact. They’re going to come for a product they need because something changed in their life."
Expenses: The efficiency ratio improved, but it's still a whopping 75% vs. peers in the mid-to-high 50s. Moynihan wants to at least get it down to the low-60s. Pressed on expenses by Mike Mayo, Donofrio says the bank is splitting cost savings between future growth and the bottom line. "It's a lever we can pull over an extended period of time."

JPMorgan's revenues and profits both fell from a year ago, but the lame performance of the banks thus far this year has already priced in a weak quarter. JPMorgan is higher by 3.8%, with Citigroup (C +4.7%), Bank of America (BAC +3.5%), Wells Fargo (WFC +1.7%), Goldman Sachs (GS +2.9%), and Morgan Stanley (MS +4.4%) joining the party. The XLF is higher by 1.75% vs. the S&P 500's 0.7% advance.
But what about all of these players (except for Citi) having their living wills rejected by the Fed, FDIC, or both? A sideshow, no doubt. Regulators are going to regulate - like the commercial goes, "It's what they do." Banks will tweak plans, numbers, or whatever they need to in order to get D.C. to eventually sign off.

Official announcement
Regulators were split on Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), with the FDIC giving Goldman a thumbs down, but the Fed not, and just the opposite for Morgan.
Citigroup (NYSE:C) is the only one of the major banks not to have their plan rejected, though both the Fed and FDIC found "shortcomings" that need to be addressed by July 2017.

At least half of the eight U.S. banks labeled "systemically important" are expected to receive "harsh verdicts" regarding their so-called living wills, sending them scrambling to revise plans about how they would handle a potential bankruptcy, WSJ reports.
The move, which could come as soon as this week, would raise the prospect of higher capital requirements or other regulatory sanctions for some of the institutions, and underscore fears that the firms remain "too big to fail" without a taxpayer bailout.

“Let’s not sugarcoat it, this is not necessarily a loan a bank wants to make at this point,” says Evercore ISI's Glenn Schorr, talking about loans banks have committed to for energy companies, but upon which those firms have not yet drawn.In Q1, energy borrowers announced draws of more than $3B on these loans, saddling banks with maybe more exposure to the sector than they or their investors would like right now.Citigroup (NYSE:C), for example, has about $20B in funded energy loan exposure, but commitments for nearly another $40B. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has loans of just over $20B and commitments for another $20B-plus. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), SunTrust (NYSE:STI), Comerica (NYSE:CMA), Regions Financial (NYSE:RF), and KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) are showing similar stories (though mostly smaller amounts).

Focusing on "too big to fail" is too narrow a lens with which to analyze and make decisions about bank size and concentration, says the team at KBW, taking note of increased chatter of late about a forced breakup of the nation's largest lenders.
Returns are part of the mix too, and if they're poor at the mega-banks, this limits credit creation in the economy - a signal, says KBW, that companies must "radically restructure" to get their stock prices above at least tangible book value.
Looking at the stock prices of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C) during the past five years, KBW says Wells has traded above TBV throughout the time period - suggesting the bank is consistently creating returns above its cost of capital.

The 10-year Treasury yield at 1.69% has returned back to levels not seen since the panicky action in mid-February. And while the Fed has marked down its expectation of rate hikes this year to just two, short-term interest rate markets haven't even priced in one.
This leaves those whose business model depends on riding the yield curve having to contend with not only a middling macro picture, but - once again - a rates lower for longer picture (although Jamie Dimon says his big fear is that markets aren't pricing in nearly enough in the way of higher rates).

"We are confident in the capital strength of the large and mid-cap banks - and with that, their capacity for increased capital returns," says Credit Suisse's Susan Roth Katzke.
Stronger balance sheets, she says, should outweigh what is a harsher adverse scenario from the Fed.
Roth and team see a total net capital return increase of 77% vs. 58% in 2015, with a median payout ratio of 31% vs. 27%. Incremental dollars should be skewed to buybacks given cheap stock valuations and the Fed's preference for the flexibility afforded by repurchases.
Best positioned for the highest capital return are Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Regions Financial (NYSE:RF), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB), PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC), and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB).
The highest incremental capital returns should come from Zions Bancorp (NASDAQ:ZION), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and M&T Bank (NYSE:MTB).
The lower end of payout ratios should fall on Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN) and Bank of America.

The Department of Labor this week is expected to release final regulations requiring brokers to act with a fiduciary standard - that is act solely in the best interest of their client. Previously, recommendations only had to be "suitable" for clients - a less rigorous standard allowing excessive fees, and investments with hidden commissions.
Investors now paying trading commissions will likely be moved into accounts where brokers collect fees based on AUM. Popular, but costly products like variable annuities, commodity pools and non-tradable REITs might no longer find a home in retirement accounts. They'll be replaced with low-cost index funds.
Whether it all works out for the little guy remains to be seen, but one thing is sure: Regulatory costs will be on the rise, something larger shops - think Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) - are going to be able to absorb better than smaller players who are more reliant on commissions - think LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) and Raymond James (NYSE:RF).
Big providers of index mutual funds and ETFs are winners as well - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW), and WisdomTree (NASDAQ:WETF) fit the bill. Active mutual fund houses like Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN), Legg Mason (NYSE:LM), and Waddell & Reed (NYSE:WDR), not so much.
Insurers who are big providers are variable annuities could also be pressured - Ameriprise (NYSE:AMP), Lincoln National (NYSE:LNC), MetLife (NYSE:MET), Prudential (NYSE:PRU).

Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) leads the league in fumbling stress-test submissions - three in last five years - but this year, the lender is tasking its own Winston Wolfe with tackling the job.
“She’s pretty much fearless," says former Ken Lewis executive Steele Alphin of Chief Administrative Officer Andrea Smith. "I asked her to do things that were very, very difficult to do."
Regulators have told the bank of their concern with excessive turnover in recent years of those running the test, and that the bank needs to stop viewing the CCAR as a once-a-year exercise, rather than part of a bigger-picture capital management effort. Part of Smith's job, writes Christina Rexrode, is to alleviate those concerns.
Her job leading this task is of particular interest given her human resources background. Executives at other lenders running the test typically come out of finance or risk.
"It’s kind of like an orchestra leader,” says COO Thomas Montag. "I have no idea if the orchestra leader can play any of the instruments, but if you don’t have somebody at the front providing the timing and the direction and the focus, it sounds kind of lousy.”

Return on average common equity (ROACE) is what determines the valuation of large, mature banks, says RBC's Gerard Cassidy, and those banks that cannot earn their cost of equity capital - estimated at 9-10% through the cycle - ought to consider alternative strategies, including breaking up.
The key here is interest rates, and should they remain at these levels for a prolonged period, reaching targeted ROACE will be difficult for all banks, particularly for Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C).
While a sum-of-the-parts analysis indicates value could be unlocked, the cost of doing so could be prohibitive, says Cassidy.
Long-term investors planning on holding through the cycle are better off with Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), but active investors managing their portfolios more aggressively might consider BofA and Citi.

"Our overall Q1 results reflect an exceptionally volatile and turbulent market environment during our first fiscal quarter," says Jefferies (NYSE:LUK) CEO Richard Handler. "A quiet December was followed by an extremely challenging January and first few weeks of February."
The investment bank posted a loss of $166.8M in Q1 vs. a profit of $12.9M a year ago. Revenue of $299M fell a full 49%, led by an 82% plunge in trading revenue to $58.8M. Of this, fixed-income revenue fell to $56.8M from $126M. Equity trading revenue fell to just $1.7M from $203.5M thanks to markdowns on two equity block trades.
Good times ahead: Not only have markets stabilized, says management, they've "aggressively snapped back" in the early part of Q2.
Coming one month ahead of the rest of the Wall Street banks, Jefferies results are often seen as a bellwether of what to expect.

While the big Wall Street banks are struggling with slides in fixed-income revenues, business is booming at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and other ETF providers offering credit-related products.
The banks, writes Lisa Abramowicz, want some of that business back.
The issue for banks are new regulatory and capital rules which make it harder to hold big inventories are paper investors want to trade. Meanwhile, the ease of moving in and out of vehicles like BlackRock's $25B IG bond fund (NYSEARCA:LQD) or its $16B junk-bond fund (NYSEARCA:HYG) have led to surging volumes, even as the individual securities underlying those ETFs are more difficult to trade.
Banks are responding with the total-return swap in which an investor pays a fee to a counterparty who promises delivery of the total gain on a basket of certain debt. These instruments are not only quickly traded without having to deal with the underlying securities, but are pegged to some of the same indexes as the biggest credit ETFs. Citigroup (NYSE:C) just became the eight dealer in these derivatives (joining GS, BAC, JPM, MS, CS, DB and OTCQX:BNPQY), which are being pitched by banks as an alternative to ETFs.

The global economy has been powered by credit for more than 40 years, says Bill Gross - noting official credit outstanding today of $58T is 58x that of 1970. That expansion, though, looks to be ending, as private sector savers are growing leery, and regulators build fences against fast creation. And don't forget the meager returns, with negative interest rates in 40% of Euroland, and out ten years on the curve in Japan.
The collapse in bank stocks globally isn't necessarily about energy losses. Price charts since 2007 for players like Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS), Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) suggest the sector's either a screaming cheap buy, or "a permanently damaged victim of writes-offs, tighter regulation, and significantly lower futures margins. I'll vote for the latter."
Then there's insurers, whose business models - which depend on 7-8% returns from risk assets - are at risk. They're not going bankrupt, but future profitability for companies like MetLife (NYSE:MET), Prudential (NYSE:PRU), and Hartford (NYSE:HIG) will be stifled as claims can't be covered as easily when investment returns are so lame.
The same goes or pension funds, and Puerto Rico is going down Detroit's path not just because of overpromised benefits, but because they're not earning enough on their investment portfolios to cover those promises.
Central bankers, meanwhile, think they can solve things by cutting rates just a bit further.

Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) last May tapped two mortgage executives to lead the auto loan business, writes Dan Freed, and they have hired loan officers and salespeople at a fast clip since.
The timing could be deemed as curious, with regulators and competitors sending signals that the benign credit cycle of the past years has peaked.
Across the industry, banks classified $1.1B of auto loans as uncollectible in Q4. That's up 15% from a year earlier, and 39% from 2011 (though the size of the market has grown considerably since 2011).
"I'm not actively hiring or growing our operations across the platform. That's for sure," says Andrew Stuart, who heads TD Auto Finance.
Earlier this month, Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank said auto loans after the financial crisis provided "once in a lifetime type returns," but now the business has begun to lose strength.
For its part, BofA says its focused strictly on prime and "superprime" customers, and the vast majority of borrowers have credit scores above 700.

In another sign of the difficulties lower-rated credits are having with borrowing, Goldman Sachs (GS +2.1%) is having a hard time moving $2B in paper backing the buyout of Solera Holdings, reports the WSJ.
Solera late last year agreed to an LBO to Vista Equity Partners for $6.5B, including debt.
The bonds backing the sale carry an especially weak Caa1 rating from Moody's, and it's in these lower-rated tranches where the worst of the high-yield carnage has taken place. Demand "is really nonexistent now," says one portfolio manager.
Goldman had hoped to unload the Solera bonds at a price to yield about 10%, but by midday yesterday had only found buyers for about half of the paper, and pricing had moved above 11%.
As painful as it is for borrowers, it's also so for the banks which earn big fees from lending commitments - great when the bonds are easy to move, but a profit eater when the stuff has so sit on the books for very long. Goldman, in particular, has sought to boost market share in this part of the business against traditional powerhouses like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).

It's another nasty session for banks today, writes David Reilly, and the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index is now lower by almost 20% YTD, with names like Citigroup (C -2.3%) and Bank of America (BAC -2.3%) down nearly 30%.
The nasty feedback cycle begins with the crash in the oil price, which stings banks thanks to worries of big losses on energy-lending, and more broadly hurts lenders by dragging down the stocks in general. This in turn, leads to concern about a recession would further ding bank profits.
More ominous, the yield curve is flattening. Using the spread between two-year and 10-year Treasury notes isn't a bad proxy for bank profits and it's slumped to just 0.96% today. Old-timers will remember when this spread used to turn negative - a sure sign of looming recession.
The good news, says Reilly, is that the energy crash and low rates don't look to cause the sorts of losses seen in 2008. Take the long view - the cycle will someday turn.

Holding its investor day today, JPMorgan said it was going to add another $500M to energy-related loan-loss reserves. This followed a $67M provision in Q4, which at the time brought total oil and gas loss reserves to $815M (vs. a portfolio with book value of $44B).
In addition, the bank said it could need to add another $1.5B to reserves should oil hang around $25 per barrel over the next 18 months. For perspective, prior to Q4, JPMorgan hadn't had to add to reserves for six years - in fact reserve releases were a big boost to profits across the industry.
"When the biggest bank increases reserves for potential oil losses it sets a tone for the industry,” says Mike Mayo.
Separately, the FDIC says bad loan provisions across the banking sector were $3.8B higher in Q4 than a year earlier.

Just at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), employees have taken $400M in paper losses on their restricted stock paid out as bonus last year, according to the WSJ.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), BofA (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) haven't yet reported 2015 stock grants, but their share prices have been similarly hit.
Should slumping stock prices persist, it could add to the leakage of talent from Wall Street to tech and other industries, as bankers will be leaving a lot less money on the table.
The issue is a test for new Dodd-Frank rules which forced banks to tailor incentive packages towards rewarding long-term health, rather than short-term profits. The result: Banks are now more likely to award restricted shares which don't vest for several years.

Former Goldmanite and TARP czar, and now Minneapolis Fed President, Neil Kashkari says the time is right for Congress to go further than Dodd-Frank "with bold, transformational solutions to solve [too big to fail] once and for all."
Lawmakers, he says, should break up the largest banks into "smaller, less connected, less important entities." Other options would be turning the large lenders into public utilities by forcing them to hold so much capital that they can't fail, or taxing leverage throughout the financial system.

 It is the European banks and contagion concerns that are freaking out the markets today - not just the Fed, China and crude oil - according to David Rosenberg, noting that some of the European banks are trading at 2008 crisis levels after the group has tumbled 18% YTD vs. 11% for the STOXX 600 index. European financial firms are taking a beating amid fears of "a chronic profitability crisis that makes it impossible for banks to build up barely-adequate capital bases," WSJ reports.
Deutsche Bank (DB -9.8%) is down another ~10%, bringing its YTD loss to nearly 40% while its valuation has fallen to ~30% of book value, and its credit default swaps spiked to their highest levels since 2012. News of major withdrawals out of Credit Suisse (CS -4.2%) caused its shares to sink 11% last week, hitting a 24-year low, and Santander (SAN -6.2%), BBVA (BBVA -5.4%), and UniCredit (OTCPK:UNCFF -5.5%) are down to lows seen during the last eurozone financial crisis. "Oil and the flatter yield curve alone do not explain the 12% plunge we have seen in S&P Financials so far this year," Rosenberg says, adding that BofA (BAC -6.1%), Citigroup (C -6.2%) and Wells Fargo (WFC -3.5%) all briefly touched 52-week lows last week - "an ominous signpost."

Feb. 8, 2016, 2:24 PM|Feb. 3, 2016, 1:00 PM|Heard on the Street: BofA too cheap


Bank of America (BAC -3.7%) has been especially punished in this year's selloff, losing 24% of its value vs. about a 13% drop in the XLF. Even though a rising rate scenario once again appears to be off the table, writes David Reilly, the stock trading at less than 60% of book value has priced in too dire of an outcome.
On last week's earnings call, the bank said it could lose $700M over the next nine quarters if oil stays at $30 per barrel, and Bernstein's John McDonald estimates losses in a stressed scenario in excess of current reserves of $1.2B - equal to just 0.5% of tangible common equity, or roughly 5% of what the bank should earn this year.
As for rates, even with a 10-year yield of just 1.75% one year ago, the bank had a NIM of 2.17% - it can still make money.
With weak returns and a need for even more aggressive cost-cutting, BofA probably deserves to sell at a discount to book value, acknowledges Reilly, but 40% is just too much.
A catalyst? Should the valuation remain this low much longer, activists are likely to boost the pressure on CEO Brian Moynihan, including calling for a potentially value-creating breakup.

Barron’s says it’s a good time to bet on the big banks after a rocky start to the year.
The 10 biggest U.S. banks are trading for 8x-12x 2016 estimated earnings; the S&P 500 trades at 16x.
Exposure to distressed U.S. energy companies is manageable.
While leading Democratic presidential candidates are pushing for a breakup of the biggest banks, that possible eventuality could be a positive since many trade below their sum-of-parts.
The following banks all have 20% upside: Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), BB&T (NYSE:BBT), PNC (NYSE:PNC), Suntrust (NYSE:STI), U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB).Barron’s also mentions Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG) and Region’s Financial (NYSE:RF) favorably.

The stock trades at a 20% discount to year-end estimated tangible book value of $17 per share, says CLSA's Mike Mayo. That's worse than the recessions in the early 1990s and early 2000s, despite better balance sheet strength today.
Further, the bank could grow book value even if the U.S. goes into recession.
There's also the chance BofA (BAC +1.1%) could become an "event-driven" stock, says Mayo. First, the 67% efficiency ratio is worst among the large U.S. banks, so there's plenty of room for improvement. Second, a sum-of-the parts analysis yields a result 40% higher than the current market cap. Third, shareholders are starting to speak up - while an activist is an outside shot, increased owner pressure seems likely.
He upgrades from Sell to Outperform, with price target of $16 up from (suggesting upside of less than 20%).

Jan. 27, 2016, 2:33 PM|Jan. 21, 2016, 3:15 PM|Nasty post-earnings price action in BofA


The stock has given up another 2.6% today, even as the broader market rallies and its TBTF peers are just modestly lower. Shares are lower by 20% YTD, and 13.4% Y/Y.
Holding court at Davos, CEO Brian Moynihan says the job cuts will continue this year after more than 10K reductions in 2015. Total headcount at the bank is 213.3K. The efficiency ratio at BofA for 2015 of 68.6% is far worse than competitors like Citigroup (57%) and Wells Fargo (57.8%)
Cost cuts are nice, but revenue growth can also help that ratio. Expect that to remain challenging, however, even as the U.S. economy improves, says CFO Paul Donofrio.

Expenses at Bank of America remain "way too high," says Oppenheimer's Chris Kotowski. "We are are still more struck by how far Bank of America (BAC -1.5%) still has to go to generate a competitive level of profitability.” The bank's efficiency ratio improved to 70.2% in Q4 from 74.9% a year ago. ROTCE of 7.3% rose from 7.1%.
Addressing the oil crash, new CFO Paul Donofrio says it's more supply than demand, He knows this, he says, because if demand for energy was dropping, it would show up in the asset quality of the bank's non-energy-related loans, and this isn't happening. Donofrio says energy makes up just 2% of the bank's loan portfolio.
As for consumer benefits, CEO Brian Moynihan says spending on credit and debit cards rose 4% Y/Y, but without the oil decline, it would have risen 5.7%. Putting a dollar number on it, that's $20M per day in savings to the bank's credit and debit card customers.

Three picks from the team: Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) at 1.1x tangible book value vs. peers at 1.35x. The $18 price target assumes just 1.05x book given weaker returns on capital and revenue growth visibility. BB&T (NYSE:BBT) trades at 11.5x 2016 estimated EPS - inline with peers, but BB&T's solid pre-provision returns, competitive positioning, and better relative capital deployment opportunities warrant a premium valuation.

Key to the issues are the computer models the central bank uses to simulate how banks might perform during a recession. The results spewed out by these programs effectively determine the level of dividends and buybacks of the nation's large banks (not to mention the career path of bank managers).
Source: WSJ

Internal reviews found shortcomings in the Fed's system for double-checking the models - too few staff, too heavy reliance on certain key personnel, and lacking clear procedures and policies about certain aspects of the validation process. “Similar findings identified at institutions supervised by the Federal Reserve have typically been characterized as matters requiring immediate attention," according to the report.
In response, the Fed has done what most bureaucracies do - hired more staff and created a supervisory committee. Nevertheless, the findings of the reviews are likely to add fuel to calls from bankers and lawmakers for the central bank to open up the "black box" of its stress-testing models.
Among the interested parties are Citigroup (NYSE:C), which failed a stress test, and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) - all of whom have had their issues.

The major averages are lower following the blowout jobs number, but the financial sector (XLF +1%) is charging ahead, enthused at what appears to finally be the near-certain prospect of higher interest rates.
Short-term interest rate futures are pricing in about a 75% chance of a rate hike next month, and the 10-year Treasury yield is up nine basis points to 2.32%. The two-year yield has soared all the way to 0.90% - its highest level in more than five years.
The green in this yield-starved sector is everywhere: Bank of America (BAC +3.5%), Citigroup (C +3.4%), U.S. Bancorp (USB +2.8%), Regions Financial (RF +3.7%), PNC Financial (PNC +2.4%), Capital One (COF +1.4%), Bank of New York  Mellon (BK +1.9%), E*Trade (ETFC +3.5%), Schwab (SCHW +5.1%), Interactive Brokers (IBKR +3.4%), MetLife (MET +3.2%), Prudential (PRU +3.6%).

"This transaction is consistent with Bank of America’s (NYSE:BAC) ongoing efforts to simplify its business, in this instance, by outsourcing certain product manufacturing functions to an industry leader," says a bank spokesperson following  yesterday's deal to sell its $87B AUM money-market business to BlackRock (NYSE:BLK).
While ZIRP has crimped the profitability of money-market funds, the deal could wind up being a sweet one for BlackRock should rates rise, and the boosted size (AUM will rise to $372B from $285B) should bring needed efficiencies if rates don't move. "It's a challenge managing cash in a low interest-rate environment, so we have to be highly efficient," says Tom Callahan, co-head of global cash management. BlackRock will leapfrog JPMorgan to become the #2 money market fund family after the deal closes next year (Fidelity is #1).
Terms were not disclosed.

 Bank of America (BAC -1.8%) has come to a $335M settlement of a lengthy federal suit where it was accused of misleading shareholders about mortgage-backed security exposure, and about its dependence on MERS, the national mortgage electronic registry. In its 10-Q filing, the bank said the $335M was fully accrued as of June 30, though the deal still needs final court approval. The suit was led by the Pennsylvania Public School Employees Retirement System, which said shareholders were misled into buying BAC stock in 2009 and 2010. It was allowed to go forward by a federal judge in July 2012. Shareholders had claimed the bank knew it couldn't raise enough capital if it revealed it had to buy back billions of dollars in securities, and that it knew MERS was so shoddy that it wouldn't be able to legally foreclose on thousands of delinquent mortgages.

With Carl Icahn's targeting of AIG, activists are clearly climbing higher on the financial-services food chain, writes David Reilly. The goal is to make the companies small enough to not be subject to the sorts of stringent D.C. regulations associated with being too-big-to-fail.
A case in point is CIT Group, which last week announced the departure of John Thain and a plan to sell certain units. Thain's goal had been just the opposite - to turn CIT into a TBTF.
The biggest of the big won't be quaking in their boots, says Reilly, noting the typical tools of the activist - boosting capital returns or levering up - would be dead on arrival in Washington. As much as investors would like to see Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) broken up in order to realize value - they haven't traded above book value in seven years - it's not going to happen this way.

A badly-burned Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) won't do it anymore, but JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) - aiming to make up for slowing business in its mortgage operation - is increasingly buying loans from smaller lenders, writes Dan Freed for Reuters.In H1, the Bank of Dimon bought 62% of the $58B in residential mortgages added to its books, up from 56% in 2014 and 37% in 2011. According to Inside Mortgage Finance, JPMorgan has shown the biggest increase among peers in so-called correspondent lending."As they gain more confidence about the environment, they go right back to the correspondent channel for more volume," says analyst Charles Peabody. "There's more risk in being that far away from the customer," says BofA's Steve Boland, who leads mortgage and auto lending. For its part, JPMorgan  says it only works with "experienced, well-managed, and high quality lenders," and reviews every loan in detail.Wells Fargo's (NYSE:WFC) Eric Stoddard - who runs the bank's correspondent business - says it's cheaper to buy mortgages from other lenders than to make the loans itself."I think Bank of America's (policy) is a little foolish," says lender Ken Perimutter, whose PERL expects to make about $1.6B in home loans this year, and sell about 60% of those to JPMorgan.

The Street has priced in earnings declines for pretty much every sector, but Q3 and Q4 estimates for the financials have barely budged, and consensus sees Q3 results 10% above that of a year ago.
Morgan Stanley's Huw van Steenis, however, sees FICC revenue declines of 10-25% - far more than the 5% or so that's been talked about by bank managements at recent investor conferences - as the commodity price crash combines with collapsing fixed-income trading, and the lack of volatility in forex action.
With just $20B in FICC revenues, says van Steenis, Q3 is shaping up to be the second worst quarter for banks in the last two years. Leaving his own bank (NYSE:MS) out of the analysis, he sees FICC revenue declines of 17% at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), 9% at Goldman (NYSE:GS), and 6% at BofA (NYSE:BAC) and Citi (NYSE:C).
Bottom line: "On EPS, we are 4% below consensus on average across our coverage for 2015, and 5% below for 2016. The biggest delta is for Barclays (NYSE:BCS), BNP Paribas (OTCQX:BNPQY), and Goldman in 2015, and SocGen (OTCPK:SCGLY), HSBC, and BNP in 2016."

With some questioning if Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) cost-cutting strategy under CEO Brian Moynihan is losing steam, the bank yesterday began laying off roughly 200 employees in its trading and investment-banking units.
In recent years, those units generated up to 40% of bank revenue with less than 10% of the company's staff, but BofA is the only major U.S. bank which posted a decline in trading and investment banking revenue in H1. It's also lost ground in areas targeted for growth like M&A.
"The rules have changed," says COO Thomas Montag, who is in charge of the units. The bank, he says, is no longer going to do business in some products and activities it previously engaged in.
The news is not all bad. Montag's push to get the investment bank to work with the wealth management and the consumer bank (he showed up at one bank function with a hat and t-shirt emblazoned with the words "Cross Sell") appears to be paying some dividends. Referral volume of 4.2M in 2014 gained from 300K in 2010, with a success rate of 20%.

Health care, media, and telecom activity has been robust, and should stay so. Activity in energy should increase, but banking M&A should stay subdued.
The winners? U.S. bulge bracket and boutique firms have gained market share at the expense of European and other non-U.S. companies.

BofA head of strategy and marketing, general counsel Gary Lynch, and lead independent director Jack Bovender have been meeting with big investors both by phone and in New York to make their case. The bank is also paying $150K plus expenses to two outside firms to make phone calls to individual investors.
The bank argues that taking the chairman role from Moynihan at this time - just as earnings are beginning to improve and the bank has seemingly overcome its stress test flubs - would be a distraction and throw BofA back into uncertainty. Those close to the matter say Moynihan hasn't given any indication of whether he would exit the CEO spot should he lose the chairman vote.

Before Bank of America (or any bank) can use this framework, it had to conduct a satisfactory "parallel run" using the framework.

"Do I need higher rates to buy Bank of America (BAC +1.6%)," ask Morgan Stanley's Betsy Graseck and Manan Gosalia. "No," they say, at least not at the current stock price.
Forgetting higher rates, accelerating loan growth coupled with strong fee growth should lift revenues 3-5% Y/Y in 2016-17. Assuming a flat core expense ratio of 60% means another $0.07-$0.21 to EPS, or $2 to the stock price. And expense management - which BofA continues to work hard on - could mean even more upside to earnings.

The country's two largest pension funds - the California Public Employees' Retirement System and the California State Teachers' Retirement System - will vote against a measure allowing CEO Brian Moynihan to retain the chairman spot at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
The two roles have "inherent conflicts" requiring them to remain separate and independent, say the funds in a letter to the bank's lead independent director Jack Bovender. The funds also note continuing underperformance of the stock price since Moynihan took the CEO role in 2010, struggles with the annual stress tests, and "sub-par engagement" with investors. “Given these missteps, we do not believe now is the time to reduce oversight of management by combining the roles of CEO and chair.”
Source: Bloomberg

Continuing his campaign against allowing Moynihan to serve in the two roles, Mike Mayo brings a megaphone onto CNBC. A "yes" vote on Sept. 22 - allowing Moynihan to retain both spots - could put a regulatory target on the industry's back (surely he means another regulatory target).

A rare growth business for Wall Street banks has been loans backed by investment portfolios, but with margin calls being issued this week, profits could take a hit if clients pull back from borrowing.
Morgan Stanley (MS +1.6%) had $25.3B in securities-based loans outstanding as of June 30, up 37% year-over-year. Bank of America (BAC +0.2%) had $38.6B of the loans, up 14.2%. Wells Fargo (WFC +1.1%) had $59.3B, up 16%.
The amounts are small compared to overall bank lending, but change comes at the margin, and the largest brokerage firms have reported higher securities-based loan balances each quarter for more than two years.
Look for profits at bank wealth-management units to decline in coming quarters, says Portales Partners' Charles Peabody, in part thanks to declines in securities lending.

 Fidelity Investments is shopping around for better terms for a very popular and highly rated cash-back credit card, as it considers dropping American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) as its partners, Bloomberg reports. Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) are wooing the No. 2 mutual fund provider, hoping to replace American Express on the Fidelity Investment Rewards American Express card, which routes 2% of purchases into a variety of brokerage, cash-management and savings accounts. A breakup would be the most recent blow to growth for AmEx, which is already splitting with Costco and JetBlue on their partner cards. Global Network Services -- where other banks issue AmEx-branded cards -- is the fastest-growing part of spending on AmEx's network. Co-branded cards now account for about 30% of all transactions.

 "Like the basketball player LeBron James, [JPMorgan Chase] is good at both offense and defense,” CLSA analysts Mike Mayo and Chris Spahr write as they upgrade JPM shares to Buy from Outperform with a $78 price target. For defense, JPMorgan (JPM +4.3%) has "a balance sheet that is the most resilient since it has been in its current form, the most stable earnings of U.S. global banks for the past decade, and a dividend level vs. the 10-year that implies stock outperformance 85% of the time," CLSA says.
For offense, JPM "is a unique self-help story given tailwinds from expense savings" and has "historically gained market share in tougher environments." Banking shares are broadly higher but the upgrade seems to be giving JPM an extra boost; three analyst upgrades appear to be helping Bank of America (BAC +5.2%) in similar fashion.

Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) +6.3% premarket as the stock market is poised for an early rebound from yesterday's losses and BAC shares are upgraded to Outperform from Market Perform with a $19 price target at Bernstein.
The selloff provides a more  attractive entry point to recovering a "franchise with longer term  potential to benefit from higher rates, improved operating leverage, and  expanding capital return," the firm writes.
BAC also is upgraded to Outperform from Neutral at Baird, which says steady growth in tangible book value should drive appreciation for the shares until the interest rate and growth outlook improves, and upgraded to Neutral from Underperform at Macquarie.

 Bank of America (BAC -3.5%) is sharply lower despite getting upgraded to Outperform from Market Perform with a $20 price target at KBW, which believes the hit bank stocks have taken due to the “lower interest rates for longer” sentiment is not all negative, given that there would now be a decline in momentum investors who were buying bank stock merely based on rising rates. The firm says BAC shares have ~26% upside potential, the second highest upside of the 20 large regional/universal banks in its coverage universe, and it raises its annual EPS estimates through to 2017 to $1.48, $1.60 and $1.80 from $1.30, $1.50 and $1.73, respectively.

A shareholder vote set for Sept. 22 will decide whether Brian Moynihan can keep both the CEO and chairman titles at Bank of America (BAC -0.8%), and one week later the bank's resubmission of its capital plan to the Fed is due.
"If they fail this time, I'd call for his head," says Cougar Capital's Buzzy Geduld, an owner of 2.5M shares of the stock. "At the very minimum, you split the CEO and chairman roles."
Moynihan is deeply involved in the resubmission, reports Bloomberg, leading weekly steering meetings on the project. The bank is spending hundreds of millions overhauling data systems, rebuilding databases, and enhancing controls.
One worry: Regulators haven't specified what they want from the bank, leaving the executive team in the dark about exactly what will get a thumbs up.
Scoreboard: BofA is lower by 1.1% YTD versus the 5.5% gain for the 24-company KBW Bank Index. The stock is higher by 17% since Moynihan took over in 2010 versus an 84% gain for the KBW.

Guggenheim's four key investment themes: 1) Names levered to improving M&A, with Goldman being the best idea, followed by Morgan Stanley (MS -1.3%); 2) Restructuring stories, with Zions the best idea, but First Horizon (FHN -1%), Ally Financial (ALLY -1.8%), and BofA (BAC -1.6%) also worth looking at; 3) Idiosyncratic growth stories like MasterCard (MA +0.7%), Visa (V +4.5%), Synchrony Financial (SYF -2.4%), and Signature Bank (SBNY -0.8%); 4) Names with a distinct M&A catalyst in the regionals group like BB&T (BBT -1.5%), CIT Group (CIT -1.6%), and Springleaf (LEAF -1.4%).
Mixed results from credit card companies affirm the team's preference for SYF, but the risk/reward at AmEx (AXP -1.4%) is improving. AmEx, CapOne (COF -13%), and Discover (DFS -2.7%) results show the boosted competition they face form the banks, which is slowing growth, and lifting marketing and rewards costs.

With Q2 results for the nation's largest banks now all in, Dick Bove says the key takeaway is operating earnings - which eliminates taxes, and the impact from loan losses and reserve releases - are not just growing, they're jumping. By his calculation, the operating earnings for BAC, C, JPM, and WFC are up 23% for the last twelve months compared to the previous period.
Asset quality is far better nowadays as well, he says, noting the new regulatory regime has forced lenders to hold a higher amount of government-guaranteed paper on their books. "The addition of capital, cash, and government-backed securities means that the book value of these companies is very real. Yet, at least two of the big banks sell at a discount to this value."
More bullish points: The most onerous and costly of the new regulations are already out there, litigation - while continuing - won't be nearly as expensive going forward, M&A is on the rise, and trading activity is coming back.
Most importantly, says Bove, is that investment psychology is shifting. "The attitude that banks are utilities that can never show earnings gains is disappearing. The view that bank asset values are overstated is gone or should be gone. The view that the government has multiple new ways to attack these companies is also disappearing."

Koeckert was a three-decade veteran at Merrill and frequently made the list of Barron's top advisers.Earlier this week, Merrill lost two other advisers with $185M in AUM to RBC, and two others with $620M for Morgan Stanley.The company has been on both sides of the tally though, and last week brought on 20 advisers (most from Barclays) managing more than $1.8B.Source: WSJ

More than six years after the bottom, only four of the globe's biggest banks sport stock prices trading at a premium to book value. Leading the way is UBS at about 1.4x book. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) also trade for north of book.
Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) - whose ROE of 2% is about one-tenth of what it was pre-crisis - brings up the rear at just about 0.5% of book. Barclays (NYSE:BCS) sells for roughly 0.7x book, and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) only slightly more than that.
Checking further on ROE, Goldman leads the way at about 12%. Citigroup (NYSE:C) is less than 5%, but stands out as being the only bank with a higher ROE today than before the crisis.
Looking at total return since the crisis, Goldman again leads the way at about 170%, with Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan a close second/third. Citigroup is the only major bank with a negative total return over that time frame.

Yield-starved financial sector names were mercilessly punished to start 2015 as sharply falling interest rates in January again disappointed investors waiting for the return of some spread income.
The rout in bond prices since, alongside what now seems the near-certainty of the beginning of Fed rate hikes in as soon as three months has helped turn things around, and the sector - as measured by the Financial Select SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLF) - is now in the green for the year, and trails the S&P 500 by just about 150 basis points.
Among the notable movers today as the 10-year yield rises to another 2015 high: Bank of America (BAC +1.4%), Wells Fargo (WFC +1.2%), U.S. Bancorp (USB +1.4%), Regions Financial (RF +1.3%), Huntington Bancshares (HBAN +1.6%), KeyCorp (KEY +1.6%), PNC Financial (PNC +1.3%), M&T (MTB +1.1%), Bank of Hawaii (BOH +1.6%), First Horizon (FHN +1.2%), Lincoln National (LNC +1.1%), E*Trade (ETFC +0.9%)

Cost-cutting is still a catalyst for Bank of America (BAC +2.5%), says JPMorgan's Vivek Juneja, noting the lender could add another $0.06 to annual EPS and improve its efficiency ratio by 100 basis points by cutting LAS expenses another $250M (as it plans to do). The bank has also just begun its SIM program (Simplify and Improve) to find cost savings which will free up money for growth investments.
Goldman Sachs (GS +0.5%), says the team at Wells Fargo, is set to benefit from continued strength in M&A, plus potential to see greater client activity as rates rise. The bank's greater expense flexibility suggests it will maintain a healthy ROE advantage to peers. The consensus for peer ROE next year is 8.8% - for Goldman to maintain its edge, says Wells, it would need to generate a ROE of 15.4% vs. the 14.7% it posted in Q1 this year.

 Any talks between Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) and Time Warner Cable (NYSE:TWC) about a merger may be up in the air, but bankers won't be the bottleneck, as they're ready to talk about $25B or even more to make it happen. Following previous reports that Charter could go for $25B-$30B in debt, the cableco is talking with the same four bankers that committed $24B to Charter's early-2014 bid: Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS), Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). As one banker noted, "it should be quick to move to next steps, as the banks know the company pretty well," and said the package should end up as two-thirds bonds. Aside from any regulatory issues, leverage seems to be foremost on the mind of dealmakers (and investors). Liberty Broadband's (NASDAQ:LBRDA) Greg Maffei has gone public with the notion that Liberty could raise capital through rights offerings or tap $700M in cash to help with funding while maintaining its 25% stake in Charter. Other banks could join in too, which could make such a deal one of the largest junk bonds ever. Time Warner's on the edge of junk status, rated BBB/Baa2 by S&P and Moody's.

Moynihan says comparisons may not be fair, noting the Countrywide purchase gave the bank more of a mortgage issue than peers.
Still, some investors question whether Moynihan's push to greater size and scale will ever pay off. Amid another stress test fumble and a disappointing Q1, BofA is lower by 7.7% YTD vs. a 2.2% gain for the KBW Bank Index. "We've been saying these guys can earn $1.70 or $1.80 [per share], but they continue to struggle to get just to $0.30," says FBR's Paul Miller.

More than seven years after the global financial collapse, regulators and investors are still working through a mile-high pile of lawsuits and other civil actions, and it seems like the fines keep on coming.
Since the crisis, banks and other institutions have paid more than $150B in fines, settlements and other penalties, according to a tally by FT. That compares with the roughly $700B in profits generated by U.S. banks between 2007 and 2014.
So where have all the payments gone? The biggest have landed in the Justice Department, which has collected some $50B. Other heavy collectors include the FHFA, Fannie Mae, HUD and the SEC.
Among the banks paying the biggest amounts, BofA (NYSE:BAC) tops the list - with nearly $58B, followed by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) ($31.3B), Citigroup (NYSE:C) ($12.8B) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) ($9.7B).

Apr. 28, 2015, 8:48 AM|Apr. 21, 2015, 9:37 PM|Low-rate "torture" for the regional lenders


"This whole discussion today about when interest rates move is torture for us,” said U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) CEO Richard Davis on last week's earnings call. “I remain very optimistic for the economy … a little less optimistic for the bankers until interest rates start to move up.”
Earlier today, Regions Financial (NYSE:RF) and Fifth Third (NASDAQ:FITB) became the latest in a line of lenders reporting slimming net interest margins. For Regions, the average yield on its loan portfolio fell to 3.45% from 4.03% a year ago. "You’re trying to book the prudent loans that you have the opportunity to, but with the level of competition in the market, it’s hard to move those rates up absent some kind of interest-rate increase," said Regions chief Grayson Hall on the earnings call.
On average, U.S. banks with more than $10B in assets showed a NIM of 2.97% in Q4, the lowest level in 25 years according to the FDIC ... And it got worse in Q1. Six of the nine big commercial banks reporting so far - including Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and PNC Financial - had Q1 margins lower than Q4.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Regions - two banks seen as particularly sensitive to interest rates - are unsurprisingly the worst performers in the KBW bank index (NYSEARCA:KBE) this year, off 13.9% and 9.3% respectively.
What to do? Regions, for one, is trying to emulate the Wall Street big boys by bulking up its wealth management and capital markets operations. And maybe there's some more fat to trim. “We’re going to turn up the heat on expenses…and we’ll see where we get to,” said PNC boss William Demchak on last week's conference call.

"Investors want to see more," says Morgan Stanley's Betsy Grasek, taking note of Bank of America's (BAC +1.5%) driving down of core expenses and legacy asset costs. The bank's compensation costs to revenue ratio, however, is the highest among both money center banks and the super-regionals (40% vs. median 34%). "We believe they have room to bring this down, especially in a low revenue environment."
She maintains an Overweight rating and $20 price target.
Oppenheimer also maintains its positive rating despite what it calls a "dreadful quarter" for BofA. The "one-time" charges of $1.5B for retirement-eligible incentive costs and market-related adjustements to NII may not be so "one-time," says the team, also noting that core expenses are not falling inline with revenue.

It's a low bar to cross for Bank of America (BAC -1.2%), say Citi analysts Keith Horowitz and Michael Cronin. Even though the Citi team's 2016 EPS estimate of $1.45 is well below the Street at $1.65, the stock trades at just a bit above tangible book value (reported at $14.79 as of March 31).
Combine that with BofA's being seen as a preferred vehicle to play Fed rate hikes given the bank's asset sensitivity, and it makes the stock a tactical buy.

Doing a sum of the parts analysis, Morgan Stanley slaps a regional bank multiple on Bank of America's (BAC +0.7%) consumer/other businesses and Goldman's multiple on BofA's investment bank/trading business, and finds the value comes to $15.70 - roughly the same as the current price.
This means the wealth management division - which Morgan values at $4.84 per share - comes for free. Morgan notes BofA has generated the strongest AUM growth among its large-cap bank peers over the past couple of years - 14% CAGR vs. peer median of 11%. The division has also generated revenue CAGR of 6% and pre-provision operating profit CAGR of 12%.
What's holding BAC back? Regulation and uncertainty over capital returns, of course, along with interest rates - investors continue to wait for higher ones and BofA is considered the most rate-sensitive of the big banks.

“We’ve got some growth still ahead of us in Latin America. We’ve already made a big investment there and will continue to do so,” says Assef.

Apr. 8, 2015, 11:19 AM|Apr. 5, 2015, 8:29 AM|Brokerages get tough with advisers who break rules


Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) is shaking up the ranks of its 14,000 brokers with an apparent zero-tolerance approach to brokers who break key company rules.
Case in point: A top Indiana adviser with $1.3B in AUM was terminated in March without advanced warning. Merrill said it "lost confidence" in the adviser, ranked No.1 in his state on the closely-followed Barron’s Top Adviser rankings since 2010, for  “conduct including failing to discuss service level and pricing alternatives with a customer, providing inaccurate information to firm management during account reviews regarding this issue, mismarking bond cross-trade order tickets as unsolicited and providing information to a client during an active account review that did not correspond to the firm’s records.”
In the past, brokerages tended to giving second chances to top producers. The new, tougher approach is seen largely as a response to closer regulatory scrutiny of brokerages.
Securities lawyers agree this attitude is taking hold in the industry. Even small violations, such as poor record keeping or email retention, are drawing stricter penalties.

Looking for some kind of growth wherever they can find it, banks are about to get their wish as Fair Isaac is set to launch a new credit scoring metric which should expand by tens of millions the field of those eligible to get credit.
The new score will pull payment histories for things like utilities to calculate credit scores for consumers who might otherwise not have one. Other things - like how often someone changes address - will be used to help calculate a score.
FICO and 10 unnamed credit card issuers have been testing the new score since November, and Fair Isaac intends to roll things out nationwide by year-end. Right now, about 15M of the 53M previously unscorable Americans can be scored using the new system.

The big banks have had a rough start to the year, but surging trading volume in bonds, currencies, and commodities in Q1 could make for pleasant surprises when the lenders report quarterly results next month, writes John Carney.
The average daily trading volume across all U.S. bonds was up 10.6% Y/Y through the end of February, according to Sifma, with trading in corporate bonds up 18.1%, driven by a big rise in issuance. Trading in Fannie, Freddie, and Ginnie MBS was up 35.3% from a year ago.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) could be a particular beneficiary, as about 25% of its revenue is generated by FICC, and Credit Suisse sees the bank posting its first year-over-year increase in that unit's revenue since 2009.

Citigroup's (C +2.7%) $7.8B in buybacks was 10% higher than estimated by MKM analyst David Trone. Combined with the nickel dividend, that's total shareholder returns of $8.4B vs. his $7B expectation.
Bank of America (BAC -1%) - though given just conditional approval - is set for $4B in buybacks and a nickel dividend. That's a total return of $6.1B vs. Trone's $3.1B estimate. Trone notes the bank can proceed with its buyback prior to resubmitting plans.
JPMorgan's (JPM +1%) $6.4B buyback was shy of Trone's $7B estimate, but the 10% dividend increase was better than forecast. The total capital return of $12.9B vs. his $13.2B forecast is a "marginal negative."
The dividend hike to $0.65 at Goldman (GS +2.1%) beat Trone's expectation of $0.62. As for the buyback, Goldman's policy of not disclosing the amount remains in place.
Morgan Stanley's (MS +4.5%) capital return of $4.3B is more than double Trone's $1.9B estimate.

A year ago Bank of America's capital return plans were initially approved, but then embarrassingly rescinded after discovery of a calculation error (they were approved again after redoing the numbers).

 Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan reportedly took a 7% pay cut in 2014 to $13M, down from a personal record $14M a year  earlier. Moynihan received $11.5M in stock-based  compensation, down from $12.5M for 2013, while his base salary remained unchanged at $1.5M. The payout for shows BofA’s board at least kept the CEO’s paycheck moving in the same direction as the company’s bottom line, which plunged 58% in 2014, weighed down by the costs of the DoJ settlement and other litigation; the bank’s profit did increase across most major units, including consumer and business banking and global markets.

Not this stuff again, one imagines Bank of America (BAC -0.9%) shareholders saying.
According to the WSJ, BofA's U.S. banking subsidiary for years has helped finance transactions from the bank's European investment bank arm which, among other things, helped hedge funds avoid taxes on stock dividends. According to the Journal, BofA has made about $1B in revenue from "dividend arbitrage" since the financial crisis.
The practice - which drew the attention of regulators both for reputational risk as well as the need to wall off insured deposits from risky trades - has ended, says a bank spokesman.

Among the upside catalysts for Citigroup (C +0.4%) - says Deutshce in its upgrade of the stock to Buy from Hold - will be the approval of $4B in share repurchases in this spring's CCAR.
Citi's plans to buy back stock and boost the dividend have been rejected by the Fed twice in the last three years, and CEO Michael Corbat has staked his job on approval this year.
Another catalyst, says Deutsche, will be the sale or IPO of OneMain Financial.
Turning back to the CCAR, Detusche expects the largest increases in capital returns to be at Citi, Bank of America (BAC +0.6%), Regions Financial (RF +0.3%), Morgan Stanley (MS +1.1%), SunTrust (STI +0.1%), and Citizens Financial (CFG +1.9%). Total payout ratios at the larger regional lenders should be 79% this year, up 1000 basis points from 2014.

Bank of America (BAC) confirms plans to lay off 202 mortgage servicing workers in Norfolk, Virginia by March 29.The continued cuts in Legacy Asset Servicing come as the numbers of bad mortgages being serviced by the bank continue to dwindle. At its peak, LAS had over 42K workers servicing troubled mortgages, but more than half of those positions have been eliminated.The bank's overall headcount at year-end was 223.7K vs. a peak of more than 290K in 2011.

"The jury’s conclusion that this was a massive and intentional fraud was amply supported by the evidence," says federal judge Jed Rakoff, denying Bank of America's (BAC +2.4%) appeal for a new trial over a Countrywide mortgage-lending program known charmingly known as "Hustle."
A jury two  years ago found the bank liable to the tune of $1.27B.
No check will be written yet, as the denial clears the way for BofA to file another motion in appeals court, potentially setting up another long battle with the DOJ.
The case is perhaps most interesting as most bank's typically settle these affairs well before they get in front of a jury, but BofA decided to let this one play out.

As for operating results, whether they come in good or not so good this year hinges on whether the Fed hikes or not. That forecast sounds a lot like 2014, 2013, and 2012, but the two note the likelihood of higher rates appears far higher this year.

It's something Bank of America (BAC -1.6%) hasn't done in more than a decade, writes Deon Roberts - opening a branch in a new market.
This week, the bank cut the ribbon on a branch in Denver, its first in that state, and BofA says there's more to come. In addition, the bank plans to open its first branch in Minnesota in Q2. It will come in Minneapolis and be followed by other branches in the Twin Cities area over the next two years.
The moves are particularly noteworthy as BofA is rapidly closing branches in other U.S. markets, but CEO Brian Moynihan is making a point of having retail locations in major markets where the bank is already serving customers and businesses through its U.S. Trust and Merrill Lynch units. “We’ll go to other markets largely just to complete the footprint,” says Moynihan.

With Bank of America (BAC -3.1%) getting battered again (now off 13.8% YTD) after this morning's mixed earnings report, let's get a bull's take:
EPS was about inline despite the revenue miss, says Evercore ISI's Glen Schorr, and the bank still has a good story to tell on expenses (off 8%, ex-litigation), capital, leverage, and credit. Consumer & business banking, wealth management, and global banking are all performing well and are why investors will be patient on BAC as a U.S. economy/higher interest rate play.
"Our gut is investors will be bummed about the revenue decline but stick with the stock as story hasn’t changed and valuation is a lot more palatable post the recent drop.”

"FICC trading tends to do best in a rising rate environment when activity levels rise as rates rise," says Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) CFO Bruce Thompson on the earnings call.

2015 has opened much like 2014, with interest rates doing the exact opposite of what most expected, and falling sharply. It's a tough start for bank investors who have been counting on higher interest rates to help boost earnings for a number of years.
In the meantime, deposits keep rolling in, and the pace of lending growth isn't quick enough to absorb all the money. In 2014, loan balances rose 4.4%, but securities holdings popped 12%, and cash assets jumped 22%.
The good part of falling yields are unrealized gains on those security portfolios - negative a year ago, they're were in the green by about $15B on Dec. 31. More good news, says Goldman's Richard Ramsden: Valuations. The big banks are priced at about 9.9x estimated 2016 earnings, allowing for some nice upside if and when rates do decide to go higher.

The collapse in oil prices is set to crimp one of the few fast growth areas for banks since the financial crisis - lending to the energy industry. Right now, we're just talking about a slowdown in lending, but Charles Peabody - who saw the losses incurred by Texas banks during the 1980s energy slump - expects the current situation to lead to losses as well.
"It’s been a hot industry, probably a little too hot,” says Cullen/Frost (NYSE:CFR) CEO Dick Evans, whose bank has a sizable energy business. “But it is not time to panic. We have been in the game a long time. I am comfortable with what we have been doing.”
The flip side of energy issues might be stronger business for banks elsewhere as consumers find themselves with more money in their pockets after filling up.
Among the more sizable banks, Scotiabank (NYSE:BNS) leads the way with 34.6% of its investment banking revenue coming from energy companies. Next is RBC (NYSE:RY), with 20.2%, and then Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) with 14.9% and Citigroup (NYSE:C) with 11.8%.

Jefferies yesterday posted a 73% plunge in fixed-income trading revenue for the quarter ended Nov. 30, and a 45% fall in equity-trading revenue. “You’re going to see weaker trading results because of what I’d call bad volatility,” says Charles Peabody, as firms cut back on stock and bond offerings.
That Q4 trading revenue is going to be a weak one for the likes of JPM, C, BAC, GS, and MS shouldn't be a major surprise as Ciit's Mike Corbat, BofA's Brian Moynihan, and JPM's Marianne Lake said as much when presenting at a financial services conference earlier this month. But the weakness they described is nowhere near what was reported at Jefferies.
Alongside the weak trading results, Jefferies is also looking to get rid of Bache - its commodities-trading business. "The fact that they are throwing in the towel on this business just a few years in would suggest that maybe that opportunity is not nearly as robust as they thought it would be,” says UBS's Brennan Hawken.

"You could shut down a bank today and if the reserves are correct you would get back the tangible book value." Both are trading a lot closer to book (or even above) then they were when he first invested, but Pabrai considers them still undervalued and expects they'll eventually trade more inline with the higher P/B and P/E multiples of Wells Fargo and JPMorgan.

A combination of new regulations and near-zero interest rates has some banks - including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup (NYSE:C), HSBC, Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) - privately telling larger clients to take their deposits elsewhere or face fees on accounts which have long been free.
“Ultimately my balances aren’t as profitable for the banks, and that’s going to impact my business,” says an executive with a title insurance company, complaining of sleepless nights amid negotiations with his bankers.
BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) has begun charging institutional clients money to park money in euros, and State Street (NYSE:STT) says itwill soon begin doing so.
Some bankers are advising large clients to break up large deposits across a number of lenders (including smaller banks not subject to the new regulations), and other corporations are going to find themselves needing to build more sophisticated (and riskier) portfolios likely including vehicles like short-term bond funds and uninsured money-market funds.

"Our concern is that the market has become complacent on the setting of the SIFI surcharge for the mega banks, which means there may be surprise at just how onerous the surcharge could be for JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)," writes Guggenheim's Jaret Seiberg.

A positive macro outlook for the U.S. (especially compared to the rest of the globe) should boost credit demand, says UBS - upgrading U.S. financials (NYSEARCA:XLF) to Overweight - while the start of a new rate-hike cycle next year bodes well for interest margins.
UBS's three favored U.S. banks are Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), but TD Bank (NYSE:TD) also makes the buy list thanks to its large American presence.

Dec. 1, 2014, 11:40 AM|Nov. 29, 2014, 8:00 AM|Easier mortgage standards on the way


New guidelines - set to take full effect on December 1 - are the result of an agreement reached last month between banks and the GSEs meant to clarify exactly when lenders could be called to task for mortgages sold to Fannie Mae (OTCQB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac (OTCQB:FMCC) which ultimately default. Since the financial crisis, Fannie and Freddie have forced banks to repurchase billions of dollars worth of mortgages, leaving them naturally gun-shy about making new loans to all but the most pristine of credits.
“It’s providing greater certainty for all the parties so that you can lend more confidently and make the whole judgment process much easier and more clear cut,” says Mike Heid, president of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) Home Mortgage. Along with SunTrust (NYSE:STI), Wells says borrowers should begin to see initial changes - such as faster processing times, reduced credit score requirements, and greater leeway to those whose credit history suffered due to one-time events - in a few weeks.
"We will be able to be looser and open up the net wider," says Mason-McDuffie Mortgage CEO Bill Godfrey, now expecting to make loans down to a 620 credit score from 660 previously.
Not everyone agrees: “Unless we are convinced that the rules are going to be permanent and there is not going to be a look back or a reach back in future times…we are simply going to stay on the sidelines," U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) boss Richard Davis has said, and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan made similar comments at a recent conference.
 

Nov. 29, 2014, 8:00 AM|Nov. 26, 2014, 11:50 AM|Court ruling paves way for BofA's $16.7B mortgage settlement


At issue was a SEC case against Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) mostly for mortgage-related wrongdoing by Merrill Lynch and Countrywide before the bank purchased the two. In this case, BofA will disgorge $109.2M in profit, $6.62M in interest, and pay a civil penalty of $109.2M.
The clearing of this case will allow the $16.7B global mortgage settlement to move forward.
 

Nov. 26, 2014, 11:50 AM|Nov. 17, 2014, 11:05 AM|Supreme Court takes on BofA second mortgages cases


The two cases both come from Florida and involve so-called "stripping off," where a homeowner in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing can void second mortgage debt when the first mortgage is greater than a home's value.
An appeals court allowed the practice, but Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) says the approach taken by the court is different than that of other appeals courts around the country and thousands of pending cases could be affected.
 

Nov. 17, 2014, 11:05 AM|Nov. 13, 2014, 10:17 AM|Banks probed for violating bankruptcy laws

Real sweethearts if you believe the reports, the likes of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) are being investigated by the Feds for still going after borrowers after their debt has been legally discharged in a bankruptcy.Paying little attention to such court-ordered discharges, the banks reportedly are keeping the debt alive on credit reports, more or less attempting to force borrowers to pay on bills which they no longer owe.The issue, say sources, is the way banks report to credit agencies. Once a debt is voided through bankruptcy, creditors must update credit reports showing that debt is cleared. Banks, however, routinely fail to do so, instead leaving notations of "past due" or "charged off." A clerical mistake would be one thing, but, according to a number of bankruptcy judges,, banks refuse to make corrections unless the borrower pays.The banks contend they are complying with all federal laws in their collection and sale of debt. Class-action suits have also been filed and the banks are trying to have them thrown out, arguing its third-party debt buyers who are in control. 

Nov. 13, 2014, 10:17 AM|Nov. 12, 2014, 1:02 PM|Moynihan: BofA not about to lower mortgage standards


The FHFA wants to ease lending standards - allowing down payments of as little as 3% - but Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) won't be playing along, says CEO Brian Moynihan, speaking at a BAML conference.
Webcast replay
"I don't think there's a big incentive for us to start to try to create more mortgage availability where the customers are susceptible to default," he says, and those who can't come up with at least a 10% down payment should probably consider remaining as renters. "You won't see us start to expand our criteria much past what we've done today."
Given the shell-shock from the unceasing legal assault and put-back demands, can BofA or any other lender be blamed?

In what appears to be in addition to the already-announced global $3.4B fine for banks over forex manipulation, the OCC announces $950M in penalties against Bank of America (BAC -0.6%), JPMorgan (JPM -1.1%), and Citigroup (C -0.7%) for "unsafe or unsound" practices related to their forex trading operations.
BofA will pay $250M, JPM $350M, and Citi $350M.

Nov. 12, 2014, 10:32 AM|Nov. 12, 2014, 2:24 AM|Global banks fined $4.3B in forex probe


Global regulators have fined six major banks, including UBS (NYSE:UBS), HSBC (NYSE:HSBC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and BofA (NYSE:BAC), a total of $4.3B over allegations of price fixing and manipulating benchmarks in the $5T-a-day foreign exchange market.
The penalties were imposed by Britain's Financial Services Authority, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Swiss regulator FINMA.
Barclays (NYSE:BCS) had been expected to be part of the settlement but the FCA said its investigation into the U.K. bank was continuing.
 

Nov. 12, 2014, 2:24 AM|Nov. 10, 2014, 4:13 PM|Bank of America FICC chief retiring

David Sobotka, Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) global head of fixed income, currencies, and commodities trading will exit by year's end, reports the WSJ, citing an internal memo. He was named co-head of FICC trading in 2011 and took on the role by himself a little more than a year ago.Slow FICC business has been a sore point for the major banks for more than a year now, but the declines were never as deep at BofA as they were for some competitors, and FICC revenue at the bank rose 11% to $2.25B in Q3. Among the reasons for Sobotka's exit, says a source, is his comfort with that speedier-than-expected rebound. 

Nov. 10, 2014, 4:13 PM|Nov. 6, 2014, 5:13 PM|Bank of America adds another $400M in Q3 legal expense


Owing to the now fast-moving probes over foreign exchange manipulation, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is recording a $400M Q3 pretax charge, thus cutting its previously stated $70M quarterly loss to a $232M or $0.04 share loss. Even with GAAP losses in two out of the last four quarters, BofA earned about $4.7B over the 12 months ending September 30.

Nov. 6, 2014, 5:13 PM|Oct. 27, 2014, 12:03 PM|BofA's mortgage settlement hung up on SEC infighting


The $16.7B settlement supposedly agreed to in August is being held up by two Democratic SEC commissioners over waiving additional sanctions set to kick in when the deal is entered in court. The two Republican commissioners are fine with the waivers, and the swing vote - SEC Chair Mary Jo White - isn't participating due to a conflict.
At issue is political pressure that lawmakers have been too soft on Wall Street. Banks typically seek - and are granted - three key waivers when settling cases, with the most important one being a ban on managing mutual funds. For Bank of America (BAC -1.1%), the key waiver would allow it to continue seeking investors for private firms like tech companies which haven't yet gone public.
The waivers are often one of the reasons financial firms decide to settle cases rather than go to trial. “The commission and its staff should not be in the business of rubber-stamping and approving all waiver applications simply because a request is made,” says Commissioner Luis Aguilar, one of the two who are holding the settlement up.

Not having had the pleasure of being subject to the stress test and CCAR previously, Deutsche Bank's (NYSE:DB) U.S. unit will be a participant next year
As in prior years, those BHCs with large trading operations - BAC, C, GS, JPM, MS, WFC - will be required to factor in a global market shock as part of their scenarios.
Those six, plus STT and BK - thanks to their custodial operations - will be required to incorporate a counterparty default scenario.
Among the items in the severely adverse scenario is the unemployment rate jumping to 10%, a 60% dive in the stock market, and oil jumping to $110 per barrel (how about oil falling to $10 per barrel?).

The MBA index rose 11.6% for the week ended October 17, the largest gain since January as mortgage rates continued to decline - the average 30-year fixed mortgage coming in at 4.1%, the lowest since May 2013.
Leading the way were refinancings, with that gauge jumping 23.3%, the biggest move since January 2012 (purchase applications fell 4.6%).
Should the trend continue, the now-lean mortgage operations at places like Wells Fargo (WFC +0.2%), JPMorgan (JPM +0.2%), and Bank of America (BAC +0.2%), among others, should provide a nice boost to Q4 results.

"Given drastically reduced litigation expenses going forward, we think the core earnings power of the company should begin to accrete to existing shareholders, allowing book value growth at a company that has struggled to grow TBV since the crisis," says FBR's Paul Miller, upgrading Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) to Outperform, with price target lifted to $20 from $18.
On target cost savings, he says, has proven management's ability to execute its strategy to improve shareholder returns, and he sees the possibility for 2015 EPS to exceed his $1.60 estimate.

Bank earnings models will no doubt need to be tweaked as the sure thing of higher rates becomes somewhat less sure, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield plunging all the way down to 2%, and 30-day Fed Funds futures - just weeks ago pricing in 100% chance of a rate hike by June 2015 - now sees no move until December 2015.

Oct. 15, 2014, 10:49 AM|Oct. 15, 2014, 9:29 AM|BofA call: Assumption about higher rates not so sure anymore


We listen to what the market is telling us, says Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) management on the earnings call, responding to a question from Mike Mayo about whether the bank is changing its interest rate assumptions given the sharp drop in yields of late (the 10-year Treasury yield is now down a whopping 17 bps today to 2.03%).

Webcast live and recorded (later) in available on Seeking Alpha.
Presentation slides
Getting into more detail, Mayo asks what would happen to the bank's earnings and ROE targets in 2015 if, in fact, rates do not go higher. CEO Moynihan: We'll do what we're doing now - that is trying to grow the business where it can. He notes core earnings in Consumer & Business Banking rose 15% from a year ago, Wealth Management up 3%, Global Banking up 8%, and Global Markets up 10%.

Noninterest expense of $19.7B vs. $16.4B a year ago. Excluding litigation expense, noninterest expense of $14.2B fell 7% Y/Y, thanks to sizable personnel cutbacks (mostly in legacy mortgage).
Consumer and Business Banking net income of $1.856B vs. $1.787B a year ago. Average deposit balances up 4%. Mobile banking customers up 15% to 16.1M - 11% of deposits were made via mobile vs. 8% a year ago.

Global growth, foreign-exchange, oil, and small caps are the subject of every client inquiry, says David Kostin. His team's recommendation: Buy "American exceptionalism."
In Kostin's view, U.S. economy and corporate fundamentals are still strong, with economic growth expected by Goldman economists to be 3.2% next year, the fastest expansion since 2005. Europe is expected to grow just 1%.
What his team likes are those stocks of companies which have a high proportion of domestic sales, plus sectors like Consumer Staples (XLP -0.1%) and Discretionary (XLY +0.7%) which stand to benefit from lower oil prices (plunging again today).
As for small caps (IWM +0.9%), Kostin is wary, noting downward earnings revisions have boosted small cap P/E ratios even as prices have declined.

"Steadily improving economic and capital markets backdrop will drive investment banking and loan growth higher, while trading is likely to rebound as the extended period of low volume and volatility is starting to shift back toward more normal conditions in September," say MKM's David Trone and Pankaj Chitrakar, expecting to see earnings for five bulge-bracket banks higher by 11% in Q3.
The team remains bullish on all five, but sees just four - Citigroup (C -0.9%), Bank of America (BAC +0.5%), Goldman Sachs (GS +0.5%), and Morgan Stanley (MS +0.4%) - beating estimates. JPMorgan (JPM +0.3%) should just meet the $1.38 EPS consensus, they say, with strength in investment banking offset by declining mortgage banking.

The banking industry is very close to resolving too big to fail, says Jamie Dimon (JPM +0.6%), speaking publicly for the first time since his cancer diagnosis (other than his July earnings call appearance). He's appearing at a conference roundtable alongside Morgan Stanley's (MS +0.8%) James Gorman, Deutsche's (DB -0.9%) Anshu Jain, and Bank of America's (BAC +0.7%) Brian Moynihan.
Webcast here
The most pointed remarks so far come from Deutsche's Jain, who tells those who would continue to further strangle the banks with more regulation to look to Europe. Straightforward banking - taking deposits and making loans - is far more the norm there then here, he says, and the forcing of banks to trim businesses and balance sheets is a large contributor to the Continent's stagnant growth.

The usual banking suspects are falling under the gaze of regulators for a trading strategy known as "dividend arbitrage" which helps their hedge fund clients reduce taxes, and from which the banks earn more than $1B in fees annually.
The strategy - typically run from London - involves banks temporarily transferring ownership of stock to a lower-tax jurisdiction about the time when the client expects to receive a dividend on those shares. It's perfectly legal say the banks and hedge funds.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), however, has been questioned by the Richmond Fed (Charlotte comes under its purview) about the legal and reputational risks of such maneuvers, reports the WSJ.
It isn't clear if other banks have been similarly questioned, but a number of other lenders do the same thing. Among the hedge funds which benefit from dividend arbitrage is Och-Ziff Capital Management (NYSE:OZM).

 Today's resignation of Attorney General Eric Holder could mark the beginning of the end of the Justice Department’s push to hold big banks accountable for their conduct leading up to the financial crisis. Several big banks, including Goldman Sachs (GS -2.1%) and Wells Fargo (WFC -1.1%), are still under investigations by the Justice Department for their sale of flawed mortgage securities before 2008, but settlements in those cases are expected to be much smaller than the big sums extracted from Bank of America (BAC -1.8%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM -2%) and Citigroup (C -2.2%). Another sign that the big bank cases may be winding down: Tony West, who was Holder’s point man in the bank settlement talks, recently left the Justice Department to join PepsiCo as its general counsel.

Sep. 23, 2014, 3:50 PM|Sep. 20, 2014, 9:00 AM|Barron's makes the bull case for Bank of America


"Starting next year," writes Jack Hough in Barron's, "BofA (NYSE:BAC) investors will get a glimpse of two things they haven't seen in years: a fairly clean income statement and a decent dividend." Litigation costs are set to nail the bank again this quarter, but then will begin to quickly clear away, leaving investors to focus on the bank's operations. Earnings per share - an estimated $0.75 this year - could hit $2 in 2017, and the annual dividend ($0.20 now) could rise to $0.55.
CEO Brian Moynihan notes core pretax profit in four of BofA's five units was $8.5B in Q2, up from $6.8B two years ago. Business #5 is mortgages, and that provided a $4.5B loss thanks to now rapidly fading legacy issues. Litigation costs make most of the headlines, but there's also non-litigation expenses like modifying some loans and foreclosing on others. These costs dropped to $1.4B last quarter from $2.3B a year earlier, and are expected to fall to $500M in 2015.
Upgrading BofA to a Buy earlier this month, Goldman - looking past litigation and other one-time items - says the bank has had the largest reduction in earnings volatility of any of its peers in recent years and the stablest trading revenues since 2013. The beacon is Wells Fargo - earnings stability and a higher dividend has that stock trading at a premium 1.7x book value. BofA is at 0.8x, and as its steadier earnings begin to become clearer, that valuation discount should narrow.
Bank of America is also underowned, says Goldman, noting its weighting in mutual funds relative to its weighting in the S&P 500 is the second lowest among 25 large financials (the lowest is Berkshire Hathaway).

Isn't this one of the ways we got into the housing mess? Citigroup (NYSE:C) signs on with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) to fund 15-year mortgages at below-market rates for borrowers with low incomes, spotty credit histories, or both.
The loans are being originated by the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America (NACA), a group - that has the ear of HUD - known for pushing banks to show they're fulfilling the terms required of them by the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (no redlining).
The moves also follow the banks' massive mortgage settlements, part of which were agreements to provide assistance to troubled mortgagees, though both say this new program is not related.
For its part, NACA says the foreclosure-loss rate on more than 18K purchase loans it has originated since 2006 is about 0%, with one of the reasons being NACA making up to three months of mortgage payments when borrowers run into trouble.

The other savings initiative - Legacy Assets and Servicing costs are expected to fall to $1.1B by 2015 Q1. They were $1.4B in Q2 of this year.
Presentation slides
Turning to capital, the bank's fully phased-in Basel 3 common equity tier 1 ratio of 9.9% compares to the proposed minimum of 8.5% by 2019.
As for net interest income, it's holding steady - $10.4B in Q2 vs. $10.5B two years ago - but, like everyone else in financial services, the bank awaits higher interest rates for growth in this segment.
Credit quality trends continue to improve, and the bank is highly provisioned: Its allowance for loans and losses - $15.8B in Q2 vs. $21.2B two years ago - is 3.67x the annualized charge-off rate vs. 2.51x two years ago.
Guidance for capital returns in 2015? The new CCAR rules aren't even out yet, says Thompson, but the bank is particularly focused on improving its metrics at those points where it was closest to failing in this year's test.

The rules are requiring large U.S. banks to load up on ultra-safe assets to ensure enough cash and securities to fund their operations for 30 days. Separate liquidity rules for foreign banks will be drawn up at a later date.

Low interest rates, weak trading, and "government persecution" are the three factors, and - should these normalize - earnings could nearly double at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C), though JPMorgan's (NYSE:JPM) boost would be more modest.

Another cheap sector is energy, says Pzena, and based on relative valuation against the broader market - whether price-to-book or price-to-earnings - the major integrated oil companies are selling near all-time lows.
What the market is missing, says Pzena, is the nature of oil investment. The old days saw capital spending one year, and boosted volume the next.

"Despite the thousands of pages of material these firms submitted, the plans provide no credible or clear path through bankruptcy that doesn't require unrealistic assumptions and direct or indirect public support," says the FDIC's #2 official, Thomas Hoenig.

Wall Street firms led by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are closing in on a deal to purchase a stake in chat and instant messaging start-up Perzo as an alternative to Bloomberg's similar application, Reuters reports.
Bloomberg has dominated Wall Street for years, but banks have been looking for a substitute as sluggish trading volumes and higher regulations weigh on revenues. Bloomberg's trading and news terminal costs about $20,000 a year, while Perzo's applications are open-source and free. Bloomberg customers must also buy an entire terminal, and cannot just buy the messaging system and adapt it.
Several other banks and asset managers have received term sheets for the Perzo deal and have recently signed non-disclosure agreements including Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), HSBC (NYSE:HSBC), and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK).
Goldman has been looking at alternatives to Bloomberg's messaging program for years, and launched a project internally called "Babel" in early 2013 to develop a competitor.

Bank of America (BAC -0.5%) had previously offered $13B, with just $4B of that in cash, to financial crisis-era mortgage issues with the U.S., but the NYT says the bank has upped its offer to $14B, and the cash portion to $7B.
The DOJ however, wants $17B, has rejected the offer, and has threatened a lawsuit within days if a deal doesn't come.
Underscoring why no bank wants to see the inside of a courtroom on this, yesterday a judge ordered BofA to pay nearly $1.3B in another federal mortgage case.
 

Jul. 31, 2014, 9:48 AM|Jul. 30, 2014, 4:05 PM|BofA ordered to pay $1.3B in "hustle" case


Calling it a "brazen fraud" in which the Countrywide set up a scheme to sell toxic mortgages to the GSEs, Judge Jed Rakoff orders Bank of America (BAC +1.6%) to pay a $1.3B fine.
The fine is less than the $2.1B sought by the government, more sharply higher than what the bank had hoped to pay.
BofA: "We believe that this figure simply bears no relation to a limited Countrywide program that lasted several months and ended before Bank of America’s acquisition of the company. We’re reviewing the ruling and will assess our appellate options.”

The big banks aren't quite ready to let go of their reserve releases: The big four - JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) - released a combined $2.25B of their bad-loan reserves in Q2, up nearly 20% from the $1.88B they released in Q1.
The banks continue to see improvement in their customers’ credit quality, but their earnings continue to rely in part on freeing up some of their rainy-day cushions, rather than being able to generate strong earnings from their operating businesses.
Even with the Q2 uptick, the banks are releasing less in the way of reserves than they have for most of the past four years, and analysts see the practice ending before too much longer.
Some regional banks such as Comerica (NYSE:CMA) and Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN) that had been releasing reserves started building their reserves up again by small amounts during Q2.

The bank last March originally received Fed permission to boost its quarterly payout from $0.01 to $0.05 (along with a $4B buyback), but was forced to withdraw that plan after discovering it miscalculated capital levels.
Bank of America (BAC) subsequently fixed the accounting issue and resubmitted a capital plan in May, and the WSJ reports the lender is requesting the same size dividend, though the buyback plan has been toned down.
For the bank - which has made boosting the dividend a top priority - the move projects to the Fed a sign of strength and that there are no more accounting cockroaches out there. For the Fed, its decision will establish a precedent for how these errors might be dealt with in the future.
All this is happening as pressure mounts for BofA to come to a settlement with the DOJ over mortgages, and word is Eric Holder has no interest in talking turkey with Brian Moynihan until their lieutenants get a lot closer to a final deal.

Eric Holder says he will not meet with BofA (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan to discuss a settlement over the bank's mortgage lawsuit with the Justice Department, Reuters reports. The Attorney General states that the "parties remain too far apart for a meeting to be productive."
In prior negotiations over the shoddy mortgage selling lawsuit, BofA discussed paying $12B to resolve the claims, although the Justice Department countered with a $17B settlement .
JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon previously cut a $13B deal with Holder regarding his bank's involvement with its mortgage selling before the financial crisis, and BofA was seeking a similar negotiation.

The reported $7B settlement would amount to 7.7% of Citigroup's (C -0.3%) pre-crisis issuance vs. JPMorgan's 2% settlement - this despite the fact that losses on Citi's MBS book were inline with its peer group. Nevertheless, the team notes these press rumors have been somewhat on the mark and cut their Q2 EPS estimate by $0.70 to $0.40 to account for the $4B hard-dollar amount (the other $3B is for borrower relief).
Up next is Bank of America (BAC -0.2%), which will now see boosted pressure to reach a deal with the DOJ, and Morgan has baked in a $12B settlement, or 1.8% of the face amount of securities issued. Other press reports have suggested a number closer to $17B.

Combine that with valuation - BofA sells for 8.8x 2015 EPS vs. Goldman at 9.7x, JPMorgan at 9.1x, and Citi at 9x - and expense reductions which should be better than peers, and Bank of America could be the buy of the group.

Banks could lose up to $4.5B in annual revenue as new regulations alter how swaps are traded, according to a report from McKinsey & Co. That amount is equal to 35% of the $13B in revenue booked by banks from trading in rate derivatives, and it comes at a time when FICC business is already on the decline.
At issue are new rules requiring swaps trade on electronic systems rather than over the phone ("Thanks, big boy"), and the greater transparency should bite into profits. To counter this, says McKinsey's Roger Rudisuli, banks will have to cut costs and realign teams to focus attention on fewer customers.
The usual suspects make up the 5 largest U.S. swaps dealers: JPM, C, BAC, GS, and MS.

Among the benefits of the program are lower rates on mortgages and home equity loans, higher rates on savings accounts, and free stock trades.
The move comes as the bank looks for ways to boost revenue and the targets of the program are those households with a little scratch, but not wealthy enough to be Merrill Lynch or U.S. Trust customers.

"Deeply troubling and offensive," Lawsky tells Reuters, promising an investigation.
A PNC spokesperson: "These clauses are part of the consideration we receive for agreeing to settle the case. This helps to ensure that the discussion is not re-opened in public after the case has been settled."
"When [we] take a closer look at some of these non-bank servicers, we find corners being cut, to the disadvantage of homeowners," said Lawsky in a speech yesterday, in which he makes clear his serious issues with the business models of companies like Ocwen (and affiliates like ASPS), Nationstar Mortgage (NSM -0.7%), and Walter Investment (WAC -2.4%).

At Bank of America (BAC), it's the trading slowdown, the suspension of the buyback, and worry over litigation costs. The Q2 EPS estimate is cut to $0.30 from $0.33, and full year is lowered by a dime to $0.90. The team at KBW sees this year's buyback being halved to $2B after the Fed is finished with its review, but is more worried about how future legal costs will affect profitability.

May 12, 2014, 9:29 AM|May 9, 2014, 3:26 PM|Mortgages: Go big


“Jumbos are growing while almost everything else is dead,” says FBR's Paul Miller. “Big banks need loan growth. If they were getting decent commercial loan growth, they wouldn’t be so aggressive on competing for jumbos.”
As the rest of the home loan market contracts (sharply), applications for jumbo mortgages (above $729K) were up 4.9% Y/Y in March. Another reason for banks plowing into jumbos: They don't have to pay the higher guarantee fees charged by the GSEs, allowing them to actually charge lower rates than on conforming loans. At Wells Fargo (WFC), the current rate for a 30-year fixed jumbo mortgage of 4.13% is 12 basis points less than that for a conventional mortgage loan.
JPMorgan (JPM) is boosting its efforts and created a special process to review all declined loans to make sure the decisions make sense. It also has a group working with wealthier clients who have more complex financial situations, such as being self-employed. The bank's jumbo mortgage originations accounted for 21% of all mortgages in Q1, up from 10% a year earlier.
At Bank of America (BAC -1.7%) the down payment required for most jumbos less than $1M was cut this year to 15% from 20%, and nonconforming originations in Q1 were 37% of all mortgages vs. 22% last year.

Other issues: "Poor governance, including missing a compensation committee head, different time frames in financial charts, and a meeting that ended before all questions were taken, not to mention a chairman who seems to us like a figurehead." Mayo notes CEO Moynihan ran the entire meeting while Chairman Chad Holliday only gave a few "mostly nonresponsive answers."
Positives: The U.S. consumer banking arm, the investment bank, and wealth management.
Mayo continues to rate the stock a Sell with $15 price target.

He didn't want to "go to war" with management, says Warren Buffett, responding to the first question asked of him at the Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) annual meeting: Why did he abstain from voting on the controversial equity compensation plan for Coca-Cola (KO) executives?
"You keep belching at the dinner table, you'll be eating in the kitchen," says Buffett, describing the clubby culture of corporate boards where being agreeable keeps you on the inside and being confrontational gets you blackballed. "I've voted for compensation plans in various places that are far from what I would have designed myself ... That is the way boards work."
A shareholder proposal requesting Berkshire board consideration of a dividend received less than 2% of the vote, pleasing to Buffett who believes he and Charlie Munger can do a better job of allocating company capital than returning it to shareholders. Still, with $40B and rising in Berkshire's coffers, even Buffett concedes the day is coming when the company has "more cash than we can intelligently invest."
"That error that they made doesn't bother me," says Buffett of Bank of America (BAC), which had to suspend its capital return plan after miscalculating capital levels. "It doesn't change my feeling about Bank of America's risk management one iota."
Mungerisms: Comparing Berkshire book value to the S&P 500 is "insane" and makes it harder for Buffett to look good. "Warren sets a ridiculously high standard. The last couple of years added $60B in value ... If that's failure, then I want more of it."

With Q1 results for the global banks just in the books, JPMorgan (JPM) becomes the first to warn on trading revenues in Q2, expecting markets revenue to slip 20% after declining 17% in Q1.
SEC Form 10-Q
As in the past, the biggest driver of the slide is weakness in fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) as investors continue to shy from exotic fixed-income vehicles contrived by bankers, and instead favor less profitable (for the bond desks) government and high-grade corporate bonds. There's also new regulations which have forced banks away from lucrative businesses like energy trading.
"I don't look at the $5 billion in markets revenue and cry in my soup," said CEO Jamie Dimon on Q1's earnings call (the bank did $5.37B in trading business in Q1), stressing his belief that the current tough time for trading is cyclical not secular.
JPMorgan fell 1.5% in after hours trading following the news last night. Morgan Stanley (MS) -0.5%, Goldman Sachs (GS) -0.1%, Bank of America (BAC) -0.7%, Citigroup (C) -0.4%: "Certainly J.P. Morgan's forecast does not bode well for the other big banks," says RBC's Gerard Cassidy.

Other firms on the list include  JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), AIG (AIG), GE (GE), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), State Street (STT), Prudential Financial (PRU), Barclays (BCS), Credit Suisse (CS), Deutsche Bank (DB) and UBS (UBS).

May 2, 2014, 3:42 AM|Apr. 29, 2014, 11:09 AM|BofA blunder likely means no buyback this year


Yesterday's selloff in Bank of America (BAC +1.1%) was likely overdone in light of the bank's capital levels, says Morgan Stanley's Betsy Graseck, suggesting the end result will be BofA scrapping a buyback this year, but reinstating the dividend boost (to $0.05 per share quarterly from $0.01). CLSA's Mike Mayo, on the other hand, says the mistake raises doubt about controls, and reiterates his Sell rating.
Goldman's Richard Ramsden says the bank likely would have failed this year's CCAR (or come very close) based on the new leverage ratios, and notes the lost capital is about equal to the amount of the buyback. At this point, even if BofA passed the CCAR quantitatively, it could fail qualitatively thanks to its accounting processes. Toss in the pending massive litigation settlement with the DOJ (which has come to light post-CCAR).
This will be the first time the Fed has required a bank suspend its capital plan and require a resubmission mid-year, says Ramsden. "In our view this could signal a new level of oversight for banks that wish to continue returning capital when there has been a material change to their risk profile."

The actual net effect on the bank's capital will not be too material, says Wells, but reputational damage, upward pressure on expenses, and the idea of a more conservative capital return request next year could weigh on the stock over the next few months (for an example, see BB&T after the 2013 CCAR).
Wells currently has a Market Perform rating on the stock.

Bank of America (BAC) is 1.1% lower in premarket action after last night's leak of the DOJ seeking more than another $13B out of the hide of shareholders over legacy mortgage issues, according to Bloomberg. The settlement would come on top of the $9.5B agreed to by the bank to resolve FHFA claims, and a deal could come within the next two months, according to sources.
Most of the loans in question became BofA's problem after it purchased Countrywide and Merrill Lynch - one made the punk loans and the other packaged them into MBS.
This deal - which would also resolve state AG charges - would tower over JPMorgan's eye-popper of a $13B settlement from last year, which included $4B for the FHFA.
They're coming for your banks next: There are another eight lenders under investigation by the DOJ and state attorneys general over similar charges.

Net interest income of $10.3B fell 5% Y/Y, with NIM of 2.36% up six basis points. Noninterest income of $12.5B is flat from last year, with lower mortgage banking income and trading profits offset by increases in investment and brokerage income, equity investment income and gains on the sale of debt securities.

The eight affected: BK, BAC, C, GS, JPM, MS, STT, WFC.
The regulators at work were the Fed, the FDIC, and the OCC, and the Fed's Dan Tarullo indicates he wants to go further, signaling the central bank may boost the risk-based capital surcharge to a higher level than the international standard.

Among the banks whose estimates are cut is Bank of America (BAC), now seen earning just $0.02 per share in Q1 from $0.30 previously. For all 2014, EPS should be $0.98, down from $1.06 originally forecast.
Other cuts of note: JPMorgan (JPM) now expected to earn $1.30 in Q1 from $1.36. U.S. Bancorp (USB) at $0.72 vs. $0.75. First Horizon (FHN) $0.13 vs. $0.16, and CVB Financial (CVBF) $0.23 vs. $0.24.
Having its EPS estimate boosted is Wells Fargo (WFC) to $0.94 from $0.90.

 Regulators are due to vote today on whether to increase the "leverage ratio" for the eight largest U.S. banks to 5-6% of their total assets. The Basel III standard is 3%. The move would force banks to add tens of billions of dollars in loss-absorbing capital, although many firms have already been bulking up in anticipation of the rule change. Meanwhile, the Fed has given banks two extra years - until July 2017 - to ensure that their collateralized loan obligations (CLO) comply with the Volcker rule's restrictions on speculative investments. The extension is a reaction banks' fears that selling their CLOs would lead to substantial losses. Relevant tickers: JPM, C, BAC, WFC, GS, MS, BK, STT, ZION

"Mixed economic data, geopolitical volatility, and uncertainty surrounding Fed policy actions have weighed on capital markets revenues, with declines exceeding levels indicated by public proxies," says analyst Steven Chubak, cutting his estimates on the TBTFs ahead of Q1 earnings season.
"We anticipate the greatest cuts at the banks with heavier gearing to capital markets (e.g. GS), though none of the Universals are immune; we expect further downgrades across the group. 2014 consensus reflects a level of optimism not supported by recent company guidance or by trends evident in public proxies."

Absent reforms, another financial crisis is likely to leave taxpayers on the hook for hundreds of billions, warns the IMF, estimating the world's biggest banks receive up to $590B in implicit public subsidies because of their TBTF status.
Said subsidies include bankers who still have a "heads I win, tails you lose" attitude, and investors who lend at lower cost to banks than they might otherwise. The IMF calculated the size of the subsidies by comparing the CDS prices and credit ratings across larger and smaller banks. While the amount has fallen since the crisis, it still remains sizable. "All in all ... the expected probability that systemically important banks will be bailed out remains high in all regions."
Subsidies for the biggest players are "like insurance for which banks don't need to pay a premium," says senior IMF analyst Gaston Gelos.

Count Credit Suisse's Moshe Orenbuch as surprised about the Fed's denial of Citigroup's (C -0.5%) capital return plan. Maybe Citi is just too tough for regulators to get their arms around as it is the most complicated of all the bank holding companies.
Included in the Credit Suisse report is this handy chart of dividends, buybacks, and payout ratios for all of the CCAR banks for 2013 and 2014. Things are loosening up - the median payout ratio (includes dividends and buybacks) this year of 71% compares to 59% in 2013. The dividend payout ratio rises to 26% from 23%.
It helps to be smaller - among the TBTFs, Citi's payout ratio is just 8%, BofA (BAC) 37%, JPMorgan (JPM) 56%, Morgan Stanley (MS) 41%. Wells Fargo is above the median though, being allowed a payout of 79%.
The regionals (KRE), trust banks, and credit card companies - for the most part - were all allowed payout ratios above the median.
The strongest capital returns vs. CS's expectations are those for BNY Mellon (BK), Capital One (COF), KeyCorp (KEY), Huntington Bancshares (HBAN), PNC Financial, and Wells Fargo.

Filed last summer, the lawsuit alleges Bank of America (BAC) made misstatements about mortgages sown up in $850M of MBS in 2008, but Judge David Cayer recommends it be tossed for two technical reasons, notably that the government doesn't demonstrate the alleged misstatements were material to the GSE's decision to buy the paper.

Mar. 28, 2014, 7:11 AM|Mar. 27, 2014, 8:36 AM|Investors ratchet down bank capital return outlook


It's a slow grind for bank capital returns (at least those subject to the CCAR), notes Goldman' Richard Ramsden, with payout ratios boosted just four percentage points to 62% this year. There are clear winners, he says: The credit card companies led by AXP and COF and the trust banks led by BK. Regional banks (KRE) boosted returns but generally fell short of expectations (with HBAN and PNC being the exceptions). Worst-performing were the TBTFs, though JPM and WFC were positives.
"CCAR highlighted the challenges large-caps have in returning excess capital," he says, with Citigroup's (C) failure a reminder the process is unpredictable. With all that excess capital remaining on the balance sheet, Ciit's 2015 goal of a 10% ROTCE appears unlikely to be met.
For Bank of America (BAC), it's resubmission - a better outcome than outright failure - reminds that even well-capitalized banks are "bound by stressed capital and could have trouble returning outsized capital."

Capital return estimates for Bank of America (BAC -0.3%) look a "tad" too high, says Citi's Keith Horowitz, following BofA's getting just a passing grade from the Fed's stress test - its Tier 1 common equity ratio of 5.9% (corrected from the original 6%) under the Fed's adverse economic scenario was the lowest among the 29 of 30 banks which passed.
Horowitz previously estimated BofA would go for a $5B buyback and a $0.03 boost to its dividend (currently just $0.01), but he's thinking a slightly dialed-back repurchase plan may be in order.
Investors will find out after the bell on Wednesday just how close the bank has decided to cut it. Nevertheless, Horowitz would buy any dip should the capital return announcement prove disappointing.

The stress test, says analyst Richard Staite, shows BofA with a $13B buffer over the minimum requirement, meaning maybe just $5B in buybacks and $2.5B dividends this year, "although we are somewhat nervous that it or another bank could be failed on a qualitative basis."
Still, Staite expects a boost in the quarterly payout to $0.06 per share from a penny.
Staite and team upgrade U.S. Bancorp (USB +0.7%) and Wells Fargo (WFC -0.4%) to Neutral from Underweight, citing the large margins by which they passed the stress test.

It's a sluggish day for the TBTFs after yesterday's post-close stress test results. Satiated investors may be selling the news, or perhaps the lenders didn't pass with enough flying colors.
Credit Suisse's Moshe Orenbuch's team had estimated a Tier 1 common ratio under the severely adverse scenario of 8.6% for Bank of America (BAC -1.5%), but it came in at just 6% from the Fed - only 100 basis points higher than the minimum. Citigroup (C -0.1%) - estimated at 10% - came in at 7%, JPMorgan (JPM +0.4%) - estimated at 6.5% - came in at 6.3%.
Morgan Stanley (MS -0.5%), meanwhile, missed CS's estimate by a whopping 400 basis points, while Goldman missed by 170. "Not surprisingly, the capital markets sensitive banks appear on the lower end of the range given losses associated with a large counterparty default, in addition to higher trading losses vs. regional bank peers," says Orenbuch.
Jefferies' Ken Usdin says the lower numbers confirm the "teeth" of the stress tests. "Our initial take is that discrepancies were largely driven by higher charge-off and balance sheet growth assumptions used by the Fed."

Half a million doesn't buy much anymore. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R, Mich.) - a sizable recipient of Wall Street donations - has the large financial institutions displeased with his proposal to levy a tax on them. He says they deserve to pay up for the lower borrowing costs they receive because of their perceived government backstop, a notion the banks dispute.
The proposal is part of larger tax reform expected to get serious discussion after the mid-term elections, and a Camp spokeswoman says the overall plan will make banks "some of the biggest winners."
In discussions to hold a fundraiser for the NRC, Goldman Sachs (GS +0.9%) reportedly opted out over its concerns. Smaller bankers join in with their much larger brethren: "We're going to beat this like a rented mule," says Cam Fine, who heads the Independent Community Bankers Association. "This is a united effort."
Camp's tax would apply to financial firms with assets greater than $500B, levying a 0.035% tax on total assets each year. Among those affected (in addition to Goldman) are AIG, BAC, C, GE Capital, JPM MET, MS, PRU, and WFC. The largest could pay more than $2B per year under the plan.

It's latest effort to try and wring revenue from its most basic banking product (and a loss leader), Bank of America (BAC +0.9%) today begins offering "Safe Balance" - a checkless account for customers with low balances for a monthly fee of $4.95. The account won't allow overdrafts, so it could make sense for those depositors whose balances sometimes fall to zero, causing them to get stuck with overdraft fees.
This effort looks to be a little more well-prepared than previous efforts in 2011 and 2012 which drew swift regulatory and customer blowback and were quickly withdrawn.

Word is the tests are tougher this year, but bank capital levels are also improved.

Under the new terms - which require shareholder approval - Bank of America (BAC) is prohibited from redeeming the $2.9B in preferred stock issued to Berkshire (BRK.A, BRK.B) for five years and the stock will continue to pay a 6% dividend. The dividends, however, will no longer be cumulative, meaning the bank won't be penalized if forced to skip a payment.
In exchange, BofA will be able to count the $2.9B as Tier 1 capital - a good deal for the bank which faces ever-more-stringent capital requirements.
Buffett originally invested $5B in BofA in 2011, acquiring the preferred stock along with warrants struck at $7.14 and expiring in 2021 allowing the purchase of 700M shares - thus far a home run.

 Bank of America (BAC) has disputed government claims that the company should pay $2.1B after the firm and one of its employees was found guilty in October of fraud over defective mortgages sold by the firm's Countrywide unit. Bank of America argues it should only have to pay the amount that it generated in profit from selling the loans, which it says was nothing.

Also, government authorities in North America, Europe and Asia are conducting probes and launching inquiries into BAC's conduct and practices in certain foreign exchange markets over multiple years.

With bank capital levels really no longer in question, don't expect any big pops in the banks surrounding the stress tests and CCAR results, says Citi in its "2014 CCAR Playbook." If anything - given that the stress tests are supposedly tougher this year - the risk to banks could be on the downside.
The team expects the stress test results - which looks at bank balance sheets under different scenarios - sometime around March 7 and the CCAR results - on which the Fed approves/disapproves capital return plans - about a week later.
Look for modestly higher average gross payout ratios of 62% vs. 55% last year. Individual banks: BAC 11% dividend (payout ratio) + 32% buyback for 43%; BBT 33% dividend +19% buyback; FITB 32% dividend + 37% buyback; JPM 27% dividend + 18% buyback; WFC 28% dividend + 43% buyback; GS 14% dividend + 78% buyback for an industry-leading payout ratio of 91%; MTB 34% dividend + 0% buyback; MS 17% dividend + 36% buyback; PNC 31% dividend + 49% buyback; USB 30% dividend +46% buyback.

Expecting dividends to grow 49% on average for the banks subject to the Fed's stress tests (about the same as last year), Markit, says Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) will lead the way with 400% boosts. "They are the last of the major banks paying minimal dividends ... change is overdue."
While 400% is a big number, Citi and BofA will continue to lag their peers in terms of yield (400% growth on a penny just leads to a nickel).
Also expected to have a significant pop is Morgan Stanley (MS) - a doubling of the payout to $0.10 per share and a 1.4% yield. Others in the top 5 in increases are Zions Bancorp (ZION) with a 75% boost to $0.07 and Regions Financial (RF) up 67% to $0.05.

As for ETFs, the dividend jumps are expected to have the biggest impact on the XLF which would see a 25% increase in payout: The ETF has 81 companies, but the top 5 holdings - BofA, Wells, JPM, Citi, USB - make up 41% of assets. In contrast, just two CCAR banks make up the top five holdings of the KBE and it should see a more muted increase of just 18%.

The Bank of America (BAC +0.6%) board approved $14M for CEO Brian Moynihan, according a regulatory filing. Of that, $1.5M was his regular salary and $12.5M was stock grants, but there was no bonus despite a big move in the stock and profits that rose to $11.4B from $4.2B in 2012. The $1.5M salary will remain unchanged this year.
"They didn’t give him an outrageous raise,” says an executive search exec. “They’re also looking at how the outside world views this, and so they were relatively conservative.” Perhaps Moynihan should angle for the Chairman's slot. JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon - both CEO and Chairman of the Board - got a 74% raise for his 2013 efforts.

Lawyers for investors who support the settlement like BlackRock and MetLife sent a letter to the new judge reminding the dissidents own just 7% of the securities in question and are holding "the entire settlement hostage indefinitely."

However, Schneiderman will still pursue the lawsuit and seek an injunction that would ban former BofA CEO Kenneth Lewis and ex-CFO Joe Price from the securities industry and from being directors of public companies. Schneiderman has accused BofA of misleading shareholders over the scale of losses at Merrill and bonus payouts in order to win authorization for the deal, and of manipulating the federal government to provide bailout loans. In 2012, BofA agreed to pay stockholders $2.43B to settle a lawsuit over losses they made because of the Merrill Lynch transaction.  

Jan. 19, 2014, 1:01 AM|Jan. 17, 2014, 12:55 PM|Banks stay mum on litigation reserves


Notably not disclosing its litigation reserve this quarter was JPMorgan (JPM -0.2%), which had taken the unusual step of doing so last October (it was $23B) ahead of the major DOJ settlement.
Even as litigation has become of such material import to banks, the lenders generally don't disclose how much they've set aside for settlements and fines. The reason is clear: Whatever number that may be becomes a target for opposing attorneys.
“I definitely feel that the disclosures around this aren’t great ... I thought JPMorgan disclosing it was going to put pressure on more banks to start doing it,” says Goldman's Richard Ramsden. Most don't believe banks are sitting on catastrophically low reserves (BAC has paid in about $50B to its reserve since the financial crisis, says Bernstein), and the number can often be pieced together, but it's hard to know sometimes what banks have drawn down to settle cases.
While the SEC has asked lenders to offer better disclosure on things like European bond holdings, it has requested nothing on litigation reserves, though they're causing more financial pain than Europe is.

Noninterest income of $10.7B, up 28% Y/Y, thanks to lower provisions for reps and warranties, and improvement in investment banking and brokerage income (global wealth management income of $777M, up 35%). Credit loss provisions of $336M are $1.9B lower than a year ago. Net charge offs of $1.6B in the Q compare to $3.1B a year ago.
Expense cutting remains on track: Noninterest expense of $17.3B is down 6% Y/Y, thanks to job cuts in Legacy Assets and Servicing (LAS). Full-time equivalent employees fall 9% in 2013 to 242K. This was offset by litigation expenses rising to $2.3B in Q4 from $1.1B in Q3 and $916M a year ago.
Like with Wells Fargo and JPMorgan, mortgage business continues to disappear, with first-mortgage originations falling 46% Y/Y and core production revenue falling to $403M from $986M. The difference - at least as far as with Wells Fargo - is the mortgage business makes up for a far smaller chunk of BAC's business.

"Multi-year capital/cost initiatives have prepared Bank of America (BAC) for a tougher capital regime, and its strong position supports meaningfully higher payouts vs. peers, in our view," says analyst Steven Chubak, initiating coverage with a Buy and $19 price target.
"BAC's current business mix, improving efficiency, and higher rate sensitivity should support ~15% mid-cycle returns (on required capital) by 2016. Legal costs should remain elevated, but analysis suggests BAC is only moderately under-reserved for remaining Private Label exposure. Long-term ROE potential of ~15% supports PT of $19, or 14% potential upside."
"We see unparalleled ROE potential at Citigroup (C) under the new capital rules, as Citicorp efficiency targets are realized by 2015 and Citi Holdings turns profitable," he says, starting the bank at a Buy with $70 price target.
"We also see significant excess capital generation/best-in-class payout potential as the drag from Holdings moderates and DTA utilization accelerates. The above trends support through-the-cycle ROE potential of 15% and payout ratios >100%, which are not properly reflected in the shares, in our view."

In 2007, the figure was 38.4% and in 1990 it was just 9.67%. The banking operations of JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC) and U.S. Bancorp (USB) held $6.46T in assets as of Q3 2013.

The central bank could project that bank assets would grow during a slump, as has happened in the past three recessions, rather than fall, as the banks have predicted.
With such a finding, the Fed could require banks to hold more loss-absorbing capital or limit shareholder payouts. (Fed letter)

 A panoply of regulators are due to disclose the details of the Volcker rule this morning and then formally adopt the measures later in the day. The new regulations will ban banks from proprietary trading, and prevent them from owning over 3% of hedge funds and private-equity funds. Banks fear that the rules could cost them billions of dollars by making it more difficult to engage in activities that are permitted under the regulation, such as market-making, underwriting and hedging against risks. Expect the lawyers to go through the proposals to see what could be struck down in court.

 District Court judge Mariana Pfaelzer has approved a $500M class-action settlement between Bank of America (BAC) and pension funds related to problematic mortgage bonds sold by Countrywide from 2004-7. BofA said that following the deal, the bank will have resolved up to 75% of its exposure to MBS claims resulting from its purchase of Countrywide in 2008. Judge Pfaelzer authorized the deal over the objections of the FDIC. The agreement follows a $404M settlement that BofA struck with Freddie Mac over mortgage-repurchase claims, which was announced on Monday last week.  

Dec. 8, 2013, 4:35 AM|Dec. 5, 2013, 12:01 PM|Blow to banks' hedging in Volcker Rule


The Too Big To Fail banks lead to the downside amid a report the set-to-be-voted on Volcker rule will not contain language allowing portfolio hedging - trades supposedly designed to protect against losses in a broad portfolio of assets.
Banks can thank JPMorgan's (JPM -1.7%) London Whale fiasco for this as the Whale's trades were ostensibly set up for this portfolio hedging, but ended up costing the bank $6B.
The move is a big blow to the banks which had sent their big lobbying guns in to try and prevent the disallowing of this practice. Banks often hedge to offset risks from trading with clients, but often there is no great hedge, and this is where portfolio hedging comes in ... or used to.
"Volcker has morphed a bit, thanks to the Whale," says UBS' Brennan Hawken. "Now a big component of it has become about hedging. What can you hedge, and what can't you? It's really unclear." The CFTC and SEC are each set to vote on the rule on Dec. 10.

 The Department of Justice intends to bring cases against several financial institutions next year for what it says is mortgage-bond fraud, Attorney General Eric Holder told Reuters yesterday. While Holder said that the DOJ would use JPMorgan's $13B agreement as a template, he didn't provide details about which banks are in his crosshairs. Firms that have acknowledged that they are under investigation include Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS).  

Dec. 5, 2013, 4:44 AM|Dec. 4, 2013, 10:48 AM|Banks cited for non-compliance with mortgage settlement


Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C -1.3%), and JPMorgan (JPM +0.5%) each failed at least 2 of 29 metrics used to gauge compliance with the national $25B mortgage settlement, according to a court filing from Joseph Smith, the watchdog overseeing the process. The last report - filed in June - cited JPM, Citi, and Wells Fargo for missing on 3 metrics.
The failures stem from the complexity of the banks' systems, says Smith, and fixes can be expensive, but all the banks have implemented plans to address to issues.
In one example, BofA failed on one test as to whether loans were actually delinquent at the time foreclosure was initiated, and another about how quickly it was notifying borrowers of missing documents in their loan modification applications.
 

Dec. 4, 2013, 10:48 AM|Dec. 3, 2013, 3:50 PM|Banks about to get clarity on prop trading


The CFTC sets a December 10 vote on the so-called Volcker rule which is supposed to ban banks from prop trading. It sounded so simple when politicians trumpeted it in 2010, but the reality of what banks do is slightly more complex and the text of the rule has mushroomed to 1K pages. GS, MS, JPM, BAC, and C, among others, will be eager to see what the regulations entail.
Any hopes for a watering-down of the rule likely ended with JPMorgan's $6B London Whale loss.
The SEC indicates it will act on the rule around the same time as the CFTC (3 other agencies must approve as well).

Dec. 3, 2013, 3:50 PM|Dec. 3, 2013, 11:13 AM|Banks expect to make mortgages outside of new standard


The nation's largest retail banks - WFC, BAC, C, and JPM - all expect to originate mortgages beginning in January falling outside of the standards mandated by Washington. To review, Dodd-Frank doesn't prohibit mortgages not meeting the definition of a so-called qualified mortgage (as defined by the CFPB), but banks can face greater legal liability on those loans.
The impact of the new rules has yet to be seen, but the worry is they would curtail lending at the exact time when it ought to be encouraged. At this point, the bank's lending outside of these standards looks like it will be mostly to affluent customers (jumbo mortgages), and not a large proportion of total activity. Wells estimates about 5% of its lending this year wouldn't fall within QM guidelines.
Wells' EVP of home mortgages Brad Blackwell: "It's clear the borrowers we're lending to today have an ability to repay ... We don't see a significant reason to contract our lending...because these are very high-quality borrowers."
Deutsche estimates 13% of jumbo loans made since 2010 wouldn't be "qualified" mortgages.

Any payment made by BofA is fully covered by the bank's existing reserves. With this deal, says the bank, BofA has resolved all outstanding potential rep and warranty claims by the GSEs on loans sold by both it and Countrywide from 2000-2009.

Dec. 2, 2013, 8:00 AM|Nov. 27, 2013, 9:22 AM|Additional legal tab for banks could exceed $100B


"Mortgage-related litigation has recently gotten a second wind and has expanded beyond investor claims,” says S&P, now estimating legal tab for U.S. banks could be another $56.5B-$104B. The good news is banks have gotten ahead of even these crazy numbers by boosting litigation reserves to nearly $155B.
The bad news would be if Bank of America's (BAC) $8.5B mortgage settlement with private parties gets tossed out by a federal judge (see Article 77 hearing coverage), the litigation losses could "escalate significantly ...  the ability of US banks with the largest exposures to withstand additional expenses is not unlimited.”

C, WFC, MS, JPM, and GS declined to comment for the story.
From the Department of Legal Issues Are Going Nowhere: The Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh - claiming its losses of more than $1B are not covered by the JPMorgan global settlement - asks a judge to force JPM to turn over the draft complain from the DOJ which includes the name of a bank employee described as a cooperating witness for the government.

It's a milestone of sorts for Bank of America (BAC +2.9%) and its CEO as the stock for the third session in a row trades above the level it was at the day before Brian Moynihan took over on January 1, 2010.
Unlike some other bank bosses (Jamie DImon) Moynihan pursued a strategy of getting lawsuits out of the way and not speaking out against waves of new bank regulations (word is, it's Moynihan, not Dimon, who gets to sit next to the President now at occasional banker/WH get-togethers).
Following Moynihan taking over in 2011, the stock rose to near $20 per share before closing the year closer to $5. Today's close: $15.56.
The TARP warrants (A-series) closed the session up 3.8% at $6.54.

Drexel Hamilton's David Hilder notes Bank of America (BAC +1.5%), Citigroup (C +1.8%), and Morgan Stanley (MS +1.2%) all traded well below tangible book value one year ago, and Raymond James' Anthony Polini thinks the 10-year Treasury yield will have to move above 3% and stay there before you'll begin seeing earnings estimates ratcheted up.
Bank of America hit its highest level in nearly 3 year today and JPMorgan (JPM +1.7%) - for all of its legal troubles - is only about 2% below prices not seen since 2000.

 The Federal Reserve could delay by a year the date by which banks will have to comply with all aspects of the Volcker rule. The target at the moment is July 2014. Regulators are still finalizing the proposal, which, among other things, would ban banks from proprietary trading using their own money. The regulators are unlikely to release the definitive version until December. However, banks would still have to eliminate their pure proprietary trading desks by July next year.
The sector is concerned that the rule will limit activities such as market making and hedging.

 A court is due to begin hearing final arguments today over an agreement in which Bank of America (BAC) would pay investors $8.5B to settle claims that it sold mortgage bonds that didn't meet their promised quality. Those in favor of the deal include BlackRock (BLK), Pacific Investment Management Co (PIMCO) and Goldman Sachs (GS), while those against include AIG (AIG). The latter calls the agreement a "pennies on the dollar" settlement, as it argues that investor losses exceeded $100B.

The credit ratings of these banks have each benefited from the assumption of government support, Moody's says, and its rating actions reflect strengthened U.S. bank resolution  tools, prompted by the Dodd-Frank Act, which affect its assumptions  about U.S. government support.
Ratings for Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), State Street (STT) and Wells Fargo (WFC) are left unchanged.

"Don't confuse brains with a bull market," writes Mike Mayo, reiterating his long-held (relative) bearish stance on Bank of America (BAC) and its leader Brian Moynihan. Yes, the shares have done well, but so has the market, particularly the banks. BofA, says Mayo, has trailed the KBW Bank Index by 5800 basis points since Moynihan took over in 2010.
It's a muddled message, says Mayo, to put slimming-down efforts front and center while also bragging about the size and scope of the bank. One of the areas of retreat - the mortgage business in 2011 - cost the bank billions, he says.
Also at issue is the bank's decision to measure progress using different metrics than previously. “We’ve reviewed several annual reports and presentations and can’t seem to connect the aspirational pie-in-the-sky statements with progress reports ... (it) raises questions about data integrity, consistency and information systems."

The net closing of bank branches continues a mutliquarter trend, according to SNL Financial, which finds a net loss of 390 locations in Q3 as more customers do more routine banking business online, and banks - in a sluggish revenue environment - look to the low-hanging fruit of shuttering underperforming stores. The 390 figure is about inline with Q2, but higher than prior reads.
"There's almost nobody in the branches," says bank consultant Jim Adkins. "You could shoot water balloons all over the place and not hit anybody."
In addition to costs and technology, there's also M&A, and one of the first things to be done after an acquisition is to close overlapping branches.
Leading the way in terms of net closings in Q3 were SunTrust (STI) and Bank of America (BAC). Not getting in the spirit of things is JPMorgan (JPM) which opened more branches than it closed in Q3.

Consumer credit cards, for one, says Moynihan, noting the bank two years ago was doling out about 700K new cards per quarter vs. 1.1M in the most recent quarter - and all of the growth was done through selling to the existing customer base. There are still millions of customers to tap, and then there's the need to boost activity levels - there remains plenty of room to grow.The business owners Moynihan talks to are "cautiously optimistic," and consumers have been spending at a fairly good clip ...

Past precedence suggests the bank may pay more than the amount of the claims in order to prevent any new repurchase demands from materializing. FHFA chief Ed DeMarco has requested the GSEs put to bed these legacy issues by the end of this year.
Bank of America has also had two similar settlements with Fannie Mae.

He reminds the audience BofA has spent more than $40B to date trying to put the legal issues behind it.
As for the economy, Moynihan says he saw no break in consumer spending during the financial crisis. While mortgage business is down at BofA (and the entire banking sector), it's not indicative of a weakening housing market as it's refinancing which has dropped off - purchase originations continue to trend higher.

It's a legal victory for Bank of America (BAC +0.1%) as a federal judge dismisses an investor lawsuit accusing it of concealing a $10B fraud case brought by AIG. The bank was not required to disclose the imminence of the suit because the news wasn't materially different than previously-disclosed information, says the judge, the bank made no inaccurate or incomplete statements, and there was no duty to disclose the information sought.
Of course, BofA's 20% dive on the day in 2011 when AIG sued it over $28B in MBS suggests something materially different occurred.
Whether the $8.5B settlement on that case goes through is at this moment before a judge (the Article 77 hearing is expected to restart next week).
 

Nov. 4, 2013, 3:09 PM|Nov. 4, 2013, 10:56 AM|Banks brace for continued legal issues over mortgages


The legal headaches for the big banks over mortgages only grow after JPMorgan's (JPM -0.1%) $5,1B settlement with the FHFA - 12% of the original purchase amount. "My sense is, the industry is concerned about what’s happened,” says law professor Carl Tobias. “The size of the JPM settlement made people wake up and be more concerned than they were before.”
Fourteen banks still have similar suits pending with the FHFA, but most-exposed is Bank of America (BAC +0.5%). ISI's Glenn Schorr extrapolates the JPMorgan settlement and figures BofA will have to pay $6.8B, well beyond $5.1B in legal reserves (BofA disclosed last week that losses could go beyond this). Goldman (GS +0.1%) and Morgan Stanley (MS +0.3%) would be on the hook for $1.3B each, says Schorr, and Morgan analyst Betsey Graseck cut her estimates for both BofA and Goldman last week.
FHFA holds plenty of sway to get that 12% payout, but private investors have typically only gotten back 2% - looking at the government's fat payout might encourage them to lobby for a boost.
Then there's a new tool for prosecutors - a law called the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, or Firrea - "another arrow in the quiver of prosecutors, and it’s worked," says Tobias. It was central to a loss for BofA last month in a lawsuit over mortgages sold to the GSEs. Among its twists is a 10-year statute of limitations, and BofA discloses the DOJ is employing Firrea in a new suit about a certain 2008 mortgage offering.

The price tag - obscured by a confidentiality agreement - is believed to less than $1B, reports the FT (a far cry from JPM's $5.1B settlement). Wells (WFC -0.4%) was the only large U.S. bank to not be named when the FHFA filed suit against 17 lenders in 2011 - apparently because it had already entered into settlement discussions with the GSE regulator.
In addition to the Bank of Dimon's settlement last week, Ally Financial reports it expects to soon reach a deal, and HSBC boosted reserves - a sign a settlement is nearing.
This ramps up the pressure on holdouts like Bank of America (BAC -0.9%), RBS, Deutsche Bank (DB -0.7%), and Credit Suisse (CS -0.4%) - all of which have large exposure to FHFA cases - to cut their own deals. Extrapolating the JPMorgan settlement leads to a range of payments of $1.7B to $7B for these four lenders, says the FT, which has reported the FHFA is pressing BofA for more than $6B.

Bonuses handed out to brokers amid the financial crisis were a "tax on the industry," says Gorman.
For its part, Merrill lost the fewest number of advisors to competitors in Q3 since the end of 2010. BofA doesn't disclose the compensation ratio for the thundering herd, but said its wealth management margin was a robust 25.6% in Q3 (it hit 27.6% in Q2, the highest since 2007).
A recent regulatory rule backed by Morgan and Merrill may also help: Finra voted to make defecting brokers disclose how much their new employer paid them to leave. Stifel Financial (SF) - with more than 2K brokers - calls the action anti-competitive.

Bank of America (BAC) has a market-leading position in U.S. leveraged finance, but not so in Europe, and senior bankers say the bank is set to commit more capital and staff to change that. It's the only lender to have had a hand in the three largest European M&A deals this year - Virgin Media, DE Masters Blenders, and Ista - and the bank has risen from 13th in the ranking to 4th so far in 2013.Barclays (BCS) last week indicated its ambition to move up from its current 11th place in the rankings.

 The Federal Housing Finance Agency reportedly wants Bank of America (BAC) to pay at least $6B to settle accusations that it sold faulty mortgage bonds to Fannie Mae (FNMA.OB) and Freddie Mac (FMCC.OB) The amount is well above the $4B that JPMorgan has apparently agreed to pay to settle similar claims, as well as the $885M fine that UBS accepted. The penalties are part of a lawsuit against 17 banks that the FHFA filed two years ago.

Seeing credit costs remaining lower for longer and more confidence about expense savings falling to the bottom line, analyst Andrew Marquardt lifts his EPS estimates and price target on Buy-rated Bank of America (BAC) following yesterday's earnings.
2013 EPS is lifted to $1 from $0.91, 2014 to $1.36 from $1.30, 2015 to $1.63 from $1.52. The price target is raised to $17 from $16.
Pressed on cost savings by Mike Mayo during the CC yesterday (transcript), CFO Bruce Thompson confirmed the bank has already achieved about $1.4B of $2B of quarterly expense cuts promised by management (by mid-2015). Thompson also confirmed his expectation for this number to directly boost the bottom line.
 

Oct. 17, 2013, 8:37 AM|Oct. 16, 2013, 8:54 AM|BofA management: Improving credit trends about to flatten out


Bank of America (BAC) repurchased 60M shares in Q3, bringing repurchases YTD to 140M shares, or $1.9B (vs. the $5B authorized by the Fed through 2014 Q1), says CEO Moynihan on the earnings call now playing live on Seeking Alpha (presentation slides).
Net interest income excluding market-related impacts hasn't really budged from about $10.5B during any quarter over the last year. The bank continues to be "asset sensitive" and thus poised for NII to move higher along with interest rates. Excluding market-related impact, net interest yield rose to 2.44% from 2.36% last quarter.
While expenses fell $1.1B from last year, they ticked $400M higher in Q2 as the bank - glancing at neighbor JPMorgan - boosted litigation reserves by $500M. Full-time-equivalent employees fell to 247.9K from 272.6K.
The tailwind from improving credit is about the stop: Net charge-offs - which fell to $1.7B in Q3 from $2.1B in Q2 and $4.1B a year ago - are expected to fall again in Q4 before stabilizing in 2014 to a run rate of about $1.5B per quarter, says CFO Bruce Thompson.
As expected, FICC revenue fell a sharp 20%, or $501M to $2B in Q3, but market share gains and improved volume had equity revenue 36% higher, or $255M to $1B.
Higher earlier, shares are now flat premarket.

Net interest income of $10.5B vs. $10.2B a year ago. Noninterest income of $11.3B is up from $10.5B. Total revenue of $21.7B compares to $20.6B last year. Provision for credit losses drops to $296M from $1.8B a year ago.
Net interest margin of 2.44% is up 12 basis points from last year's Q3.
Noninterest expense of $16.4B is down from $17.5B a year ago - a comination of lower litigation expense, continued cutbacks on Legacy Assets and Servicing (LAS), and the bank's general continued trimming of expenses (i.e. headcount).
Mortgage slowdown: Consumer real estate services revenue of $1.6B compares to $2.1B in Q2, $3.1B a year ago.
Other consumer highlights: Mobile banking customers up 26% to 14M (lower costs moving forward), consumer credit card loss rate of 3.47% is lowest since Q1 2006.

Evercore's Andrew Marquardt gets on board the rush to cut bank estimates ahead of Q3 earnings reports this month, tweaking down expected Bank of America (BAC) core EPS to $0.23, still ahead of Street consensus $0.20, but below $0.25 in Q2. On a reported basis, Marquardt expects a $0.15 print.
The reasons aren't news - slow mortgage and capital markets activity, though expense reductions should offset somewhat.
Full year core EPS estimate is now $0.91 from $0.96. 2014 is $1.30 from $1.31. 2015 is unchanged at $1.52.

The use of sub-servicing arrangements and outright sales of mortgage servicing rights have helped Bank of America (BAC +1%) cut its loan servicing portfolio by nearly 50% since 2010, according to Moody's.
The moves mean a significantly smaller delinquent loan portfolio as BofA specifically targeted millions of its loans as high-risk, and chose those for sale or sub-servicing. They also mean major expense cuts thanks to less staff, fewer vendors, and fewer offices.
It also has meant riches for the buyers of these MSRs such as Ocwen (OCN), Nationstar (NSM), and Walter Investment Management (WAC).
"Bank of America has executed on its strategy thus far, and if it continues its efforts, will no longer be a major servicer of delinquent loans," says Moody's Gene Berman.

 Analysts have cut their earnings estimates for the top five U.S. banks by over $1B in total, due to increasing fears about a sharp fall in trading revenue - especially from fixed-income operations - and higher legal costs. JPMorgan (JPM) has been particularly affected, with consensus for net income down $526M to below $5B. The company's legal woes are seen adding $2B to expenses. Analysts have lowered their net income for Bank of America (BAC) by $128M, for Goldman Sachs (GS) by $123M, for Morgan Stanley (MS) by $97M, and for Citigroup (C) by $210M. The latter has already reportedly told investors about a sharp drop in trading revenues. Banks had hoped a big September would help offset a slow summer, but that hasn't happened.

'Morgan Stanley, Morgan Stanley, and Morgan Stanley" are Mike Mayo's top 3 picks among the banks. MS is double over the last year and it's a double again over the next three, he says.Of the dip in trading revenue report from Citi which hit the banks yesterday, Mayo says it's old news - fixed income trading has been going down for years and a continued fall is already in Mayo's models. Any revisions lower are little more than "noise," and will be a blip on the screen a few months from now. Morgan Stanley gets just 15% of revenue from fixed-income trading - sluggishness in this area is no excuse not to own the stock, says Mayo."Revenues stink in the banking industry," he allows, and that's why he likes Morgan Stanley (and Citigroup C as well) - "the restructuring story can cut through the revenue weakness."What about Bank of America (BAC) which has moved nearly tick for tick with Morgan Stanley this year? Morgan has more levers, says Mayo, particularly in Wealth Management after its purchase of Smith Barney from Citigroup.

 Citigroup (C) slips 1% in the premarket after its weekend "pre-announcement" of a big fall in FICC revenue in Q3. The bank had been hoping to get bailed out by a big September, but the Fed's non-taper last week squelched the chance of major portfolio moves by clients. Anybody paying attention surely noticed last week's evaporation of profit at Jefferies (now owned by Leucadia) as fixed-income trading revenue essentially disappeared. Deutshce Bank (DB) is expected to soon be out with a warning similar to Citibank's. Barclays (BCS) and Credit Suisse (CS) have already waved their own red flags over this issue.

Cost savings, reserve releases, and a strong capital markets business leave the bank "uniquely placed" for sustained outperformance.
Also started at Buy is Citigroup (C -0.6%) as rising home prices could boost Citi Holdings - the unit into which the bank's legacy assets have been placed. Better earnings should also allow the recapture of Citi's $45B deferred tax asset. He sees 2015 adjusted EPS of $6.31 vs. $4.93 this year.
JPMorgan (JPM +0.7%) is started at Hold because of the regulatory target on its back, with 2015 EPS expected to rise to just $6.25 in 2015 from $5.88 this year.
Wells Fargo (WFC -0.6%) also rates just a hold because of the bank's heavy exposure to the slowing mortgage market.

"Basically we love the position of being an owner," says Buffett of the 10-year warrants Berkshire (BRK.A, BRK.B) received when it purchased a $5B preferred stake in Bank of America (BAC) in 2011. The warrants are struck at $7.14 each and allow the purchase of 700M shares of BofA common up to the year 2021 (last night's close was $14.61; bravo, Mr. Buffett).
Buffett expects to hold the warrants until near-expiration and then convert them to common stock, though that calculation could change were the bank to institute a significant dividend.
On redeeming Buffett's preferred stake, BofA CEO Moynihan says the bank has more expensive capital to retire first. "There will be some day that we’ll talk about this, but that’s far out there."

Bank of America's (BAC +0.3%) Article 77 hearing resumed this week at which a NY State Supreme Court judge will or won't approve the bank's $8.5B MBS settlement with investors like Goldman, BlackRock, and Pimco. To review: The objectors - led by AIG - contend the amount is far too small and the trustee assigned to guard bondholder interests - BNY Mellon (BK) - was horribly conflicted due to business ties with BofA.
In what CLSA Mike Mayo describes as the most explosive action thus far, AIG's attorneys tried to establish Brian Lin of little-known RRMS Advisors (he was hired by BK to write a report on the reasonableness of the $8.5B deal) was no more than a rubber-stamp for the cheap settlement. The judge eventually had to step in and cut off questioning.
Mayo maintains his sell rating on BAC, believing Street consensus of a 1-in-20 chance of the settlement being throw out is too small. Should the judge actually vacate the settlement, the bank faces another $16B-$22B in legal damages, he says.

"Our balance sheet remains asset sensitive," says Bank of America (BAC -0.1%) CFO Bruce Thompson, presenting (webcast) (presentation slides) at the Barclays conference. Like other bank managements, Thompson is making the case for higher profits as interest rates rise. According to the bank's models, a 100 bp steepening of the yield curve would add $1B to net interest income over the next year (NII was $10.4B in Q2). A 100 bp parallel rise in rates would add $3.3B.
The bank is ahead of plan (previously tipped) on reducing legacy mortgage servicing costs, expecting LAS expense excluding litigation to fall below $2B by Q4, below $1B in 2014Q1. The target is a $500M run rate by mid-2015.

Notably not included in this morning's new additions to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were Apple and Google. "We had to think about it, but the arithmetic doesn't work," S&P's David Blitzer tells CNBC. Blitzer hints of a possible change coming to the Dow weighting scheme.
The DJIA is currently price-weighted, meaning the share price is more important to a company's weight in the index rather than market cap. A back-of-the-envelope calculation finds Apple would be about 30% of the Dow were it added!
Indeed an S&P Dow Jones statement says the low share price of Alcoa (AA), Bank of America (BAC), and H-P (HPQ) was a key reason for their removal.
The real-money impact on those removed and added (GS, NKE, V) won't be huge as a relatively small amount of money is indexed to the DJIA. The DIA has about $12B in AUM vs. the SPY with $136B.

The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index increased 5.95% to 5.16 in August as markets stumbled, meaning clients continued their pattern of selling the rips and buying the dips - the index previously fell in July as stocks rallied.
There was no contrarian action in Tesla (TSLA), where clients continued to buy as it gained for the month. Dip-buying was notable, however, in a number of basic material companies, including BP, Kinder Morgan (KMP), and Potash (POT).
Clients were net sellers in financial names like Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS), and they faded rallies in Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB). Other popular names sold included Chesapeake Energy (CHK), Merck (MRK), and Qualcomm (QCOM).

Turning to two of his other big investments, Berkowitz says Bank of America (BAC +0.7%) is going to look like Wells Fargo in a few years and CEO Moynihan is a genius. A bank analyst in the early 90s, Berkowitz made his bones touting the value in Wells Fargo when most thought it was going to collapse under the weight of the California housing bust. On AIG, Berkowitz says book value is currently about $60 per share (price now is $48).

Worst-case estimates of legal losses stemming from pre-crisis mortgage sales at the three largest U.S. banks "are clearly manageable," says Drexel Hamilton's David Hilder. His conclusion comes after studying "reasonably possible losses" in the Q2 filings of BAC, C, JPM, and WFC.
"Initial estimates of mortgage-related losses and litigation settlement costs were too low ... at this point, more than 5 years since the mortgage-driven parts of the crisis began to explode ... we believe the banks' estimates ... are likely to be more accurate than externally-derived estimates."
Hilder's view is the consensus one, but (surprise) CLSA's Mike Mayo says Bank of American faces billions more in potential losses owing to the challenge to its $8.5B settlement to resolve $107B in investor losses. The Article 77 hearing over that matter resumes on September 9 following a summer recess.

Verizon intends to help pay for the deal with $49B in bonds and $14B in other debt, but might need the bridge loan if it can't issue the bonds by the time the transaction closes, which is expected in Q1 2014. The $63B in funding will replace the bridge loan. JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America (BAC) and Barclays (BCS) are leading the financing and underwriting the deal.

Maybe a victory for prospective homeowners, but certainly a victory for anyone dependent upon a speedy housing market, the new proposal for the Qualified Residential Mortgage rule (QRM) is quite a bit less-restrictive than the original version.
The new standard would allow a no downpayment option similar to that allowed by the CFPB - that rule protects banks from being sued by mortgage investors on zero-down loans as long as the borrower's debt to income ratio is less than 43%.
The new plan also requires banks to hold onto a slice of mortgages (for those with less than 20% down) when debt/income is above 43% as opposed to 36% in the initial proposal.
The agencies will await public comment before a vote on the final rule.
Homebuilders, mortgage bankers, and realtors look on with interest.

 The U.S.'s six largest banks have accumulated legal costs of $103B so far since the financial crisis, Bloomberg calculates, noting that the figure is greater than the amount they've paid in dividends in the past five years. Legal fees and litigation costs account for $56B and the rest is for payments to mortgage investors. JPMorgan's (JPM) legal bill is $21.3B while it has allocated $8.1B for mortgage buybacks.

UBS last month agreed to a precedent-setting $885M settlement, or more than 90% of expected losses on MBS it packaged. The notional value of paper sold by JPMorgan (JPM) is 5x larger than that of UBS, leading to a figure close to the $6B range. JPMorgan - negotiating for a lower amount - says claims against other banks allege fraud, making their offenses more serious.
$6B would be the high-end of what JPMorgan last year figured was its liability in the case (the suit is over $33B in MBS). The House of Dimon could await its day in court, but nearly all initial rulings have gone against the banks thus far. A settlement before the summer 2014 trial date still looks probable.
Watching closely will be Bank of America (BAC) and RBS, both of which have heavy exposure to the FHFA suits and have yet to settle. Morgan Stanley estimates a worst-case scenario of $3.6B for BofA vs. a base case of $2B.

Wow. Bank of America's (BAC +0.4%) Legacy Asset Servicing costs are expected to drop to a normalized run rate of $500M per quarter by the end of 2015, says KBW's Chris Mutascio after a meeting with the bank's CFO Bruce Thompson. This compares to $2.3B in Q2 of this year. Annually, this is $7.2B in savings over the next 2 years and beyond (mostly by way of layoffs as the beefed-up staff hired to deal with non-performing mortgages is cut).
For this year, management now expects LAS costs to fall to $2B in Q4. This is below the $2.1B guidance given during the Q2 earnings call (transcript).
Mutascio doesn't have an EPS estimate beyond 2014 ($1.38), but the LAS savings represent a $0.17-$0.25 benefit, he says. He currently rates the shares a Hold with $15 price target.

Brazil's nascent municipal bond market is brought to a standstill as the government is unhappy with big profits collected by Credit Suisse (CS) and Bank of America (BAC) for underwriting deals.

The government wants a piece of that action and is considering banning the securitization of new loans and a cap on interest rates.

 Blackstone (BX) has reportedly hired a number of banks to lead an IPO of Hilton Worldwide, which the private-equity firm took private in 2007 in a $26.7B leveraged buyout,  one of the largest before the financial crisis.

The banks involved - which are so far Deutsche Bank (DB), Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) - are expected to help Hilton refinance $13B in debt. The speculation comes as a rebound in demand for hotel rooms and not enough supply has led to a boom in the hotel sector. Hilton's pro forma EBITDA rose 17% in H1; 2013 EBITDA is forecast to be 58% higher than in 2009. The speculation also follows reports yesterday that Blackstone is looking to exit La Quinta Inns & Suites, a budget hotel chain.

"Like a fat kid in dodgeball, these need to stay on the sidelines," wrote another. The bank portrayed these as prime loans vetted by underwriting when, in fact, they were wholesale mortgages - originated by outside brokers - according to Justice. As of June, at least 23% of the mortgages in the pool had defaulted or were delinquent, leading to $70M in losses thus far, with maybe another $50M to come, estimates Fitch.

A Merrill spokesperson notes while some clients will see higher costs, others will see a decrease, and room for negotiation will remain.The increases come amid a platform overhaul designed to make it easier for advisers to build portfolios and manage accounts.

Distinguishing Citi from its peers is 58% of revenue coming internationally vs. JPM and BAC in the teens - a big edge with U.S. growth crimped by regulations and the economy. In the nearer term, shareholders should enjoy massive capital returns as toxic paper at Citi Holdings is wound down (CH has 8% of bank assets, but ties up 20% of capital), and growing profits allow the use of Citi's $55B in tax deferred assets.

He sees Goldman reporting EPS of $2.70, down from $3.10 previously and against consensus of $2.83. Morgan is cut to $0.42 vs. consensus of $0.45. JPMorgan (JPM) might still surprise to the upside thanks to a boost from lower mortgage loss reserves.

Jun. 26, 2013, 9:09 AM|Jun. 26, 2013, 3:54 AM|Falling bond prices and rising yields are threatening the recovery in the balance sheets of global banks, which have built up huge portfolios of liquid securities to comply with regulatory requirements and due to a lack of better investments. For example, 90% of Bank of America's (BAC) $315B portfolio comprises mortgage bonds and Treasurys. Some analysts, though, believe that QE tapering should increase interest margins and offset the one-time hit to book values because of rising bond yields.

Next up is BofA (BAC) which has already settled with Assured and MBIA (MBI), but is still tussling with Ambac (AMBC). Credit Suisse (CS) and JPMorgan (JPM) have also been reluctant to settle with the monolines. Flagstar is sharply higher in a bright red market as the settlement removes a big overhang on the stock.

Wells already exceeds the 6% proposed ratio, but presumably BofA (BAC -2.8%), JPMorgan (JPM -1.3%), Citigroup (C -4%), Goldman (GS -1.7%), and Morgan Stanley (MS -3.1%) would need to halt or pare back dividends and buybacks should the rule be implemented.

Smith was present at settlement talks in 2011 between BofA and the largest investors in soured MBS. Contrary to the glad-handing described by the settlement "objectors," the meetings were hostile, says Smith (testifying at the Article 77 hearing), with BofA's initial position being the grandchildren of the grandchildren of the investors would never recover a dime.

Jun. 6, 2013, 6:50 AM|Jun. 5, 2013, 9:36 AM|Day 2 of Bank of America's (BAC) Article 77 hearing led off with a new revelation: Chief Risk Officer Terry Laughlin in Nov. 2011 told the 22 institutional investors in favor of the settlement the bank had been given permission to put Countrywide into bankruptcy if the mortgage lender's liabilities threatened the BofA's viability - the message clearly being the $8.5B settlement was a pretty good outcome for those suffering losses. Naturally, the "objectors" say there were other options rather than signing off on a "sweetheart deal."

A lawyer for BlackRock says it and other firms agreed to the settlement rather than risk BofA putting Countrywide into bankruptcy. Observing the proceeding, Mike Mayo says there's "significant legal tail risk" for BofA.

While BofA is the de facto defendant, the actual defendant is BNY Mellon (BK) - the trustee for the 530 Countrywide mortgage trusts at issue. The defendants may want quick resolution, but the Judge told the parties "we're not going to be done with this in June."

Stakes are high given BofA has reserved just $8.5B for potential payouts, but objectors - including AIG, Triaxx, and 3 FHLB banks - will point to recoveries received by MBIA and Ambac north of $0.60 on the dollar. With losses at $108B - well, you do the math. Yes, the bar for the objectors to overcome is a high one, but - thanks to a series of recent rulings - not as high as a year ago.

While heavyweights such as BlackRock (BLK) and Goldman Sachs (GS) support the deal, it faces opposition from AIG (AIG), which says it has $10.5B worth of claims against BofA. Approval of the agreement would enable the bank to take a major step in cleaning up the mess it inherited when it bought Countrywide. 

Jun. 3, 2013, 3:22 AM|May 30, 2013, 10:30 PM|Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan has vowed to finally make cross-selling work, but he faces resistance from the thundering herd at Merrill Lynch. One example is a new bonus formula which puts the bank's interests at odds with those of Merrill clients. Brokers are also wary of steering customers to the bank for a mortgage only to be hit by rejections or lousy customer service. "We're going to hand (the client) over to this mortgage process and then 3 months later they hate you," says a (former) wealth manager. By the way, BAC touched a 2+ year high today. 

May 30, 2013, 10:30 PM|May 30, 2013, 4:29 PM|AIG drops its lawsuit against the FRBNY over who may sue over losses suffered by the company on MBS. The Fed's Maiden Lane II took over the securities as part of the bailout, and the issue was whether AIG gave up its right to sue when it unloaded the paper. The move comes even as a judge earlier this month said AIG did not relinquish its right to sue Bank of America (BAC) over mortgages issued by Countrywide.          

May 30, 2013, 4:29 PM|May 30, 2013, 3:06 AM|Fiat (FIATY.PK) is reportedly in negotiations with major banks to borrow up to $10B that the Italian carmaker would use to acquire the 41.5% of Chrysler it doesn't own and refinance the two companies' debt at lower interest rates. The banks include Bank of America (BAC), Deutsche Bank (DB), Goldman Sachs (GS) (GS) and BNP Paribas (BNOBF.PK). Fiat's purchase of the holding is being held up by a legal dispute over the value of the stake.

If he's right, it could explain the resilience of Citigroup (C +1.1%) (still with heavy exposure to maybe not-so-toxic assets through Citi Holdings), and Bank of America (BAC +1%) amid today's big decline.

It is fading though, he allows, and likely to account for about 10% of profit at large and mid-cap banks this year and 1% next year vs. 22% in 2012. At the top of the list of those benefitting sits Bank of America (BAC). Also: Synovus Financial (SNV), Citigroup (C), and PNC.

In a letter to the settlement monitor (obtained by Reuters), Schneirderman says other states "have identified similar recurring deficiencies." The AG considers the letter to have started the clock on a "waiting period" necessary before a lawsuit may be filed.

May 21, 2013, 9:11 AM|May 17, 2013, 2:59 PM|Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citigroup (C) have halted the vast majority of foreclosure sales in numerous states following the release of new standards from the OCC, reports the American Banker. Harkening back to the days of the robo-signing scandal, Wells' foreclosure sales across 5 westerns states dropped to fewer than 10 per day in April from more than 300 previously. JPMorgan (JPM) also slowed sales, but has returned to normal activity. BofA (BAC) is proceeding as usual. 

May 17, 2013, 2:59 PM|May 16, 2013, 3:55 PM|Described as a win for Wall Street's biggest swaps dealers - JPM, BAC, C, MS, and GS - the CFTC approves new swap trading rules 3 years after the passage of Dodd-Frank. The rules mandate new trading platforms making bids and offers public, but require traders send request for bids to just two firms before execution rather than the five some had called for. Smaller exchanges aren't sweating it, instead happy they now have a defined system to operate under. 

May 16, 2013, 3:55 PM|May 10, 2013, 1:00 PM|Bank of America (BAC) fights back against NY's crusading AG, telling Eric Schneiderman he has no right to sue over violations to the $25B mortgage settlement without giving the bank time to cure said violations (which the bank denies making). The settlement, say BofA lawyers, gives the bank 42 days to act after being notified of any issues.

May 10, 2013, 7:21 AM|May 7, 2013, 1:02 PM|A new twist in the legal battle between AIG and BAC as a judge rules the insurer did not give up its right to sue BofA over $7B in MBS-related losses even though it unloaded the paper as part of its bailout. The FRBNY has already settled with BofA over MBS its Maiden Lane II took in from AIG as part of the rescue.          

May 7, 2013, 1:02 PM|May 6, 2013, 4:57 PM|More on the BofA/MBIA settlement: As the settlement occurred prior to the filing of BofA's (BAC) 10-Q, the bank will take a Q1 charge of $1.5B, or $0.10/share, bringing net income down from $0.20/share to $0.10. The Tier 1 Capital Ratio will increase 10 bps to 9.52%, reflecting the reduction in risk-weighted assets associated with terminated CDS contracts. Tangible book value drops $0.10/share to $13.36. In addition to cash of about $1.7B, BofA will provide a $500M credit line to MBIA Insurance. It will also receive warrants to purchase 9.94M shares of MBIA (MBI) stock - roughly a 4.9% stake - at an exercise price of $9.59/share anytime prior to May 2018. (PR) 

May 6, 2013, 4:57 PM|May 6, 2013, 12:54 PM|More on the BofA/MBIA settlement: Bank of America (BAC +4%) will pay MBIA's mortgage insurance arm about $1.6B plus some IOUs, bringing the total amount to $1.7B, reports the WSJ. Additionally, the bank will take about a 5% stake in the holding company, MBIA (MBI +41.9%). It's a win-win as MBIA Insurance gets a lifeline and BofA removes the potential of a far larger award at trial. Congrats to BTIG's Mark Palmer and keen bloggers like Christian Herzeca who recognized MBIA's legal "loss" last week as a big push for BofA to get this thing settled.

At issue are improvements in servicing standards such as ending the bureaucratic nightmare of loan mods or foreclosure relief. Schneiderman's office has reportedly documented 210 violations against Wells, and 129 against BofA since October. 

May 6, 2013, 10:02 AM|May 6, 2013, 8:14 AM|Bank of America (BAC) gets welcome news as NY and Delaware drop their objections to the $8.5B settlement over Countrywide MBS, saying new facts have been uncovered. The chances this settlement could get thrown out this month by a judge is one of the last refuges of the BofA bears (if you ask the BofA bulls). Previous: The FHFA drops its objections. Shares +0.7% premarket. 

May 6, 2013, 8:14 AM|May 3, 2013, 2:44 PM|Bank of America's (BAC +0.5%) $8.5B settlement to take care of claims from Countrywide-backed MBS should be rejected, says a group of investors led by AIG in a NY State Supreme Court filing today. Separately however, the FHFA withdrew its "conditional objection" to the settlement. The Article 77 hearing is set to begin on May 30. BofA would be open to massive liability should a judge throw out the agreement.

Apr. 30, 2013, 1:30 PM|Apr. 30, 2013, 11:54 AM|MBIA (MBI -5.8%) investors are disappointed at not winning summary judgement in the case against Bank of America, but the ruling as a whole sends "a very strong message to BAC about how difficult it would be for it to win at trial," writes Mark Palmer. He still expects BofA to cut a deal either out of self-interest or after being forced to the table by regulators. MKM Partners agrees and maintains its Buy rating and $18 price target. 

Apr. 30, 2013, 11:54 AM|Apr. 30, 2013, 10:42 AM|Bank of America (BAC) asks a federal judge to dismiss a $1B DOJ lawsuit accusing its Countrywide unit of selling defective mortgages to Fannie and Freddie just as the real estate market was busting. District Judge Jed Rakoff - after hearing arguments this morning - says he intends to issue a ruling in about two weeks.          

Apr. 30, 2013, 10:42 AM|Apr. 29, 2013, 7:49 PM|MBIA (MBI) sinks 5.5% AH after it fails to win summary judgement against Bank of America's (BAC) Countrywide unit in a lawsuit over whether the bank breached its obligations to repurchase loans. Attorney Christian Herzeca notes the judge found each point of law in MBIA's favor, but as "sufficient facts remain in dispute," a trial is necessary.          

Apr. 29, 2013, 7:49 PM|Apr. 29, 2013, 10:26 AM|Citigroup's (C) reluctance to pare its mortgage assets at fire-sale prices could pay off, says KBW, as it now stands to greatly benefit from rising home prices. It's a flow vs. stock argument as Citi - compared to WFC, JPM, or USB - does a relatively small amount of (now under profit-pressure) mortgage origination volume, but still has loads of questionable paper on its books. Also positioned to benefit is BAC.

In this great 35-minute chat from late last year, he again makes his case for AIG and BAC - "it's the 90s all over again" - and SHLD - selling for the liquidation value of its merchandise; the brands and the real estate are free. 

Apr. 28, 2013, 9:08 AM|Apr. 26, 2013, 11:23 AM|Bank of America (BAC) shareholders better familiarize themselves with Article 77, writes Mark Palmer, as it's possible the $8.5B the bank has reserved to handle claims against Countrywide MBS will be woefully small. At issue is an Article 77 proceeding set to begin May 30 at which a judge could toss the $8.5B settlement. The number might then reach as high as $60.5B, writes Palmer - about 24% of the bank's book value.

Filed in 2011, the case has been on hold while the venue is determined, but stems from what AIG claims were frauds and misrepresentations on $28B of MBS purchased from BofA, Merrill, and Countrywide.

Key to MBIA will be whether a judge approves the $8.5B settlement over $108B in Countrywide-related mortgage losses. This ratio is key, and if a judge feels it should be higher, the "hyenas (will) come to feast."

Apr. 1, 2013, 4:02 PM|Apr. 1, 2013, 12:00 PM|Bank of America (BAC) is biggest so it's only natural it should lead by a wide margin in mortgage-related complaints made to the CFPB, according to the bank, which blames its #1 spot on the Countrywide acquisition. BofA accounts for 29% of all complaints filed to date, compared to #2 Wells Fargo (WFC) with 16%.

The suit, which alleges breach of representations and warranties related to the securitizations, was filed Friday in New York State Supreme Court.  

Mar. 30, 2013, 10:44 AM|Mar. 29, 2013, 7:34 AM|BofA (BAC) and Societe Generale (SCGLF.PK) have appealed a judge's denial of a lawsuit in which they sought to reverse regulatory approval of MBIA's (MBI) restructuring in 2009. The bank's argue that overhaul harmed them as policy holders, and that the authorization "was arbitrary and capricious and an abuse of discretion." 

Mar. 29, 2013, 7:34 AM|Mar. 27, 2013, 10:16 AM|"I could do this the rest of my life," says Bank of America (BAC) CEO Moynihan of his current job. The days of acquisitions, share buybacks, and dividends all at the same time are over, he says, vowing to forego some profit during good times so as not to give it all back during the bad. Think of it as the anti-Chick Prince: "While the music's playing, you've got to dance." 

Mar. 27, 2013, 10:16 AM|Mar. 26, 2013, 1:08 PM|M&T Bank (MTB) looks to benefit as Bank of America (BAC) shutters its mortgage-servicing operation in Western New York, not only growing its own servicing business, but taking over the lease for BofA's 132K square foot facility, and maybe hiring most if not all of the employees scheduled to be let go.          

Mar. 26, 2013, 1:08 PM|Mar. 25, 2013, 8:01 AM|New compensation policy at Bank of America (BAC) will reportedly require CEO Moynihan and other top executives to hold onto their stock for at least a year after retirement. Previously, they were able to sell company shares immediately upon retirement. The new requirements "demonstrate the alignment of the interests of the (execs) with those of the company's stockholders," says BofA. 

Mar. 25, 2013, 8:01 AM|Mar. 20, 2013, 3:56 AM|Freddie Mac (FMCC.OB) has sued Bank of America (BAC) JPMorgan (JPM), Citigroup (C) and 12 other major banks for losses caused by the manipulation of the Libor rate. Freddie, which invested in mortgage bonds and swaps tied to U.S. dollar Libor, is seeking a whole gamut of damages for what it sees as fraud, antitrust violations and breach of contract. The FHFA has already calculated that Freddie and Fannie Mae lost $3B in total because of the Libor manipulation.

It's got value, catalysts, and momentum, she says, a very rare triple threat for a big bank. $15/share is a chip shot and the stock's a double over the next 18 months, she tells CNBC.

Mar. 14, 2013, 4:54 PM|Mar. 14, 2013, 7:57 AM|A Dallas Fed plan to cap assets at FDIC-insured banks at $250B would force most of the TBTFs to more than halve their consumer and business-lending units. Such a limit, says Dallas Fed EVP Rosenblum, is required to allow the FDIC to shut them down without using taxpayer funds. The Dallas proposal isn't becoming law anytime soon, but it is driving the debate in D.C. 

Mar. 14, 2013, 7:57 AM|Mar. 14, 2013, 7:18 AM|Bank of America (BAC) has reportedly hired Grant Chamberlain to be its head of M&A, poaching him from Nomura where he was that lender's chief of Australian M&A. At the moment BofA isn't a player of note in Australian M&A, but that seems likely to change.          

Mar. 14, 2013, 7:18 AM|Mar. 14, 2013, 4:48 AM|The SEC has said that JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS), as well as Citigroup (C), don't have to hold votes at their annual meetings on motions that would require them to consider "extraordinary transactions," including being broken up. The proposals came from labor and religious groups, with a motion from the AFL-CIO, for example, saying that JPM's $6B whaling loss had shown that it had become too big to manage. 

Mar. 14, 2013, 4:48 AM|Mar. 11, 2013, 11:52 AM|Bank of America (BAC) managing director Raphael Zagury - the head of derivative investments in wealth management - resigns after 5 years on the job. He declined to comment on the circumstances.

Mar. 8, 2013, 7:40 AM|Mar. 7, 2013, 5:09 PM|After-hours movers following the Fed Stress Tests: Citigroup (C +2.5%) is the biggest gainer after looking like it's the most overcapitalized of the large banks with a 8.3% common ratio. BAC +0.8%. GS -0.7%, MS -1% after both just squeaked over the 5% bar. There's not a lot of movement in the rest of the banks.          

Mar. 7, 2013, 5:09 PM|Mar. 7, 2013, 4:50 PM|More on the Fed Stress Tests: The exams measured to make sure banks' Tier 1 Common Ratio remained above 5% in the Fed's "severely adverse" economic scenario - GDP falling 5%, the UE rate rising to 12%, a 50% fall in stocks, and recessions overseas, among a number of other variables. This table shows the results, with GS and MS just passing, and BAC, C, WFC, and JPM getting by with a little more room. 

Mar. 7, 2013, 4:50 PM|Mar. 7, 2013, 4:37 PM|Fed Stress Tests: Ally Financial is the only bank not meeting the Fed standards.  All of the other 18 holding companies showed a Tier 1 Common Ratio higher than 5% under the central bank's severe loss scenario.

Mar. 7, 2013, 11:01 AM|Mar. 7, 2013, 5:37 AM|The WSJ highlights how Bank of America (BAC) made a net profit of around $1.14M on trading options in Constellation Brands (STZ) in the summer, around the time the latter said it was acquiring Crown Imports from AB InBev (BUD) as part of the Belgian brewer's acquisition of full control of Modelo. BofA was an adviser on the Modelo deal and played a crucial role in the funding of both transactions. BofA says that the Chinese wall between different parts of the bank was maintained. 

Mar. 7, 2013, 5:37 AM|Mar. 6, 2013, 12:53 PM|Bank of America (BAC) is engaged in "accounting arbitrage" says Manal Mehta, reserving far less for legal cases than it may have to pay out. If regulators forced the bank to properly account for the possible losses, it's likely they would disallow any capital returns and force BofA to continue socking away its profits. 

Mar. 6, 2013, 12:53 PM|Mar. 6, 2013, 10:57 AM|All 17 bank holding companies subject to Fed stress tests will pass the exam, says Credit Suisse's Moshe Orenbuch (results due Thursday). He thus sees payout ratios for the group rising to 64% of earnings this year from 36% in 2012, with BofA (BAC), Citigroup (C), and Regions Financial (RF) getting the biggest bump. Morgan Stanley (MS) and SunTrust (STI) should also see sizable increases.

WFC, FITB, and MTB are in the middle of the pack and should be allowed payouts of 50-75%. Capital laggards - BAC, C, and COF - may only be allowed payouts of 10-30% of earnings. 

Mar. 5, 2013, 7:39 AM|Mar. 4, 2013, 1:11 PM|MBIA (MBI +24%) soars after after a NY state judge denies Bank of America's (BAC) petition to overturn the insurer's 2009 restructuring. This ruling doesn't appear to affect a parallel suit between the two regarding putbacks.          

Mar. 4, 2013, 1:11 PM|Mar. 4, 2013, 11:55 AM|Expect gradual, but not outsized jumps in capital returns from the banks this year, says Goldman (stress tests results are due Thursday, capital return decisions due March 14). Management teams are likely to be conservative in their requests from the Fed as "taking a mulligan" - i.e., resubmitting a plan after being shot down - is not seen as a viable option.

Feb. 20, 2013, 6:25 PM|Feb. 19, 2013, 5:23 PM|More on Bank of America (BAC) (previous): The board approves a 60% increase in CEO Moynihan's base salary to $1.5M in 2013. Between his base salary ($950K) and stock bonus, he earned nearly $12M in 2012. 

Feb. 19, 2013, 5:23 PM|Feb. 19, 2013, 4:33 PM|Bank of America (BAC) CEO Moynihan received $950K in pay in 2012, but a nice boost in his (all-stock bonus), which sums to about $11M vs. $7M in 2011.

Bank of America (BAC) added $24.3B (a 28% increase) in new 401(k) assets last year, with clients who had an existing relationship with the bank doubling their retirement business. All the big banks are eying a bigger slice of the $3.5T 401(k) market, traditionally dominated by the likes of Fidelity and Vanguard.          

Feb. 19, 2013, 7:44 AM|Feb. 17, 2013, 3:41 AM|The NY Fed is apparently trying to let BofA (BAC) off the hook for possible sizable legal claims related to former AIG (AIG) mortgage securities held by Maiden Lane II following the insurer's bailout in 2008. AIG has sued BofA to recover some of the $18B loss it suffered on the assets, but the bank argues that AIG gave its right to sue to the NY Fed when it sold the assets. The latter agrees and has released BofA from most of the connected legal liabilities even though it's not yet certain that the NY Fed has the right to do so. 

Feb. 17, 2013, 3:41 AM|Feb. 15, 2013, 7:38 AM|"The Goldilocks era of post-crisis M&A has never been an if, but a when," says JPMorgan (JPM) vice-chair James Lee. "CEOs are declaring that day has come." Including the Berkshire buy, $40B in deals were announced yesterday and $140B this month. Transaction volume is up 27% Y/Y vs. an 8% slump for 2012. It should mean sweet profits for the newly lean banks.

DJIA +0.5%. Dragged by Tim Cook's dismissal of Einhorn, the Nasdaq is flat.          

Feb. 12, 2013, 1:48 PM|Feb. 12, 2013, 10:15 AM|There's an investing lesson in here somewhere. Harris Interactive's 2013 Reputation Quotient survey shows Amazon (AMZN) moving past Apple as the country's reputation leader. Bank of America (BAC) retains a spot in the bottom 5 (along with HAL, GS, and AIG), but enjoyed the largest reputation rebound in 2012. Maybe of most interest are those dropping off the list of visible companies, including: UPS, KSS, and GIS.

The ruling - says a lawyer - puts to rest the main argument MBS originators like BofA and JPMorgan have put forth to counter insurers' claims their breaches of representations and warranties did not cause losses. BAC and JPM both down about 1% premarket.

If the valuation - currently at just over 0.5x book - moves to just a modest slightly-above book, the stock's a 4-bagger. There's a growth story here as well, he says. Should the GSEs wind down, banks and insurers like AIG are poised to grab the business.

The filings are part of a lawsuit by three Federal Home Loan Banks and an investment vehicle which argues BofA's proposed $8.5B deal to compensate investors who suffered losses because of Countrywide's mortgage abuses is not enough. The documents could raise new doubts about whether a judge will approve the deal.

Feb. 1, 2013, 6:00 AM|Jan. 30, 2013, 4:34 PM|Fairholme is closing 3 of its funds to new investors as of the end of February. It's not about heavy inflows; instead Bruce Berkowitz is fed up with outflows and prefers a smaller, core group of investors who understand his deep-value process. Berkowitz might also be having trouble finding investments, having narrowed his holdings to basically just AIG, SHLD, BAC, JOE, CIT, LUK, and MBIA (GGP was sold last night).

According to transcripts of the call released by the Fed on Friday, Geithner at the time denied that banks knew the Fed was considering making any cut.

Jan. 16, 2013, 5:30 PM|Jan. 16, 2013, 10:45 AM|After getting whipsawed by housing over the past 6 years - buying Countrywide as housing was imploding, then backing off the mortgage business just as it was sent to zoom higher - Bank of America (BAC) wants back in. Having jettisoned its correspondent mortgage operations and ceded ground to competitors, growing the business will be easier said than done. 

Jan. 16, 2013, 10:45 AM|Jan. 14, 2013, 1:00 PM|Bank of America (BAC -1.4%) is cut to Hold at Sandler O'Neill.

The FRBNY - which already got its own settlement from BofA - is of the opinion AIG lost its right to sue when it sold the securities to Maiden Lane.

The charge shows how banks pushed to close the deal so they could include the costs in their upcoming reports using "subsequent-events" accounting rules, allowing them to start 2013 with a cleaner slate.

Bernstein also expects BofA to get approval for a $3B share buyback, and JPMorgan $8B. 

Nov. 13, 2012, 10:56 AM|Nov. 13, 2012, 8:39 AM|Bank of America (BAC) CEO Moynihan trumpets (webcast and slides) the bank's balance sheet moves, saying the sale of $60B in non-core assets since 2010 has generated $12B in Tier 1 capital while costing less than $2B in earnings. The bank's capital ratio has improved, he says, from industry laggard to leader. 

Nov. 13, 2012, 8:39 AM|Nov. 11, 2012, 8:44 AM|Forget the low end of JPMorgan's (JPM) assertion of $0-$6B in possible losses from the FHFA lawsuit over $33B in MBS, writes Alison Frankel. A judge's Monday decision allowing the suit (and a similar one against Merrill Lynch) to go forward blew up nearly every argument made by the banks, including the key one that Frannie - being so sophisticated with MBS - should have known better. The banks don't want this is front of a jury. Look for a settlement before the summer 2014 trial date.          

Nov. 11, 2012, 8:44 AM|Nov. 9, 2012, 5:42 AM|BofA (BAC) may be able to dodge a $1B bullet in a lawsuit over mortgage-bond fraud, due to the problematic past of the whistleblower in the case. Former Countrywide exec Edward O'Donnell, along with the DOJ, is suing BofA for the alleged fraud against Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. However, O'Donnell now works at Fannie and has himself been accused of fraud. 

Nov. 9, 2012, 5:42 AM|Nov. 9, 2012, 5:27 AM|District Judge Denise Cote yesterday mostly denied a Merrill Lynch request to throw out a lawsuit from the FHFA which alleges that the BofA (BAC) unit made negligent misrepresentations and carried out fraud related to the mortgage bonds that it sold from 2005-2007.

Barclays (BCS) and BNP Paribas will need an extra 2%, while eight banks, including BofA (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS), will need 1.5%. Overall, 28 banks are considered "global systemically important" and have to hold extra capital. Lloyds (LYG) has dropped off the list but BBVA (BBVA) and StanChart have joined it.

Instead, BofA says customers may qualify for some waivers but only if they first call the bank via an 800 number or by visiting a branch. Most banks also are proactively waiving fees on using out-of-network ATMs, but here again BofA adopts a stricter policy.

Based on PVH's last closing stock price, the deal is worth $68.43 a share, representing a 34% premium over Warnaco's close on Friday. PVH has also received commitments for $4.33B in financing from Barclays (BCS), BofA (BAC) and Citigroup (C), some of which PVH will use for the merger. (PR) 

Oct. 31, 2012, 5:13 AM|Oct. 26, 2012, 6:12 AM|Bank of America (BAC) staff could face civil fraud charges as part of a government lawsuit that accuses the bank of misrepresenting the quality of home loans its Countrywide unit sold to Fannie and Freddie, causing losses of over $1B to taxpayers. It would be a rare move given the lack of cases brought against individuals over the financial crisis.

Oct. 25, 2012, 9:27 PM|Oct. 25, 2012, 12:32 PM|The latest lawsuit against Bank of America (BAC) is no surprise to FBR's Paul Miller (video), who thinks the $1B being tossed around is light. Of more concern is the ongoing battle between BofA and Fannie Mae on the amount of loans the GSE is demanding the bank buy back. Chris Whalen believes BofA may put Countrywide into bankruptcy to escape liability. Not so fast, says Miller, believing the two entities are far too intertwined.

Oct. 16, 2012, 5:30 PM|Oct. 16, 2012, 3:55 PM|Does Pandit's departure from Citigroup mean bank boards are beginning to take their responsibilities seriously? If so, Bank of America CEO Moynihan could be next. Moynihan inherited a mess (like Pandit), but has been unable to convince investors he has a strategy for getting out of it. Of even more import is the rebuilding of BAC's brand as a leading consumer bank.          

Oct. 16, 2012, 3:55 PM|Oct. 12, 2012, 6:14 PM|JPM’s Q3 results in investment banking and trading were impressive, a good sign for Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and perhaps BofA (BAC), KBW's Fred Cannon says: "The upside on the read-across leads us to believe BAC will post a beat to the Street in the quarter and gives us increased confidence around our $0.15 operating estimate."          

Oct. 12, 2012, 6:14 PM|Oct. 12, 2012, 8:52 AM|Dimon: "We expect to continue to be challenged by high default-related expenses." Regulatory guidance (pg. 8 of the presentation) is forcing higher charge-offs - $825M, or $0.14/share in Q3 - on certain mortgage loans. Wells Fargo (WFC) reported an additional $567M in charge-offs due to this. Keep an eye on BAC and C reports. JPM -0.7% premarket.          

Oct. 12, 2012, 8:52 AM|Oct. 11, 2012, 4:41 PM|It's the usual suspects who stand to be affected by Fed Governor Tarullo's call to cap the size of banks' non-deposit liabilities. JPM, BAC, GS, and C all have ratios greater than 5% of U.S. GDP. Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) are substantially below. "This is a major new direction for the Fed," says Simon Johnson.

Oct. 11, 2012, 4:41 PM|Oct. 11, 2012, 11:09 AM|With banks set to report Q3 earnings, regulators will have an eye on how much of a boost profits get by slashing reserves for bad loans. Perfectly legal, the action nevertheless gives an unsustainable boost to profit - it's accounted for 23% of the bottom line for TBTFs over the last year - making banks look healthier just at the time they've thinned cushions against the next downturn. 

Oct. 11, 2012, 11:09 AM|Oct. 11, 2012, 6:48 AM|Expect continued substantial headcount reductions at Bank of America (BAC), says CEO Moynihan. "It's really based on demand," he says, noting flat revenues amidst the flat yield curve and flat economy. "When I talk tour clients ... they don't expect to hire a lot more people."

The rule - which perversely adds to earnings as a bank's credit deteriorates (and subtracts from the bottom line as credit improves) - has been behind big whipsaws in reported numbers in recent quarters (Q3 will be no exception). "(It's) one of the more ridiculous concepts that's ever been invented in accounting," says Jamie Dimon. 

Sep. 30, 2012, 10:15 PM|Sep. 28, 2012, 6:15 PM|Legal settlements often ease investors’ minds, but the size of BofA's (BAC -1.5%) $2.34B tab for settling claims it misled investors about Merrill Lynch’s financial health before its purchase was an unwelcome surprise. Some analysts worry BofA’s legal exposure doesn’t seem to be tapering off; it's the bank's 11th settlement totaling $29B since the start of the financial crisis. 

Sep. 28, 2012, 6:15 PM|Sep. 28, 2012, 9:40 AM|More on the BofA (BAC -0.9%) settlement: The $2.43B payment will be covered by existing litigation reserves and Q3 litigation expenses of $1.6B. Additionally, the bank expects Q3 pre-tax earnings to take a $1.9B hit as improving credit spreads force a DVA. The bank also tosses in an $800M charge thanks to U.K. corporate tax changes. All told, the expected hit to Q3 EPS is $0.28/share (the bank earned $0.19 in Q2). Previous (I, II).

Sep. 26, 2012, 5:07 PM|Sep. 26, 2012, 2:30 PM|Wall Street firms will likely reduce bonuses rather than cut jobs to control expenses this year, says Morgan Stanley's Betsy Graseck. Compensation will probably drop from a year ago as banks attempt to avoid further headcount reductions after culling their ranks heavily last year, with most of the cuts coming from employee bonuses rather than base salaries. And bonuses, as we all know, represent a disproportionately large percentage of the income for Wall Street professionals. 

Sep. 26, 2012, 2:30 PM|Sep. 24, 2012, 12:51 PM|Bank of America (BAC) suffered a loss of around $10M on Friday with a "dividend trade" in which traders sell call options the day before an ETF goes ex-dividend with the intention of buying them back cheaper. The play is a favorite of big operators, but - as Friday's experience shows - is definitely not risk-free.

The cuts are part of "Project BAC," which aims to bring savings of $8B a year by 2015. Most of the layoffs will probably come in BofA's consumer ops, with the bank intending to close 200 branches on top of the 178 it shut in 2011.

By the end of Q2, the fund exited BAC, and slashed two-thirds of its JPM stake. Already a fan of energy, Cooperman added a stake in red-hot McMoRan Exploration (MMR). (13-F)          

Aug. 14, 2012, 4:49 PM|Aug. 14, 2012, 5:44 AM|A former BofA (BAC) employee, Doug Campbell, yesterday testified in a trial of three UBS execs that he conspired to rig bids in the municipal reinvestment market with them. The execs showed Campbell information about transactions in advance, and in return, he would submit intentionally losing bids in some deals and falsely bill BofA clients for UBS work.          

Aug. 14, 2012, 5:44 AM|Aug. 13, 2012, 3:48 AM|Bank of America (BAC) agrees to sell Merrill Lynch's private bank outside the U.S. to Switzerland's Julius Baer for 1.47B Swiss francs ($1.5B). The deal is the latest in a series of divestitures from BofA, which needs a strong cash position to meet Basel III requirements and to pay for all its legal liabilities. 

Aug. 13, 2012, 3:48 AM|Aug. 12, 2012, 4:30 AM|The FDIC filed suit on Friday against 11 major banks for allegedly mispresenting the quality of the loans that were packaged together in over $388M of mortgage bonds sold to Alabama-based Colonial Bank, which failed three years ago after being defrauded by Taylor, Bean & Whitaker Mortgage. The banks sued include the usual suspects of JPMorgan (JPM), Citigroup (C), BofA (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC).

Aug. 9, 2012, 4:56 AM|Aug. 6, 2012, 5:57 AM|Major Wall Street banks such as BofA (BAC), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) have generally cut their exposure to the eurozone as fears of a breakup increase, while they're also making preparations behind the scenes, the FT reports. These include trying to ensure that contracts denominated in euros won't be converted to any revived currency.  

Aug. 6, 2012, 5:57 AM|Aug. 3, 2012, 5:58 AM|More on BofA (BAC): BofA also said in its 10-Q that it has received inquiries from regulators about ID theft protection it sold via third-party vendors and whether the bank had proper oversight of those vendors. Clients could have paid for the services but not received them.  (earlier I, II)  

Aug. 3, 2012, 5:58 AM|Aug. 3, 2012, 5:52 AM|More on BofA (BAC): talks with Fannie Mae (FNMA.OB) over the latter's request that BofA buy back billions of dollars of bad mortgages have become more constructive recently, Reuters reports.

Aug. 3, 2012, 5:12 AM|Jul. 31, 2012, 12:18 PM|Banks haven't over-fired, says Meredith Whitney, arguing the big lenders are only about halfway through their expense-cutting cycle. "I hope I'm around when the over-hiring phase returns." Washington can stay out of the "break 'em up" debate, she says as shareholders are taking care of it, not investing until the banks show they can "earn their cost of capital."  

Jul. 31, 2012, 12:18 PM|Jul. 30, 2012, 1:03 PM|Talking about breaking up the big banks is officially trending, with sources indicating Bank of America (BAC) execs and officers discussed the idea but decided against it. In the meantime, "Fast Eddie" Crutchfield, who M&Aed First Union into a sizable player in the 90s, joins Sandy Weil and Phil Purcell: Putting "gargantuan, completely unrelated businesses under one roof is probably not a good idea."

OAK is off 14% since its April IPO and trades at a discount to other asset managers, even with Marks' impressive track record - especially during difficult markets. Goldman's a value trap as cyclical and secular changes mean the bank's days of 25-30% ROE aren't coming back.  

Jul. 29, 2012, 8:36 AM|Jul. 24, 2012, 6:08 AM|BofA (BAC) has received a boost in its attempts to receive court agreement for an $8.5B mortgage-bond settlement with investors after an important opponent of the deal, Boston hedge fund Baupost, said it wished to "withdraw as an intervener in this proceeding." That leaves AIG as the last significant objector to the agreement.  

Jul. 24, 2012, 6:08 AM|Jul. 23, 2012, 4:59 PM|Bank of America (BAC) begins rolling out credit card technology aimed at cutting down on hassles U.S. cardholders may encounter when trying to make purchases while abroad. BAC hopes to make sure their international travelers "don't get inconvenienced when traveling overseas with  just a mag stripe, which doesn't work so well there any more," an analyst says.  

Jul. 23, 2012, 4:59 PM|Jul. 23, 2012, 2:23 PM|Bank of America (BAC +0.3%) is posting a small gain on an ugly day for financials, thanks to positive comments from JPMorgan. The remarks come as BofA reports it reduced its ATM footprint by 9%, or 1,536 units, in 1H, in large part by removing most of the systems installed at U.S. gas stations and malls. The removals are part of BofA's efforts to produce $8B in expense cuts, and to focus on its most profitable clients.  

Jul. 23, 2012, 2:23 PM|Jul. 20, 2012, 5:50 AM|Requests from investors for banks to repurchase soured mortgages have intensified over recent months, a trend that has come to light in the latest earnings reports. BofA (BAC) - who else? - faces the worst of  it, with outstanding claims soaring over 40% to $22B in Q2. Other affected banks include Wells Fargo (WFC), PNC Financial Services Group (PNC) and Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB).           

Jul. 20, 2012, 5:50 AM|Jul. 19, 2012, 1:03 PM|The 30 bp decline in Bank of America's (BAC) net interest margin represents $1.27B in lost quarterly earnings power, says Josh Steiner, a "hit (that) is recurring, not one time." This deterioration in bank's underlying business may help explain the sharp decline in the stock (-4% today,  -4.8% yesterday) despite a headline beat on earnings thanks to a large reserve release.  

Jul. 19, 2012, 1:03 PM|Jul. 18, 2012, 2:42 PM|A nice in move higher in the broad averages leaves the big banks behind. Hit particularly hard is Bank of America (BAC -4.4%), which delivered a nice headline number, but the particulars of its underlying business (and future liabilities) leave less to be excited about. Reporting tomorrow is Morgan Stanley (MS -2.7%)           

Jul. 18, 2012, 2:42 PM|Jul. 18, 2012, 10:03 AM|BofA (BAC) conference call: One motif is the confusion of analysts who can't seem to decipher the bank's earnings. CFO Bruce Thompson blames the decline in both consumer and business loans to runoff in real estate. Total headcount is off 4% Y/Y, but down 8% if new hires in delinquent mortgage servicing are backed out. The company confirms it is being questioned by regulators over Libor. Shares -1.7%.           

Jul. 18, 2012, 10:03 AM|Jul. 18, 2012, 8:50 AM|More on Bank of America (BAC): The company reports a $6.6B surge to $22.7B in Outstanding Claims by Counterparty, yet just a $15.9B liability against this, meaning the bank could be underreserved by $6.8B. Previous quarters show these reserves greater than Outstanding Claims (see pg. 16 of the Earnings Presentation). Conference call here. Shares give up premarket gains, -0.1%.

Jul. 18, 2012, 7:50 AM|Jul. 18, 2012, 7:29 AM|More on BofA (BAC): Net interest income -14.9% Y/Y as net interest margin declines 30 bps to just 2.21%. Cost-cutting: Non-interest expenses -11% sequentially, and -25.8% Y/Y. Reserve release accounted for $0.11 (vs. $0.07 expected) of $0.19 earnings for the quarter.

The calculation excludes the potential fallout from ongoing U.S. and EU cartel investigations, which could result in multibillion-dollar fines.

Jul. 11, 2012, 2:22 PM|Jul. 11, 2012, 8:32 AM|Bank of America (BAC) efforts to help 60K homeowners slice a large chunk of principal of their mortgage balances are falling short of expectations as more than half haven't responded to mailings from the lender. Other large lenders are reporting far better success, suggesting some truth behind anecdotal reports of the difficulties of dealing with BofA.  

Jul. 11, 2012, 8:32 AM|Jul. 11, 2012, 7:32 AM|Bank of America (BAC) could lose a $480M revenue stream (3% of 2011 earnings), says Matthew O'Connor, thanks to expected new rules requiring banks process debit card transactions in the order they occur rather than from largest to smallest. Several big banks have already changed, but BofA - among others - hasn't, and continues to enjoy the easy money.  

Jul. 11, 2012, 7:32 AM|Jul. 11, 2012, 6:36 AM|BofA (BAC) has been cutting jobs in its commercial banking unit, sources say, part of the bank's efforts to cut costs while simultaneously trying to grow in a tepid economy.           

Jul. 11, 2012, 6:36 AM|Jul. 9, 2012, 12:44 PM|Trade the brokerages, writes Doug Kass, but don't invest in them. Forget the moral (and legal) abuses, the business model is broken, with the companies' key profit centers under assault on both a cyclical and structural basis. Toss in the flipside of higher capital requirements - lower returns on capital - and it's hard to make an investment case. (see also)  

Jul. 9, 2012, 12:44 PM|Jul. 5, 2012, 3:25 PM|More structural than cyclical is S&P's view of weak Wall Street earnings. Return on equity at the major investment banks - usually 15% in okay times - was just 7% in 2011. Goldman Sachs - legendary for killing it no matter what - earned just 3.7% ROE vs. 32.7% in 2007. Regulations, higher capital requirements, and toxic attitudes attitudes towards the TBTFs are all weighing.           

Jul. 5, 2012, 3:25 PM|Jul. 5, 2012, 2:58 AM|Bank shareholders have no idea what kind of liability they're facing from the Libor probe. Barclays, for example, dropped 16% the day after being blindsided by a $451.4M regulatory fine. More than a dozen banks are being probed, are providing minimal disclosures and are probably failing to put enough funds in reserve for potential fines.  

Jul. 5, 2012, 2:58 AM|Jul. 4, 2012, 11:15 AM|The Libor scandal isn't Barclays-specific or even U.K.-specific, says EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, and the rate-fixing accusations will likely involve banks in several countries. Yesterday, more than a dozen banks (including C, BAC, UBS) asked a U.S. judge to throw out Libor antitrust suits.           

Jul. 4, 2012, 11:15 AM|Jul. 3, 2012, 4:24 PM|There's no point to "living wills" for banks, says Dick Bove. The wills, which are supposed to provide a blueprint for FDIC regulators to deal with banks when they go belly up, simply interfere with a process that has been in place for decades. “I don’t see what the purpose is of coming up with a new statement," Bove quips, "because we’re still going to do it the way it was done 50 years ago.”  

Jul. 3, 2012, 4:24 PM|Jul. 3, 2012, 2:12 PM|The first group (9) of large banks have submitted their so-called living wills to the Fed and they've been made available to the public.

Jul. 1, 2012, 5:30 AM|Jun. 29, 2012, 8:26 AM|With one day to go in the year's first half, Bank of America (BAC) ranks as the Dow's top gainer, +39%. Next is Disney (DIS), +27.5%, then Home Depot (HD), +23%. Worst is Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), -24.8%, then McDonald's (MCD), -12%. Remember the Dogs of the Dow strategy?

Jun. 29, 2012, 8:26 AM|Jun. 29, 2012, 7:41 AM|Global investment banks' fee income fell 25% to $14B in Q2, according to Reuters data, with YTD fees of $32B off 25% from 2011. The numbers, along with trading revenues maybe off 40%, suggest Q2 earnings may not look so hot. Of course by now, none of this can be considered "new" news (see also) - perhaps, it's baked into stock prices.  

Jun. 29, 2012, 7:41 AM|Jun. 28, 2012, 7:45 AM|The big banks have their price targets and Q2 outlooks cut by Keith Horowitz's team at Citi. Net interest margins have slimmed, credit spreads are widening, and mortgage performance remains poor, say the analysts. XLF -0.6% premarket.

Barclays (BCS) -8.6% premarket as pressure grows for Diamond to quit, and JPMorgan (JPM) -5.2% on reports its trading loss could hit $9B. Perhaps in sympathy, other financial names are also dropping, outpacing the pullback by S&P futures: BAC -1.5%, MS -1.15%, C -1%, WFC -1%.  

Jun. 28, 2012, 6:25 AM|Jun. 27, 2012, 4:42 PM|Barclays' settlement over Libor-fixing claims gives immediate credibility to lawsuits worldwide against banks for buying financial instruments based on a manipulated rate. The sums are potentially huge as Libor is used to price pretty much everything rate-related. The BIS estimates the notional value of interest rate derivatives at $500T - even a tiny fraction would be a vast amount.  

Jun. 27, 2012, 4:42 PM|Jun. 27, 2012, 5:44 AM|JPMorgan (JPM), BofA (BAC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) are among the banks that are completing their "living wills" ahead of a deadline on July 1. The exercise could lead to the banks becoming less complex, as the law empowers regulators to order a firm to sell units if it cannot plan an orderly bankruptcy.  

Jun. 27, 2012, 5:44 AM|Jun. 26, 2012, 3:47 PM|Bank of America (BAC) is sued in a Florida federal court, accused of overcharging homeowners for force-placed insurance. Such policies are taken out by mortgage companies when borrowers' homeowners insurance lapses. As anyone who's ever had a paperwork mix-up and received a force-place warning from their lender knows, it can be a nice profit center for the bank.  

Jun. 26, 2012, 3:47 PM|Jun. 26, 2012, 8:05 AM|Forget the politics, says former Morgan Stanley CEO Phil Purcell, the best reason to break up the big banks is to benefit their shareholders.

The giant is apparently planning to get rid of up to one third of its directors and 10%-15% of its managing directors - typically the two most senior job ranks in the banking world - as tighter regulation and weak markets hit the sector hard.  

Jun. 25, 2012, 8:25 PM|Jun. 24, 2012, 4:48 AM|While Moody's downgrades could lead to increased borrowing rates for the affected banks, the action isn't expected to have a big impact on consumers in the short term. One reason, says RBC's Joseph Morford, is that "commercial banks are flush with deposits and liquidity," and are thereby relying less on debt to fund their ops.

Jun. 21, 2012, 3:09 PM|Jun. 21, 2012, 8:24 AM|A Moody's one-notch downgrade of the major banks for all but Morgan Stanley is priced in, says Mike Mayo. The surprise will be if a lender other than MS gets cut more than one notch, or if another ratings agency quickly follows. In any case, the move further cements his idea of Wells Fargo (WFC) as the big bank to own if you have to. (action may be imminent)

Mar. 31, 2012, 10:50 AM|Mar. 30, 2012, 12:07 PM|The biggest brokerages are targeting an ever-wealthier clientele to boost revenue and profitability, but a new study concludes a growing number of multi-millionaires are taking their money elsewhere. The share of high net worth customers' assets held by the top four brokers - MS, BAC, WFC and UBS - has dropped to 45% from 2007's 56% peak.  

Mar. 30, 2012, 12:07 PM|Mar. 28, 2012, 5:58 PM|Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan enjoyed a nice bump in total compensation in 2011, making $8.1M in 2011 vs. $1.8M in 2010 and 6.5M in 2009. In its proxy statement, the BofA board expressed confidence in its CEO - whose leadership often was questioned in 2011 - especially praising BAC’s renewed capital strength.  

Mar. 28, 2012, 5:58 PM|Mar. 28, 2012, 3:46 AM|Bank of America (BAC) is putting together an international advisory board to provide guidance on global strategy, sources say, as the U.S. powerhouse prepares for a greater global push.  

Mar. 28, 2012, 3:46 AM|Mar. 28, 2012, 3:27 AM|Here's the fine print from the $25B foreclosure settlement the five big mortgage banks signed last month: Of the $17B banks must earmark for "assistance to borrowers," more than half can be used in ways that won't stop foreclosures, including some activities that are already standard bank practices, such as demolishing abandoned houses.  

Mar. 28, 2012, 3:27 AM|Mar. 27, 2012, 9:25 AM|Bank of America (BAC) -0.7% premarket after shares are downgraded to Neutral by Baird. Most of the stock's strong YTD performance is attributable to improved capital levels, Baird says, but BAC must show stronger earnings potential to continue its outperformance. The firm prefers JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) "much clearer and less risky path to mid-cycle or normalized earnings."  

Mar. 27, 2012, 9:25 AM|Mar. 23, 2012, 6:03 AM|BofA (BAC) is launching a small pilot program that will let homeowners at risk of foreclosure hand over the deeds to their houses and then sign leases for BofA to rent the houses back to them at market rates. It's a shift in strategy for BofA and could be less costly to the bank than a regular eviction-and-foreclosure process, while doing less damage to borrowers' credit scores.  

Mar. 23, 2012, 6:03 AM|Mar. 22, 2012, 10:44 AM|Star employee Andrea Orcel plans to leave Bank of America's (BAC -1.2%) European operation to become co-head of UBS's investment banking unit, WSJ reports. The surprise move comes just a day before Orcel was to be promoted to become BofA's president for European operations.           

Mar. 22, 2012, 10:44 AM|Mar. 21, 2012, 10:23 AM|Bank of America (BAC +0.8%) will sell its Irish consumer credit card unit to Apollo Global (APO), the latest business unit sale by a shrinking BofA. The bank still plans to work with corporate clients on credit cards around the globe, but doesn’t think the international business, which was acquired when it bought credit card giant MBNA, is worth continuing.           

Mar. 21, 2012, 10:23 AM|Mar. 20, 2012, 2:19 PM|Despite Bank of America's (BAC +3.2%) latest denial of any capital-raising plans, WSJ's David Reilly thinks Brian Moynihan will need to consider taking advantage of BofA's recent share-price strength. "As painful as dilution is, the bank would still be highly geared to a U.S. economic recovery... a stronger balance sheet could actually put more wind under the stock's wings."  

Mar. 20, 2012, 2:19 PM|Mar. 20, 2012, 11:37 AM|The financial sector (XLF +0.2%) is the only positive performer in morning trade, coming after Jefferies (JEF +1.6%) reported better-than-expected fixed income and investment banking  revenue in its FQ1. Bank of America (BAC +3.2%) led the group after it denied a rumor that it would issue shares in a secondary offering. Also: GS +2.3%, MS +2.1%, C +1.6%.           

Mar. 20, 2012, 11:37 AM|Mar. 19, 2012, 5:12 PM|Bank of America (BAC) +2.1% AH after issuing a denial that it has any plans to issue shares, contrasting a market rumor that sent shares sliding late in the day. BofA did sell debt today, which the bank is likely to do as a way of financing activity, but a debt sale is far different than a share sale.           

Mar. 19, 2012, 5:12 PM|Mar. 19, 2012, 4:41 PM|After hitting levels not seen since August thanks to a bullish Morgan Stanley note, Bank of America (BAC -2.8%) sold off into the close. Rumors about a new secondary offering appear to have been a culprit, though the Street's skepticism about the sustainability of BofA's recent rally may have made a selloff overdue.  

Mar. 19, 2012, 4:41 PM|Mar. 19, 2012, 10:58 AM|Bank of America (BAC +2.6%), whose shares have now more than doubled from their Dec. 19 low, continues to power higher amid positive comments from Morgan Stanley. The firm raises earnings estimates and price targets for BofA, as well as C +3.3%, GS +1.5% and JPM +0.8%, citing stronger consumer credit among the reasons.  

Mar. 19, 2012, 10:58 AM|Mar. 16, 2012, 7:24 PM|The Fed says it made an error in its stress test of Citigroup (C) that led it to overstate a crucial measurement of losses on the bank’s mortgages. Smaller corrections were issued for BAC, WFC and MET, but the fixes did not change capital ratios projected by the stress tests.  

Mar. 16, 2012, 7:24 PM|Mar. 15, 2012, 6:20 PM|Matt Taibbi serves up his newest can of vitriol for "too crooked to fail" Bank of America (BAC), "not bankers or capitalists, but a class of person that was never supposed to exist in America: royalty." BofA has defrauded everyone from investors and insurers to  homeowners and the unemployed, Taibbi alleges, so why does the government keep bailing  it out?           

Mar. 15, 2012, 6:20 PM|Mar. 14, 2012, 10:48 AM|Citigroup's (C -3.2%) stress test failure may not be such a big fail as headlines suggest, some analysts say. DealBreaker's Matt Levine says it isn’t a failure of Citi’s current balance sheet, it’s a failure of the capital plans submitted to the Fed. Nomura notes Citi’s minimum stressed T1C ratio was a healthy 5.9% before proposed capital actions, vs. 5.7% for BAC and 6.3% for JPM.  

Mar. 14, 2012, 10:48 AM|Mar. 14, 2012, 9:49 AM|A big day yesterday for bank stocks isn't the end, says Dick Bove, calling for another 25% gain in the sector before year's end. The test "forced people to start looking at (positive) fundamentals and recognize that this industry for the last year has been doing extraordinarily well."           

Mar. 14, 2012, 9:49 AM|Mar. 13, 2012, 4:10 PM|Market recap: Stocks exploded higher after JPMorgan announced a dividend hike and buyback, likely the start of a chain reaction among banks as the Fed serves up stress test results. It was a nice day to own financials: JPM +7.3%, C +6.3%, BAC +6.3%, WFC +5.8%. Treasurys extended losses, pushing long-term yields to their highest since October. NYSE gainers led losers more than three to one.           

Mar. 13, 2012, 4:10 PM|Mar. 13, 2012, 3:31 PM|Bank of America (BAC +4.6%) has passed the Fed's stress test as well, say sources, but has not requested to do a buyback or increase its dividend, reports the WSJ. (earlier)

These nine stocks have high IR and could outperform: BAC, CCL, CF, GOOG, LO, ROK, SUN, THC, WFM.  

Mar. 12, 2012, 11:39 AM|Mar. 12, 2012, 8:10 AM|U.S. government officials reportedly will file the final version of the $25B mortgage servicing settlement in court today. An oft-discussed filing for late last week came and went Friday, as a disagreement between the state of Nevada and Bank of America (BAC) held up the deal at the last minute; the two sides wound up settling as part of a separate suit.           

Mar. 12, 2012, 8:10 AM|Mar. 9, 2012, 5:06 AM|Bank of America (BAC) has reportedly struck a side deal with the government over foreclosures that will allow the bank to reduce its penalties in exchange for bigger reductions of mortgage balances. According to the WSJ report, BofA will avoid as much as $850M in penalties by giving over 200K borrowers the chance to sharply reduce their mortgage balances.           

Mar. 9, 2012, 5:06 AM|Mar. 8, 2012, 2:49 PM|Banks that have rallied recently may be cheap in tangible book value but aren't the ones to own, Keefe Bruyette says, favoring JPMorgan Chase (JPM +1%) and U.S. Bancorp (USB +1.6%), which trade at higher book values but will improve earnings this year. Bank of America (BAC) is +30% YTD, but even CEO Brian Moynihan admits it must “show the earnings progress."  

Mar. 8, 2012, 2:49 PM|Mar. 8, 2012, 12:34 PM|Just how many billion-dollar Merrill Lynch financial advisor teams can Bank of America (BAC) afford to lose? Last week, a Merrill team left and took its $1.4B in client assets with them, the latest in a string of departing producers who found doing business at BofA became impossible. Some veteran brokers say the push to get brokers to sell banking products risks serious damage to the business.  

Mar. 8, 2012, 12:34 PM|Mar. 8, 2012, 11:39 AM|Bank of America (BAC) played HAMP like a violin - mostly preventing homeowners from receiving mortgage modifications, but doing enough to reap financial rewards from the government, according to a 2nd whistleblower suit. The Obama administration last week declared BofA back in its good graces in regards to HAMP.  

Mar. 8, 2012, 11:39 AM|Mar. 7, 2012, 2:51 PM|Wells Fargo (WFC) may shut or consolidate branches as the lender - unable to replace lost revenue from a number of new financial regulations - looks to cut costs. Bank of America (BAC) is also considering same, but JPMorgan (JPM) says it is expanding its branch network - though nowhere near the scale it had previously talked about.  

Mar. 7, 2012, 2:51 PM|Mar. 6, 2012, 10:49 AM|Bank bonds are crushed in early trading, as the risk premium on intermediate term notes from Morgan Stanley, UBS and Goldman widen 0.14, 0.22, and 0.35 percentage points, respectively, and short-term paper from BofA and US Bancorp weaken 0.16 and 0.24 points.

Mar. 2, 2012, 3:45 PM|Mar. 1, 2012, 5:32 PM|Bank of America (BAC) is denying reports that it is testing plans to charge customers for keeping a checking account: "Media reports this morning provided inaccurate information. [BofA] is not planning to increase checking account fees with our existing customers." Perhaps Sen. Dick Durbin, one of the bank's harshest critics, will be satisfied (WSJ report).  

Mar. 1, 2012, 5:32 PM|Mar. 1, 2012, 12:27 PM|That didn't take long. Massachusetts Sec. of the Commonwealth William Galvin slams Bank of America's (BAC +2.3%) consideration of new fee structures on its checking accounts, and proposes a law barring banks from holding state deposits if they don't offer basic checking without fees.

Mar. 1, 2012, 12:27 PM|Mar. 1, 2012, 10:02 AM|Though Bank of America (BAC +1.9%) stands to become the lightning rod again for complaints on higher banking fees, other big banks are considering joining the party as they view low-fee checking a bottom-line drainer. JPMorgan (JPM +1.6%) exec Todd Maclin says the bank wants to charge customers more than its current average of $10-$12 a month, but in the current climate it won't rock that boat. Translation: Let BofA go first.          

Mar. 1, 2012, 10:02 AM|Mar. 1, 2012, 8:05 AM|Fannie Mae (FNMA.OB) disputes Bank of America's (BAC) version of events behind the end of their loan-purchase agreement, saying the decision to part ways was not mutual and that it alone chose not to renew the contract after the bank resisted demands to buy back mortgages. "Ultimately the taxpayer pays" if BofA resists, as Fannie prepares to ask the feds for another $4.6B.  

Mar. 1, 2012, 8:05 AM|Mar. 1, 2012, 3:35 AM|Bank of America (BAC) is working on plans to once again revamp its fee system, tagging some clients with monthly charges unless they agree to bank online, buy more products or maintain certain balances.

Commitments allowing the efficient delivery of such loans had expired, BofA says, and "ongoing differences with [Fannie Mae] in other contexts, including  repurchase claims" influenced the decision.

With the cost of capital less than 5%, well, you do the math. Bank of America (BAC) owns at least 1/3 of single-family RE there, and may not have taken the marks yet - something to think about the next time someone says BofA is cheap on a price/book basis.

Wells, whose $89B in Q3 loan originations dwarfed BofA's $33B, not to mention JPMorgan's (JPM) $37B, may be in line to gain market share as other major banks curtail lending due to regulatory fears and Basel capital requirements.

In a move to reduce the bank's holding company exposure, it recently moved a large tranche of its worst performing derivatives from its Merrill Lynch unit to a subsidiary flush with taxpayer insured deposits. The Fed has signaled it favors the move, but the FDIC, which will have to pay off depositors in the event of a bank failure, objects.

When asked about the fee on today’s conference call, CEO Brian Moynihan said “a lot” of customers could avoid it by keeping most of their business with the bank.

It's just a blip compared to the 14.7M cards issued in H1 2007, but the improving performance of recent credit card portfolios are making lenders more comfortable. Data suggest Citigroup (C) is leading the charge.  

Oct. 11, 2011, 3:43 PM|Oct. 11, 2011, 10:08 AM|UBS is making a bullish call on Citigroup (C), arguing the banking giant's exposure to mortgage lawsuits, Euro sovereign debt, and the U.S. housing market don't "even get halfway" to justifying its cheap valuation. On the other hand, UBS thinks Bank of America's (BAC) low valuation is justified, given its outstanding loan portfolio is in much worse shape.

Redemptions - perhaps massive ones - are a possibility, meaning Paulson will have to unload financial shares, and others, he has been so fond of. One could do worse than picking a bottom in the XLF on the day he is forced to give up on the sector.

The bank is also paying former president of consumer banking Joe Price a lump sum payment of $4.15M plus his entire year $850K salary. Being fired never sounded so good.

It will be difficult to approach that amount without California, which has more underwater borrowers than any other state.

On BofA's new $5/month debit card fee: "If somebody else offers a better deal, people can go to that. It’s just like you can change channels on television." (earlier)

Though it's not hacking or a security problem, it's an ironic end to Q3 for the period's worst Dow performer.  

Sep. 30, 2011, 12:28 PM|Sep. 30, 2011, 11:58 AM|Sen. Dick Durbin excoriates Bank of America (BAC -1.9%) for "sticking it" to debit card customers via its new $5 monthly fee: "Banks that try to make up their excess profits off the backs of their customers will finally learn how a competitive market works." But Durbin led the move to change the rules. Isn't this how a competitive market is supposed to work?  

Sep. 30, 2011, 11:58 AM|Sep. 30, 2011, 10:49 AM|The $5 debit card fee BofA (BAC -2.1%) plans to charge customers shouldn't draw their ire, argues The Atlantic's Daniel Indiviglio, as Congress is the one "gouging" American consumers. The new rule limiting the debit card fees banks can charge retailers should be revenue-neutral to consumers, but instead retailers are pocketing the difference (for now) and leaving banks looking like the bad guys.

Bank of America’s (BAC -1%) spread also is up 3% to a record 410 bp. But Morgan Stanley’s exposure, located in more dangerous forex derivative contracts rather than relatively easy-to-hedge plain vanilla interest rate swaps, is considered more troubling.           

Sep. 30, 2011, 9:46 AM|Sep. 29, 2011, 1:12 PM|Another day, another new bank fee. This time it's Bank of America (BAC +3.1%), as most of its customers will soon see a new $5 charge on their statements for any month in which they use a BofA debit card to make a purchase. The bank, like others, is considering new ways to recover debit card revenue that is going away because of new regulations.

Unlike in 2008, it's not about capital, but "a weakening macro picture and a sovereign crisis in which no clear resolution appears in sight."

Answering criticism for failing to cut more expenses like BAC and GS, Pandit says the bank will disclose more on its cost structure in Q3 earnings, and likely will give more guidance on expenses.

The report notes the settlement was inked over the objections of a senior examiner as Freddie execs claim they did not want to damage relationships with BofA. Sigh.

A WSJ report had said the fund would meet with advisers next week to discuss the idea. BofA also agrees to sell $880M in commercial real estate loans, and is negotiating to sell its stake in the biggest U.S. Pizza Hut franchisee for ~$800M.

BofA inherited NPC when it took over Merrill Lynch in 2009. Sources say the sale price could be more than $800M, but an analyst calculates the value as between $630-$735M.  

Sep. 22, 2011, 4:41 PM|Sep. 22, 2011, 12:05 PM|Bank of America (BAC) shouldn't trade at $5 based on its book, of course - but logic has little to do with what's happening, Bruce Krasting writes. "There is no TARP option this time around. The TBTF argument has been decided. Failure will be permitted... Another Lehman-type event is staring us in the face.

Thornburg Investment's Jason Brady also thinks BofA won't be allowed to fail due to its symbolic value being much bigger than Lehman's.

Peter Tchir doesn't think yesterday's downgrade is a huge deal, but notes at the margin, firms will be less inclined to trade with a lower-rated counterparty, and - more importantly - could cut their trade lines with the bank.

Sep. 21, 2011, 5:16 PM|Sep. 21, 2011, 4:05 PM|Market recap: Operation Twist worked in pushing down long-term yields in the wake of the FOMC announcement, but stocks nosedived and the dollar soared as investors apparently wanted more. Banks, already skidding after debt downgrades of BAC, C and WFC (I, II, III), fell further. Europe was quiet, for a change. NYSE decliners overwhelmed advancers five to one.

Sep. 21, 2011, 12:56 PM|Sep. 21, 2011, 12:30 PM|Bank of America (BAC -3.2%) is downgraded by Moody's to Baa1 from A2.

The move - sure to be well-received by customers who love their debit card perks - isn't quite altruistic considering unregulated credit card swipe fees generate a cool $40B a year for banks and cardholders will pay interest if they carry a balance.           

Sep. 19, 2011, 4:05 PM|Sep. 19, 2011, 4:04 PM|FDIC chief Martin Gruenberg thinks banks need to lend more, for their own sake. While profits have been surging, much of the growth has come from reduced loan-loss provisions. In Q2, these reductions boosted BAC's profits by $2.5B, and C's by $2.2B. But as provisions reach historical norms, banks will need to lend to increase their bottom lines.

The numbers suggest a new rush of foreclosed properties coming to market and a reversal of recent marginally positive house price data.  

Sep. 14, 2011, 8:05 AM|Sep. 13, 2011, 6:45 PM|Bank of America (BAC) is ramping up its foreclosure processing again, having sent out far more notices of default to borrowers in August than in previous months. Delays in processing artificially lowered foreclosure numbers over the past year due to the "robo-signing" scandal, so this new surge likely addresses loans that have been long delinquent.

Those who believe massive liabilities could force the bank under or into an unfavorable capital raise fail to appreciate these costs are borne out over time, and BofA still makes $10B/quarter in pre-tax profits with which to bear them.

Oct. 26, 2010, 7:36 AM|Oct. 25, 2010, 4:05 PM|Market recap: Stocks moved higher as the weak dollar boosted materials but pared gains, with big banks slumping as Bank of America's foreclosure woes weighed on sentiment. The dollar sank near 2010 lows after the inconclusive G-20 meeting, which was widely viewed as a reason to bet the dollar would continue to fall. Gold and oil rose. NYSE gainers led decliners three to two.           

Oct. 25, 2010, 4:05 PM|Oct. 25, 2010, 2:34 PM|The relentless selling in Bank of America (BAC -2.9%) reminds of Joe Weisenthal of pre-crisis days and suggests that "the market knows something or thinks something that nobody can voice about how bad this will get." Shares hit session lows after FDIC chair Sheila Bair says the foreclosure mess reveals "critical flaws" in the system that will require a "global solution."

Oct. 25, 2010, 11:54 AM|Oct. 25, 2010, 7:40 AM|After reviewing less than 1% of the first foreclosure files it plans to resubmit to court, BofA (BAC) has found several "minor" errors, including misspellings of borrowers' names and a missing digit on an address. Minor indeed, but the real question is whether the errors in the other 99% of the files will be similarly innocuous.           

Oct. 25, 2010, 7:40 AM|Oct. 22, 2010, 4:51 PM|Philly Fed President Charles Plosser reiterates his QE2 reservations (earlier), but perhaps more interesting is his admission of an inherent conflict facing the New York Fed in its lawsuit against Bank of America (BAC) regarding mortgage putbacks: pursuing its legal obligations while ensuring financial stability.

BofA wants to unload its 34% stake in Blackrock since financial regulatory changes will force banks to  increase capital, he says.

Oct. 22, 2010, 7:49 AM|Oct. 21, 2010, 5:55 PM|The top mortgage lenders and servicers are so big and unmanageable, Jonathan Weil writes, that the people in charge of running them have no way to know the extent of the foreclosure problem. "One of the lessons the public should have learned [from the subprime mortgage crisis] is that the leaders of these companies often have no idea what’s going on inside them."  

Oct. 21, 2010, 5:55 PM|Oct. 21, 2010, 4:05 PM|Market recap: Stocks swung between gains and losses before edging higher thanks to a batch of encouraging earnings reports. Bank of America again dragged financials lower, and commodity producers sank after a dollar rebound. Demand for Treasurys declined, pushing yield on the 10-year note to 2.55%. NYSE decliners outnumbered advancers three to two.           

Oct. 21, 2010, 4:05 PM|Oct. 21, 2010, 2:32 PM|Weakness in Bank of America (BAC -3.1%) is trying to tell us that the market is "frothy" and can't sustain a meaningful rally as long as banks are a ball-and-chain, Guy Adami says. For those who argue that BofA weakness is all about the  put-backs, the stock was weak before the issue moved to the headlines.           

Oct. 21, 2010, 2:32 PM|Oct. 21, 2010, 8:43 AM|The NY Fed faces an inherent conflict of interest over its push for mortgage buybacks, as the move would simultaneously help recover taxpayer money while running counter to the Fed's goal of stabilizing the banking sector.           

Oct. 21, 2010, 8:43 AM|Oct. 20, 2010, 3:34 PM|Some options traders are betting that Bank of America (BAC +0.2%) could fall to $2.50 by 2013, based on recent trading patterns. BofA has rebuffed repurchasing securitized mortgages, but Steven Sears says that matters little in the markets; it will trade like a litigation stock until the matter is settled, and headlines will heavily influence options and stock trading indefinitely.           

Oct. 20, 2010, 3:34 PM|Oct. 20, 2010, 9:22 AM|"I have no interest in bank stocks these days," Jim Rogers tells CNBC. Balance sheets at banks are "full of rotten stuff:" "Nobody knows what book value at BofA (BAC) is, including BofA," he says.

We will examine every avenue to vigorously defend ourselves."           

Oct. 20, 2010, 7:15 AM|Oct. 19, 2010, 6:30 PM|It certainly sounds serious: The New York Fed and big firms go after Bank of America (BAC) over mortgage putbacks. But is it really? Zero Hedge declares it "a groundbreaking development," the kind of misrepresentation that could destroy mortgage originators and servicers. But Yves Smith thinks it's little more than an "empty threat."  

Oct. 19, 2010, 6:30 PM|Oct. 19, 2010, 4:05 PM|Market recap: Stock losses accelerated on heightened mortgage concerns after a report that a consortium may force Bank of America to buy back $47B of mortgage bonds. Tech stocks were hit hard on disappointing results from Apple and IBM. The dollar jumped and commodities tumbled on China's interest rate hike. On the NYSE, decliners routed advancers more than five to one.

Oct. 19, 2010, 2:23 PM|Oct. 19, 2010, 2:11 PM|Dick Bove still rates Bank of America (BAC) a buy, despite near-term difficulties due to weakness in its consumer divisions, citing BofA's current market cap that's below the cash on its balance sheet. He also rates Goldman Sachs (GS) a buy: "Everything you would look at to determine where its stock might be going in the fourth quarter and beyond is positive."           

Oct. 19, 2010, 2:11 PM|Oct. 19, 2010, 9:23 AM|Monday's moves by Bank of America (BAC) and GMAC to restart foreclosures are part of a growing counterattack by lenders against allegations that they improperly reviewed foreclosure documents. Most claims “don’t have the defects that people allege,” CEO Brian Moynihan says. There's no sign that BofA is socking away tons of cash to cover a looming wave of mortgage repurchases.

Other banks riding the wave: WFC +5.5%, BAC +3%, JPM +2.9%. Crude jumped as the dollar slipped -0.3% against yen, -0.1% against euro.

Oct. 18, 2010, 4:05 PM|Oct. 18, 2010, 3:41 PM|Bank of America (BAC +2.7%) says it's applying new signatures to foreclosures in 23 states and will resubmit to courts by next Monday, meaning that foreclosure sales can resume in November. The bank says it's found "no cases" of foreclosures that shouldn't have gone through - and expects delays on fewer than 30,000 foreclosure sales nationwide.           

Oct. 18, 2010, 3:41 PM|Oct. 18, 2010, 12:12 PM|Angelo Mozilo's agreement to disgorge $45M of profits and pay a $22.5M penalty to settle a securities fraud charge sounds like a real hit to his wallet. But it's less than it appears, because the amount he ultimately must pay represents only a small part of the $500M-plus he made while CEO at Countrywide (BAC) - and BofA is on the hook for $20M of the disgorgement.  

Oct. 18, 2010, 12:12 PM|Oct. 16, 2010, 2:32 PM|BofA (BAC) said the costs of foreclosure delays have been "grossly distorted," but Dick Bove isn't convinced. He thinks banks could face losses of more than $80B, not so much because of a halt in foreclosures but because of the investor and homeowner lawsuits that will almost certainly follow.

Oct. 15, 2010, 4:27 PM|Oct. 15, 2010, 12:12 PM|The S&P 500 turned positive for a bit around today's Fed open market operations, but has slipped back into the red (-0.2%, to 1,171) - and the Dow's lower still, weighed down by GE (GE -5.1%) after its report of 5% lower revenue. Banks are tanking for a second day: BAC -4.3%, JPM -3.2%, WFC -3.2%, C -1.9%.

In sectors, financials suffered as stacked-up bad foreclosure news weighed on banks: C -4.2%, BAC -5.2%, JPM -3.2%, WFC -4.2%. The dollar was pummeled (-0.9% against euro, -0.4% against yen) and the long-bond auction was weak. Gold touched a new high of $1,383.90.

Oct. 14, 2010, 11:49 AM|Oct. 14, 2010, 9:54 AM|Big bank debt and equity are slammed in early trading, as news of more firms halting foreclosures weighs on the market. The gap between U.S. debt and five- and 10-year debt widens for Bank of America (BAC -3.2%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM -2.2%) and Citigroup (C -2.8%) on concern that slowing foreclosures "will keep deteriorating assets on their books."

The banks are "obsessed" with the political pressure being brought to bear, he says, and “amidst the investigations, they have to do a moratorium."

Nancy Pelosi and dozens of other lawmakers ask the Justice Department to investigate the nation's largest mortgage lenders, citing BofA (BAC) and JPMorgan (JPM) by name.

Texas foreclosures don't require a court order, but the attorney general's scrutiny could have a huge impact on borrowers and lenders.  

Oct. 5, 2010, 1:01 PM|Oct. 4, 2010, 2:22 PM|October may bring more of a trick than a treat to investors, Bank of America's (BAC) Mary Ann Bartels believes, citing weakening short-term price momentum indicators in the face of continuing low volume.

Losses in Citigroup (C -1.4%) and BofA (BAC -2.3%) are accelerating into the final hour; Lincoln National (LNC -2.9%) is among the S&P biggest decliners. The Financial Sector SPDR ETF (XLF -1.5%) has shed 7%+ in August on signs the economy has hit another soft patch.           

Aug. 30, 2010, 2:58 PM|Aug. 24, 2010, 2:22 PM|Bank of America (BAC -1.4%) shares drop to a 52-week low despite Brian Moynihan’s share purchase. Among possible reasons, the Fed told BofA to increase tangible equity by $3B by year's end; the bank has raised $1.9B so far in asset sales but could need to raise the rest through stock sales, which would be dilutive.

Aug. 16, 2010, 7:42 AM|Aug. 13, 2010, 2:47 PM|Financial-company stocks are attractive for the first time in months, Doug Kass says; he's been buying Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C), and he likes insurance companies such as Prudential (PRU) and Lincoln National (LNC). But overall, the economy and the market is "constrained and mired by this vortex of liquidity, tax and regulatory  traps."           

Aug. 13, 2010, 2:47 PM|Aug. 11, 2010, 10:23 AM|Piqued by new disclosures of Merrill Lynch's (BAC) techniques of hiding leverage and losses, Barry Ritholtz thinks we may finally begin to see some "justice" to perpetrators of Wall Street fraud. "When this all plays out, we might very well see bonus clawbacks, fines and penalties, disgorgement of ill gotten gains, and criminal arrests."           

Aug. 11, 2010, 10:23 AM|Aug. 10, 2010, 8:04 AM|BofA (BAC) may add $13B to its book value: The lockup on its 11% stake in China Construction Bank ends in less than a year, so the stake, previously valued at original cost of $9.2B, will likely be reported in the bank's Q3 earnings report with its current market value of $22.9B.

Still, financials overall haven't been hurting: up 3% as a sector in the past three months, vs. the S&P 500's -0.6%.

With its dominant U.S. banking business and attractive brokerage operations, BofA should be able to earn good returns in a better economy, even as it shifts away from its reliance on consumer fees.           

Aug. 1, 2010, 4:15 PM|Jul. 31, 2010, 3:56 PM|BofA (BAC) moves to cut rates on some certificates of deposit, with its five-year CD dropping to 1.75% from 2.25% and its three-year CD dropping to 1.1% from 1.5%. "When Bank of America moves, everybody shakes," warns Dan Geller of Market Rates Insight, a firm that tracks bank interest-rate data.

Jul. 26, 2010, 2:21 PM|Jul. 26, 2010, 9:45 AM|One lesson from earnings season so far: Now is not the time for optimistic CEOs to talk about an expansion push right around the corner. Talk of increasing capacity by Texas Instruments (TXN) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) last week was a turnoff.

NYSE advancers led decliners three to two. Gold slipped to a two-month low, and oil and the dollar fell.           

Jul. 19, 2010, 4:05 PM|Jul. 16, 2010, 4:05 PM|Market recap: Stocks started slowly and slid steadily through the day, battered by weak revenues from BofA (BAC -9.1%) and Citigroup (C -6%) and a big drop in consumer confidence. The plunge in financials was steep but the drop was broad-based, with declining issues leading advancers by at least seven to one. Treasurys finished the week on a high note, with the 10-year yield slipping below 3%, and crude oil fell to $76.           

Jul. 16, 2010, 4:05 PM|Jul. 16, 2010, 2:27 PM|Bank of America's (BAC -8.7%) "brutal honesty" in saying new financial regulations, particularly on debit-card fees, may trigger a $10B charge sparks speculation that rival banks have underestimated their own costs. “It’s regulating a transaction between two businesses,” CFO Charles Noski said in its conference call. “This isn’t going to benefit consumers at all.” V -4.4%, MA -5.6%, AXP -4.1%, C -5.1%, WFC -5.1%, JPM -3.4%.

Jul. 16, 2010, 12:15 PM|Jul. 16, 2010, 10:25 AM|Bank of America (BAC -6.1%) disappoints with lackluster performance across nearly all business lines - a troubled mortgage business, declining trading profits and a U.K. bonus tax all dragged on Q2 results. In addition, the bank said it faces more than $10B in costs related to the just-passed financial bill. Investment banking profits also were down, a  bleak sign for Goldman (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), which report next week.
