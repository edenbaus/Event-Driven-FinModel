What's likely to be a strong Q1 is already priced in, says analyst Charles Peabody, and his outlook for the rest of the year is for very little EPS growth.The stock's nearly doubled over the past nine months, but a lot of that was thanks to higher interest rates, and that's been priced in as well. Interest rate normalization affects costs as well, and those might double under the new regime.Helping to support shares could be aggressive buybacks.His $20 price target suggests more than 20% downside from the current $25.33.BAC +0.6% today|Yesterday, 2:33 PM|Banks head lower following rate hike

The major averages, bonds, and gold have all turned higher after the Fed lifted the Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points, but satiated bank bulls might be lightening up just a hair.After all, the "dots" showed the Fed as being no more hawkish than a couple of meetings back when it surprised the world by predicting three rate hikes this year. Inflation and growth expectations were essentially unchanged as well.So while the Fed may have been faster with a rate hike than many expected just a couple of weeks back, it appears the timetable past today remains the same.KBE -0.15%, KRE -0.1%, XLF flatJanet Yellen's press conference is just getting underway.Bank of America (BAC -0.2%), Citigroup (C -0.6%), JPMorgan (JPM +0.3%), Wells Fargo (WFC +0.1%), Goldman Sachs (GS +0.1%), U.S. Bancorp (USB +0.3%), PNC Financial (PNC -0.4%), KeyCorp (KEY +0.2%), Regions Financial (RF), SunTrust (STI -1%), Fifth Third (FITB -0.7%)ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, BTO, IYG, FNCL, SEF, FXO, RYF, FINU, RWW, XLFS, FINZ, JHMF, FAZZ, FNCF|Thu, Mar. 9, 12:19 PM|Bureaucracy 1, Dodd-Frank reformers 0

"Some people have come close to calling [buybacks] un-American - characterizing them as corporate misdeeds that divert funds needed for productive endeavors,” says Warren Buffett. "That simply isn't the case." If anything, he says, American corporations and private investors have too much cash looking to be "sensibly deployed." If anybody knows of an enticing project that's died for lack of capital of late, please drop a dime to Omaha, he urges.Where The Oracle does have an issue with buybacks are when corporate chiefs pay too much them. This isn't the case for Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), he says, where repurchased shares have been underpriced. Berkshire's (BRK.A, BRK.B) $5B preferred stake in BofA carries warrants allowing the purchase of 700M shares of common any time prior to Sept. 2021. While Buffett has said he's not planning on exercising until shortly before expiration, he now says he would exchange early into the common should the annual dividend (now $0.30 per share) rise to $0.44.He spends a sizable section of the letter attacking money-management fees. "When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients ... If a statue is ever erected to honor the person who has done the most for American investors, the hands down choice should be Jack Bogle."There's  still a few months to go, but Buffett also declares victory in his crisis-era bet that the S&P 500 would outperform a portfolio of funds of hedge funds over a 10-year period. Since, the compounded annual return for the S&P 500 has been 7.1% vs. 2.2% for the funds.

 The Fed votes to adopt a bailout prevention rule that will force big banks to issue substantial amounts of new long-term debt, largely upholding a draft issued early this year. Half of the eight largest U.S. banks would need to issue ~$70B in fresh debt or equity to satisfy the new Total Loss Absorbing Capacity standard, the Fed estimates. In all, the Fed says U.S. banks’ funding costs would increase by $680M-$2B annually, higher than the upper estimate of $1.5B in its October 2015 proposal. Fed officials do not identify the four banks that lack sufficient debt; Wells Fargo (WFC +1.6%) said in November it envisioned issuing at least an additional $29B in debt to satisfy the rule.

Both Allison and Hoenig are fans of following simple leverage ratios, but Tarullo says just focusing on those is "inadequate and dangerous."Tarullo's voice will also have to rise above that of Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum led by Blackstone's Stephen Schwarzman.XLF +1.15%, KRE +1.1%, KBE +1.25%Bank of America (BAC +2.6%), Wells Fargo (WFC +1.4%), JPMorgan (JPM +1.6%), Citigroup (C +2.3%), Goldman Sachs (GS +2.1%), U.S. Bancorp (USB +1%), Regions Financial (RF +1.5%), Synovus (SNV +1.1%), SunTrust (STI +1.4%), Primerica (PRI +2.1%), Bank of New York (BNY +1.4%), State Street (STT +1.1%)|Dec. 2, 2016, 11:51 AM|Banks retreat along with rates; REITs rise

 To finance its $85B deal for Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) -- half of which is coming in cash -- AT&T's (NYSE:T) invited its "relationship banks" to join a $40B bridge loan, at around three ticket levels, Bloomberg reports. Based on ratings of Baa1/BBB+ (and AT&T's ratings are on negative watch at the credit rating firms), the loan pricing may open at L+112.5 basis points, with a 10 bp commitment fee, and upfront fees of 20-30 bps. The company has BofA Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) on board to help finance the deal, though a $30B bond to help fund the deal won't be rushed as doubts remain about whether it will be completed. There's no reason to finance early given that ambiguity, a senior banker says. CreditSight analysts: "The merger may ultimately not be approved ... we feel the odds are around 50/50 at this stage." Some three-quarters of the financing is expected to take place in the investment-grade market.

The bank's strong Q3 may have already been discounted by the market, which sent BAC higher by 17% over the past three months. Strong trading results were reported by JPMorgan and Citigroup on Friday, so few were surprised when BofA showed the same this morning (Global Markets net income rose 34% Y/Y).As for deposits and lending, average total deposits rose 6% Y/Y, and average total loans and leases gained 3%. Net interest income edged higher, with net interest yield up 4 basis points from a year ago and flat from last quarter at 2.23%. The banks says a 100 basis point parallel shift in interest rates would benefit NII by $5.3B over the next 12 months - no small amount given $10.2B of NII in Q3, and overall Q3 income of $5B.See earnings call presentation slidesWhile credit loss provisions rose from year-ago levels, they were off nicely from Q1 and Q2.Noninterest expense fell to $13.5B in Q3 from $13.9B a year ago, with personnel costs down 2% and non-personnel costs off 5%.

Customers of offerings like JPMorgan's (NYSE:JPM) Sapphire Reserve card can't believe their good fortune, but bank shareholders can't be faulted for wondering whether there's going to be any profits from the growing rewards war."You have five or six big national players and they are going around killing one another," says Oppenheimer's Chris Kotowski.It's the banking version of a loss leader.

The change has to do with how Bank of America (BAC -0.5%) accounts for some MBS it owns, and brings its accounting inline with many of its peers.
The bank's previous method boosted reported net interest income in times of rising rates, but cut it when rates fell. The new method will smooth that.
In Q2, for instance, writes the WSJ's Michael Rapoport, BofA said pretax earnings were reduced by $974M thanks to "market-related adjustments" as long rates fell. A year earlier, those adjustments added $669M because rates rose.
Under the new rules, those costs will be accounted for over the lives of the securities (the way most banks already do it) and the "market-related adjustments" line will go away.

With extra ammunition given to the "break up the banks crowd," this is no longer a negligible risk.
Wells Fargo has enjoyed special status compared to the other mega banks since the financial crisis, says Seiberg, but "life [is] about to get worse" for Warren Buffett's favorite. The bank, says Seiberg, will no longer get the benefit of the doubt. "[The] fall from golden child to problem child can be difficult and expensive."

Having covered bank stocks on and off since 1985, the team at Oppenheimer says portfolio managers have never been fans of the sector, but the hatred today is off the charts - even as the reasons for that hatred have gone away.
Banks used to be opaque, they overpaid for acquisitions, and often had frothy growth that almost invariably backfired. It's hard to say that today. While banks will always be somewhat opaque, today they're returning capital rather than blowing it on acquisitions, and their "growth initiatives are the epitome of financial probity."
Oppenheimer's six large bank composite has on average churned out quarterly pretax earnings of $31.4B per quarter since 2013 (including $30.5B in Q1 this year, and $33.4B in Q2). That's a lot of money, especially since most of it is being used to buy back stock at less than 10x earnings and below tangible book value.
While lower-for-longer interest rates will continue to hamper earnings, banks are managing appropriately for the current environment, and the math of buying back stock below book will eventually win the day.
Favorite picks are Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).

Citi's Keith Horowitz notes 3% revenue growth in Q2 represents the best quarter for that metric since Q4 of 2012. Core expenses fell on a year-over-year basis for the 17th consecutive quarter.
While it was a "noisy" quarter, Nomura's Steven Chubak notes fee income and the efficiency ratio were positive surprises, while core net interest income and credit costs were inline. This quarter's resetting of interest rate expectations (lower for longer) and curve flattening could put a damper on any positive EPS estimates for H2 and 2017, but Chubak suspects the stock price at 82% of tangible book value has already discounted this.
Speaking on the earnings call, CEO Brian Moynihan says Bank of America (BAC +1.9%) doesn't need higher interest rates to grow earnings. Expense cuts and plans to grow fee income can do the job for now.

While nearly all major U.S. banks cruised through the stress tests last month, writes David Schawel, those exams are about determining if lenders have enough capital to get through a crisis, not whether they can earn the sort of risk-adjusted returns of the past.
On this front (for insurers as well as banks), there's plenty more for investors to worry about, he says, thanks to the vanishing spread between short rates (what the companies pay on their liabilities), and long rates (what they earn on their assets).
A new Fed study finds the adverse effect of weaker net interest margins is materially larger when rates are low. The reason: The lower bound of funding costs is zero as institutions are reticent to charge negative rates.
Investors interested in buying banks or insurers because of seemingly cheap valuations might want to look again. Bank multiples, says Schawel, typically move alongside ROE, and serious improvement in ROE is unlikely with rates remaining low.

Citigroup (C -0.6%) is notably lower despite announcing more than a tripling in the dividend. Bank of America (BAC -0.8%) was more cautious with its payout boost, but is faring about the same.

The percentage of Americans with subprime credit scores fell to 20.7% in April, the sixth consecutive year-over-year decline, and the lowest level since at least 2005 when FICO started tracking the data.
The level peaked at 25.5% in 2010.
The improving trend means revenue-squeezed banks can boost lending without lowering standards. "It will have a positive impact on loan volume, loan growth and revenue,” says Morgan Whitacre, a consumer client underwriting executive at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
Alongside rising credit scores are near-record lows for defaults. Just 0.81% of consumer loan dollars - including mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards - were in default in May, the lowest level on records going back to 2004. This peaked at 5.51% in 2009.
The result: Consumers are starting to borrow more again ... a good thing until it isn't anymore. Jamie Dimon (NYSE:JPM) earlier in June called the auto-lending market "a little stretched," and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) just lifted its forecast for credit losses in the coming year.

Bond-trading revenue at Jefferies was up 55%, the largest quarterly gain since 2014, and the best Mar-May quarter since 2012. Wall Street executives for a few weeks have touted a Q2 trading rebound, and the news from Jefferies backs that up.

Worrying analysts though is that customers like the one above - his family has nine Wells products - appear to have had their fill, writes Ben McLannahan in the FT. Wells' lauded cross-sell ratio has fallen from an average of 6.36 products per household in Dec. 2013 to 6.29 a the end of last year."
While the bank trades at a premium to U.S. peers in terms of multiple of net assets, that premium has shrunk to half the level of two years ago, and Wells recently cut some financial targets.
Without a big rise in interest rates, says Standard Life's Chris Haimendorf, "it is very difficult to see how things can get even better from here."

In separate public comments today, Fed governors Daniel Tarullo and Jerome Powell said the Fed will require the eight largest U.S. banks to hold even more capital if they want to pass stress tests.
The goal, says Powell, is to make capital requirements so difficult that the largest lenders have to honestly assess whether it would be a better idea to break themselves up.
For now, the Fed is going to make 2015's capital surcharges permanent, which alone makes things tougher. "Really quite significant, probably the most significant additional potential capital requirement on the horizon." says former OCC Director John Dugan.

About half of all share sales by public companies this year have been block trades, writes Corrie Driebusch, versus an average of about one-third over the past five years, and just one-fifth over the past decade.
To review, a block trade involves a bank buying a large chunk of stock from a company or its P-E backers at a discount, in the hopes of unloading it piece-by-piece later that day at a markup.
The increase in block trades, of course, comes as business slows at any number of other bank profit centers, particularly fixed-income trading.

"The days of negative provisioning are pretty much dead," says D.A. Davidson's Kevin Reevey. "Now, they're going to have to take provisioning expense and build up reserves based on loan growth."
Total bank loan loss reserves were north of $250B in Q1 2010, before falling to about $24B at the end of last year. Amid the energy crash, they edged higher in Q1. Naturally, those lenders with the most exposure to energy posted some of the largest reserve increases in Q1. "It wasn't just the levels that [oil] went to, it was the speed at which prices dropped," says Peter Guilfoile, chief credit officer at one of those banks - Comerica (NYSE:CMA). Colorado-based National Bank Holdings (NYSE:NBHC) posted the largest Q/Q increase in reserves-to-loans, jumping 39 basis points to 1.43%.
Meanwhile, there were plenty of other banks which actually saw declines in that ratio, notably Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB). These and other lenders in that bucket can thank denominator of that ratio growing quickly enough to offset reserve builds.

“They keep making it more difficult to be a big bank,” says a D.C. attorney.
At those lenders with more than $250B in assets, top management would have 60% of their bonuses deferred for four years. Tough, but even tougher are clawback provisions allowing banks to take back money up to seven years after bonuses vest.
Though mammoth in size, the overwhelming majority of assets at BlackRock and the like are client, not proprietary assets. Thus, they aren't subject to the same restrictions. Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN), for instance, has $743B in AUM, but only about $16B of its own assets. Blackstone (NYSE:BX) manages $344B, but only $22B of its own money.

Managing Director Megan Messina filed suit last night, accusing Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) of "egregious pay disparity," and of condoning bias by her superior which made her feel unwelcome in a "bro's club" of sycophants. She also accuses the bank of violating Dodd-Frank whistleblower protects by suspending her for complaining about illegal activity.
Among the details: Her boss treated her "like a summer intern," spent more time with the other structured products chief, banned her from client events, and peppered her with questions like "have your eyes always been that blue?"
As for illegal activity, she says her counterpart engaged in "front running" by buying bonds for BofA despite knowing clients wanted them.

Value-at-risk at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) jumped 50% amid Q1's volatility, reports Bloomberg.

What's the bank doing to get more efficient, asked 9th-grader Natalie Clarke of Bank of America (BAC -0.9%) CEO Brian Moynihan at the annual meeting this week. BofA, of course, has a notoriously high efficiency ratio (like in golf, high isn't good).
Clarke is the owner of 5K shares of Bank of America given to her as a baby, and at previous annual meetings has queried about her father who got laid off and about pay for women. This year she got serious: "You and I are looking at some pretty bad numbers," she told Moynihan. BofA is about flat since Moynihan took over, and sells for just two-thirds of book value. Its 11% decline in 2016 stands against just a 3.5% fall in the KBW Bank Index, and is worse than its big bank peers.
As for Clarke's holdings, she got her shares in 2002 when BofA was a $34 stock, more than double today's price.
“There’s a perception that you guys shine your shoes, go to work and wait for interest rates to rise,” said the considerably older Mike Mayo at the meeting. Mayo later said Clarke's questions did a good job of summarizing the concerns of bank investors.

Also, no surprise, owners rejected a "clawback" proposal in which the bank could have held onto a substantial portion of the pay of executives for at least 10 years.
Among the speakers was analyst Mike Mayo, who criticized the board's independent members for not holding CEO Brian Moynihan and team more accountable for hitting financial targets. He called the compensation proposal "extra pay for management."
Mayo upgraded BofA to Outperform about three months ago, arguing the cheap valuation and strong balance sheet made the stock a buy despite poor corporate governance.

|Apr. 19, 2016, 1:29 PM|Goldman team still bullish on big banks


Having had some time to digest weak, but better-than-hoped Q1 results for the nation's largest lenders, Goldman analyst Richard Ramsden remains bullish on the likes of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).
He notes NIMs expanded - meaning banks held onto most of the benefit from the Fed's December rate hike. Cost-cutting programs are beginning to bear fruit, with 9% Y/Y cuts in compensation costs, and 3% declines in non-comp expenses.
As for energy, provisions made for a 9% drag on EPS, but reserves now stand at 6% of funded energy loans, or 11% of E&P oilfield service loans.
Ramsden is looking for robust loan and deposit growth for the rest of this year.
His favorite name is Bank of America with a $17 price target (vs. current $14.39). The stock trades at 10.5x 2016 earnings, but probably has the most sensitivity to higher rates, and the most core and non-core expense leverage.
|Apr. 14, 2016, 10:32 AM|BofA turns higher following earnings and call


Living will: The fixes are "completely doable," says CFO Paul Donofrio, addressing yesterday's rejection of his bank's wind-down plan.
Return on assets: ROA slipped to 0.5% in Q1 from 0.6% a quarter earlier - just half of CEO Brian Moynihan's goal of 1%. Moynihan tells callers interest rates will have to rise before that level can be reached.
Mobile still growing fast: The bank in Q1 had 19.6M active users of its mobile banking services, up 15% from a year ago. 16% of deposits are now done through mobile devices. On branch cuts, management says they are consolidating into larger branches, and the new ones look more like a sales office than a traditional branch. Donofrio: “I think the branches are not going to be places where people come to transact. They’re going to come for a product they need because something changed in their life."
Expenses: The efficiency ratio improved, but it's still a whopping 75% vs. peers in the mid-to-high 50s. Moynihan wants to at least get it down to the low-60s. Pressed on expenses by Mike Mayo, Donofrio says the bank is splitting cost savings between future growth and the bottom line. "It's a lever we can pull over an extended period of time."

JPMorgan's revenues and profits both fell from a year ago, but the lame performance of the banks thus far this year has already priced in a weak quarter. JPMorgan is higher by 3.8%, with Citigroup (C +4.7%), Bank of America (BAC +3.5%), Wells Fargo (WFC +1.7%), Goldman Sachs (GS +2.9%), and Morgan Stanley (MS +4.4%) joining the party. The XLF is higher by 1.75% vs. the S&P 500's 0.7% advance.
But what about all of these players (except for Citi) having their living wills rejected by the Fed, FDIC, or both? A sideshow, no doubt. Regulators are going to regulate - like the commercial goes, "It's what they do." Banks will tweak plans, numbers, or whatever they need to in order to get D.C. to eventually sign off.

Regulators were split on Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), with the FDIC giving Goldman a thumbs down, but the Fed not, and just the opposite for Morgan.
Citigroup (NYSE:C) is the only one of the major banks not to have their plan rejected, though both the Fed and FDIC found "shortcomings" that need to be addressed by July 2017.

At least half of the eight U.S. banks labeled "systemically important" are expected to receive "harsh verdicts" regarding their so-called living wills, sending them scrambling to revise plans about how they would handle a potential bankruptcy, WSJ reports.
The move, which could come as soon as this week, would raise the prospect of higher capital requirements or other regulatory sanctions for some of the institutions, and underscore fears that the firms remain "too big to fail" without a taxpayer bailout.

“Let’s not sugarcoat it, this is not necessarily a loan a bank wants to make at this point,” says Evercore ISI's Glenn Schorr, talking about loans banks have committed to for energy companies, but upon which those firms have not yet drawn.In Q1, energy borrowers announced draws of more than $3B on these loans, saddling banks with maybe more exposure to the sector than they or their investors would like right now.Citigroup (NYSE:C), for example, has about $20B in funded energy loan exposure, but commitments for nearly another $40B. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has loans of just over $20B and commitments for another $20B-plus. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), SunTrust (NYSE:STI), Comerica (NYSE:CMA), Regions Financial (NYSE:RF), and KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) are showing similar stories (though mostly smaller amounts).

Focusing on "too big to fail" is too narrow a lens with which to analyze and make decisions about bank size and concentration, says the team at KBW, taking note of increased chatter of late about a forced breakup of the nation's largest lenders.
Returns are part of the mix too, and if they're poor at the mega-banks, this limits credit creation in the economy - a signal, says KBW, that companies must "radically restructure" to get their stock prices above at least tangible book value.
Looking at the stock prices of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C) during the past five years, KBW says Wells has traded above TBV throughout the time period - suggesting the bank is consistently creating returns above its cost of capital. Citi, on the other hand, has not traded above TBV for the whole period - "a clear market signal that the company should consider much more radical restructuring to create profitable business that can grow."

This leaves those whose business model depends on riding the yield curve having to contend with not only a middling macro picture, but - once again - a rates lower for longer picture (although Jamie Dimon says his big fear is that markets aren't pricing in nearly enough in the way of higher rates).

"We are confident in the capital strength of the large and mid-cap banks - and with that, their capacity for increased capital returns," says Credit Suisse's Susan Roth Katzke.
Stronger balance sheets, she says, should outweigh what is a harsher adverse scenario from the Fed.
Roth and team see a total net capital return increase of 77% vs. 58% in 2015, with a median payout ratio of 31% vs. 27%. Incremental dollars should be skewed to buybacks given cheap stock valuations and the Fed's preference for the flexibility afforded by repurchases.
Best positioned for the highest capital return are Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Regions Financial (NYSE:RF), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB), PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC), and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB).
The highest incremental capital returns should come from Zions Bancorp (NASDAQ:ZION), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and M&T Bank (NYSE:MTB).
The lower end of payout ratios should fall on Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN) and Bank of America.

The Department of Labor this week is expected to release final regulations requiring brokers to act with a fiduciary standard - that is act solely in the best interest of their client. Previously, recommendations only had to be "suitable" for clients - a less rigorous standard allowing excessive fees, and investments with hidden commissions.
Investors now paying trading commissions will likely be moved into accounts where brokers collect fees based on AUM. Popular, but costly products like variable annuities, commodity pools and non-tradable REITs might no longer find a home in retirement accounts. They'll be replaced with low-cost index funds.
Whether it all works out for the little guy remains to be seen, but one thing is sure: Regulatory costs will be on the rise, something larger shops - think Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) - are going to be able to absorb better than smaller players who are more reliant on commissions - think LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) and Raymond James (NYSE:RF).
Big providers of index mutual funds and ETFs are winners as well - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW), and WisdomTree (NASDAQ:WETF) fit the bill. Active mutual fund houses like Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN), Legg Mason (NYSE:LM), and Waddell & Reed (NYSE:WDR), not so much.

Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) leads the league in fumbling stress-test submissions - three in last five years - but this year, the lender is tasking its own Winston Wolfe with tackling the job.
“She’s pretty much fearless," says former Ken Lewis executive Steele Alphin of Chief Administrative Officer Andrea Smith. "I asked her to do things that were very, very difficult to do."
Regulators have told the bank of their concern with excessive turnover in recent years of those running the test, and that the bank needs to stop viewing the CCAR as a once-a-year exercise, rather than part of a bigger-picture capital management effort. Part of Smith's job, writes Christina Rexrode, is to alleviate those concerns.
Her job leading this task is of particular interest given her human resources background. Executives at other lenders running the test typically come out of finance or risk.
"It’s kind of like an orchestra leader,” says COO Thomas Montag. "I have no idea if the orchestra leader can play any of the instruments, but if you don’t have somebody at the front providing the timing and the direction and the focus, it sounds kind of lousy.”

Return on average common equity (ROACE) is what determines the valuation of large, mature banks, says RBC's Gerard Cassidy, and those banks that cannot earn their cost of equity capital - estimated at 9-10% through the cycle - ought to consider alternative strategies, including breaking up.
The key here is interest rates, and should they remain at these levels for a prolonged period, reaching targeted ROACE will be difficult for all banks, particularly for Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C).
While a sum-of-the-parts analysis indicates value could be unlocked, the cost of doing so could be prohibitive, says Cassidy.

"Our overall Q1 results reflect an exceptionally volatile and turbulent market environment during our first fiscal quarter," says Jefferies (NYSE:LUK) CEO Richard Handler. "A quiet December was followed by an extremely challenging January and first few weeks of February."
The investment bank posted a loss of $166.8M in Q1 vs. a profit of $12.9M a year ago. Revenue of $299M fell a full 49%, led by an 82% plunge in trading revenue to $58.8M. Of this, fixed-income revenue fell to $56.8M from $126M. Equity trading revenue fell to just $1.7M from $203.5M thanks to markdowns on two equity block trades.
Good times ahead: Not only have markets stabilized, says management, they've "aggressively snapped back" in the early part of Q2.
Coming one month ahead of the rest of the Wall Street banks, Jefferies results are often seen as a bellwether of what to expect. It sounds like Goldman (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), CItigroup (NYSE:C), and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) have the month of March to make up for what was a very lame start to the quarter.

The financial sector (NYSEARCA:XLF) has performed woefully this year, and the banks (NYSEARCA:KBE) even worse. Cornerstone Macro technician Carter Worth finds twenty names trading well beneath their (falling) 150-day moving averages.
The group has shown signs of life lately, and Worth thinks the stocks could move back to their 150-day averages, as stocks in other market sectors have done.
It's strictly a trade, says Worth, who continues to rate the financials as Underweight. The 20:

While the big Wall Street banks are struggling with slides in fixed-income revenues, business is booming at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and other ETF providers offering credit-related products.
The banks, writes Lisa Abramowicz, want some of that business back.
The issue for banks are new regulatory and capital rules which make it harder to hold big inventories are paper investors want to trade. Meanwhile, the ease of moving in and out of vehicles like BlackRock's $25B IG bond fund (NYSEARCA:LQD) or its $16B junk-bond fund (NYSEARCA:HYG) have led to surging volumes, even as the individual securities underlying those ETFs are more difficult to trade.
Banks are responding with the total-return swap in which an investor pays a fee to a counterparty who promises delivery of the total gain on a basket of certain debt. These instruments are not only quickly traded without having to deal with the underlying securities, but are pegged to some of the same indexes as the biggest credit ETFs. Citigroup (NYSE:C) just became the eight dealer in these derivatives (joining GS, BAC, JPM, MS, CS, DB and OTCQX:BNPQY), which are being pitched by banks as an alternative to ETFs.
|Mar. 11, 2016, 7:19 AM|Bloomberg: BofA cuts Asia investment banking staff


Among those exiting are Wang Bing, a managing director in the China investment banking operation, and Patrick Steinemann, co-head of Asia industrials banking. At least 15 senior bankers were cut, according to Bloomberg, along with junior positions and back-office jobs.
The moves aren't a huge surprise as investment banks everywhere have been cutting jobs over the past few months, and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) in particular is focused on cost reductions.
Citigroup earlier this week said Q1 investment banking revenue is set to fall 25% from one year ago.

The two banks periodically cull their low performers, but - after an especially rough start to 2016 - cuts this year promise to be a little deeper. According to Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) will eliminate more than 5% of traders and salespeople (5% is the usual norm), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) will dismiss about 150.
"We remain committed to our FICC business, but we’re also managing to the cycle,” said Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein last month. Last week, JPMorgan's Daniel Pinto said FICC trading revenue is lower by about 20% this year.
|Mar. 3, 2016, 8:37 AM|Gross: Epic era of credit expansion ending


The global economy has been powered by credit for more than 40 years, says Bill Gross - noting official credit outstanding today of $58T is 58x that of 1970. That expansion, though, looks to be ending, as private sector savers are growing leery, and regulators build fences against fast creation. And don't forget the meager returns, with negative interest rates in 40% of Euroland, and out ten years on the curve in Japan.
The collapse in bank stocks globally isn't necessarily about energy losses. Price charts since 2007 for players like Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS), Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) suggest the sector's either a screaming cheap buy, or "a permanently damaged victim of writes-offs, tighter regulation, and significantly lower futures margins. I'll vote for the latter."
Then there's insurers, whose business models - which depend on 7-8% returns from risk assets - are at risk. They're not going bankrupt, but future profitability for companies like MetLife (NYSE:MET), Prudential (NYSE:PRU), and Hartford (NYSE:HIG) will be stifled as claims can't be covered as easily when investment returns are so lame.
The same goes or pension funds, and Puerto Rico is going down Detroit's path not just because of overpromised benefits, but because they're not earning enough on their investment portfolios to cover those promises.
Central bankers, meanwhile, think they can solve things by cutting rates just a bit further.

|Mar. 3, 2016, 7:18 AM|Timing in question as BofA makes big push into auto lending


Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) last May tapped two mortgage executives to lead the auto loan business, writes Dan Freed, and they have hired loan officers and salespeople at a fast clip since.
The timing could be deemed as curious, with regulators and competitors sending signals that the benign credit cycle of the past years has peaked.
Across the industry, banks classified $1.1B of auto loans as uncollectible in Q4. That's up 15% from a year earlier, and 39% from 2011 (though the size of the market has grown considerably since 2011).
"I'm not actively hiring or growing our operations across the platform. That's for sure," says Andrew Stuart, who heads TD Auto Finance.
Earlier this month, Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank said auto loans after the financial crisis provided "once in a lifetime type returns," but now the business has begun to lose strength.
For its part, BofA says its focused strictly on prime and "superprime" customers, and the vast majority of borrowers have credit scores above 700.

Buying IBM could be a mistake, says Warren Buffett (BRK.A, BRK.B), but he hasn't sold a share and continues to expect it to be worth more in the future (though "Charlie's neutral").
On another troubled holding, American Express (NYSE:AXP), Buffett says it's a business that has always had to adapt, and now is no different. "It's a very strong brand, but you are going to face a lot of competition on payments."
On yet another roughed-up name, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), The Oracle says CEO Brian Moynihan has done a great job after inheriting a bad hand.
Buffett is unlikely to be an owner of Dow Chemical's (NYSE:DOW) common stock, and likes the preferred more. He owns $3B of preferred from 2009 that pay an 8.5% annual dividend. Converting would amount to about 6% of the common float.
Of troubled names in general, Buffett reminds Berkshire Hathaway's stock price has dipped 50% three different times since he began controlling it. "It was terrific!" A stock going down is a good thing, unless the company itself is losing value.

In another sign of the difficulties lower-rated credits are having with borrowing, Goldman Sachs (GS +2.1%) is having a hard time moving $2B in paper backing the buyout of Solera Holdings, reports the WSJ.
Solera late last year agreed to an LBO to Vista Equity Partners for $6.5B, including debt.
The bonds backing the sale carry an especially weak Caa1 rating from Moody's, and it's in these lower-rated tranches where the worst of the high-yield carnage has taken place. Demand "is really nonexistent now," says one portfolio manager.
Goldman had hoped to unload the Solera bonds at a price to yield about 10%, but by midday yesterday had only found buyers for about half of the paper, and pricing had moved above 11%.
As painful as it is for borrowers, it's also so for the banks which earn big fees from lending commitments - great when the bonds are easy to move, but a profit eater when the stuff has so sit on the books for very long. Goldman, in particular, has sought to boost market share in this part of the business against traditional powerhouses like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).

|Feb. 24, 2016, 1:13 PM|Heard on the Street: Banks caught in ugly cycle


It's another nasty session for banks today, writes David Reilly, and the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index is now lower by almost 20% YTD, with names like Citigroup (C -2.3%) and Bank of America (BAC -2.3%) down nearly 30%.
The nasty feedback cycle begins with the crash in the oil price, which stings banks thanks to worries of big losses on energy-lending, and more broadly hurts lenders by dragging down the stocks in general. This in turn, leads to concern about a recession would further ding bank profits.
More ominous, the yield curve is flattening. Using the spread between two-year and 10-year Treasury notes isn't a bad proxy for bank profits and it's slumped to just 0.96% today. Old-timers will remember when this spread used to turn negative - a sure sign of looming recession.
The good news, says Reilly, is that the energy crash and low rates don't look to cause the sorts of losses seen in 2008. Take the long view - the cycle will someday turn.

Holding its investor day today, JPMorgan said it was going to add another $500M to energy-related loan-loss reserves. This followed a $67M provision in Q4, which at the time brought total oil and gas loss reserves to $815M (vs. a portfolio with book value of $44B).
In addition, the bank said it could need to add another $1.5B to reserves should oil hang around $25 per barrel over the next 18 months. For perspective, prior to Q4, JPMorgan hadn't had to add to reserves for six years - in fact reserve releases were a big boost to profits across the industry.
"When the biggest bank increases reserves for potential oil losses it sets a tone for the industry,” says Mike Mayo.
Separately, the FDIC says bad loan provisions across the banking sector were $3.8B higher in Q4 than a year earlier.

Just at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), employees have taken $400M in paper losses on their restricted stock paid out as bonus last year, according to the WSJ.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), BofA (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) haven't yet reported 2015 stock grants, but their share prices have been similarly hit.
Should slumping stock prices persist, it could add to the leakage of talent from Wall Street to tech and other industries, as bankers will be leaving a lot less money on the table.
The issue is a test for new Dodd-Frank rules which forced banks to tailor incentive packages towards rewarding long-term health, rather than short-term profits. The result: Banks are now more likely to award restricted shares which don't vest for several years.

Lawmakers, he says, should break up the largest banks into "smaller, less connected, less important entities." Other options would be turning the large lenders into public utilities by forcing them to hold so much capital that they can't fail, or taxing leverage throughout the financial system.

 It is the European banks and contagion concerns that are freaking out the markets today - not just the Fed, China and crude oil - according to David Rosenberg, noting that some of the European banks are trading at 2008 crisis levels after the group has tumbled 18% YTD vs. 11% for the STOXX 600 index. European financial firms are taking a beating amid fears of "a chronic profitability crisis that makes it impossible for banks to build up barely-adequate capital bases," WSJ reports.
Deutsche Bank (DB -9.8%) is down another ~10%, bringing its YTD loss to nearly 40% while its valuation has fallen to ~30% of book value, and its credit default swaps spiked to their highest levels since 2012. News of major withdrawals out of Credit Suisse (CS -4.2%) caused its shares to sink 11% last week, hitting a 24-year low, and Santander (SAN -6.2%), BBVA (BBVA -5.4%), and UniCredit (OTCPK:UNCFF -5.5%) are down to lows seen during the last eurozone financial crisis. "Oil and the flatter yield curve alone do not explain the 12% plunge we have seen in S&P Financials so far this year," Rosenberg says, adding that BofA (BAC -6.1%), Citigroup (C -6.2%) and Wells Fargo (WFC -3.5%) all briefly touched 52-week lows last week - "an ominous signpost."

Earlier: Markets extend two-day rout; gold gets 3% boost |Feb. 3, 2016, 1:00 PM|Heard on the Street: BofA too cheap


Bank of America (BAC -3.7%) has been especially punished in this year's selloff, losing 24% of its value vs. about a 13% drop in the XLF. Even though a rising rate scenario once again appears to be off the table, writes David Reilly, the stock trading at less than 60% of book value has priced in too dire of an outcome.
On last week's earnings call, the bank said it could lose $700M over the next nine quarters if oil stays at $30 per barrel, and Bernstein's John McDonald estimates losses in a stressed scenario in excess of current reserves of $1.2B - equal to just 0.5% of tangible common equity, or roughly 5% of what the bank should earn this year.
As for rates, even with a 10-year yield of just 1.75% one year ago, the bank had a NIM of 2.17% - it can still make money.
With weak returns and a need for even more aggressive cost-cutting, BofA probably deserves to sell at a discount to book value, acknowledges Reilly, but 40% is just too much.
A catalyst? Should the valuation remain this low much longer, activists are likely to boost the pressure on CEO Brian Moynihan, including calling for a potentially value-creating breakup.

The stock trades at a 20% discount to year-end estimated tangible book value of $17 per share, says CLSA's Mike Mayo. That's worse than the recessions in the early 1990s and early 2000s, despite better balance sheet strength today.
Further, the bank could grow book value even if the U.S. goes into recession.
There's also the chance BofA (BAC +1.1%) could become an "event-driven" stock, says Mayo. First, the 67% efficiency ratio is worst among the large U.S. banks, so there's plenty of room for improvement. Second, a sum-of-the parts analysis yields a result 40% higher than the current market cap. Third, shareholders are starting to speak up - while an activist is an outside shot, increased owner pressure seems likely.
He upgrades from Sell to Outperform, with price target of $16 up from (suggesting upside of less than 20%).

The stock has given up another 2.6% today, even as the broader market rallies and its TBTF peers are just modestly lower. Shares are lower by 20% YTD, and 13.4% Y/Y.
Holding court at Davos, CEO Brian Moynihan says the job cuts will continue this year after more than 10K reductions in 2015. Total headcount at the bank is 213.3K. The efficiency ratio at BofA for 2015 of 68.6% is far worse than competitors like Citigroup (57%) and Wells Fargo (57.8%)

ROTCE of 7.3% rose from 7.1%.
Addressing the oil crash, new CFO Paul Donofrio says it's more supply than demand, He knows this, he says, because if demand for energy was dropping, it would show up in the asset quality of the bank's non-energy-related loans, and this isn't happening. Donofrio says energy makes up just 2% of the bank's loan portfolio.
As for consumer benefits, CEO Brian Moynihan says spending on credit and debit cards rose 4% Y/Y, but without the oil decline, it would have risen 5.7%. Putting a dollar number on it, that's $20M per day in savings to the bank's credit and debit card customers.

Ahead of the Fed's expected rate hike later today, analyst Matt O'Connor reiterates his bullishness on Bank of America (BAC +0.5%).
"While we are not convinced a material pick up in the economy is likely anytime soon, we believe [BofA] offers good upside optionality to this without having to pay for it," says O'Connor, noting the stock's low relative valuation.
He's also impressed with the bank's focus on being the low-cost provider within the mass market for consumers, and for credit cards. The bank's earnings should be less volatile than that of peers as it's cut risk in its loan portfolio and exposure to sales and trading.

The troubles in credit mean investors need to discount those costs against the benefits of higher rates, say David George and team at Baird. In other words, downside risk to 2016/2017 EPS estimates arises not just from net interest margin compression, but also higher loan costs.
Three picks from the team: Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) at 1.1x tangible book value vs. peers at 1.35x. The $18 price target assumes just 1.05x book given weaker returns on capital and revenue growth visibility. BB&T (NYSE:BBT) trades at 11.5x 2016 estimated EPS - inline with peers, but BB&T's solid pre-provision returns, competitive positioning, and better relative capital deployment opportunities warrant a premium valuation. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) is also trading about inline with peers through it too has better relative returns and growth opportunities.

Key to the issues are the computer models the central bank uses to simulate how banks might perform during a recession. The results spewed out by these programs effectively determine the level of dividends and buybacks of the nation's large banks (not to mention the career path of bank managers).
Source: WSJ

Internal reviews found shortcomings in the Fed's system for double-checking the models - too few staff, too heavy reliance on certain key personnel, and lacking clear procedures and policies about certain aspects of the validation process. “Similar findings identified at institutions supervised by the Federal Reserve have typically been characterized as matters requiring immediate attention," according to the report.
In response, the Fed has done what most bureaucracies do - hired more staff and created a supervisory committee. Nevertheless, the findings of the reviews are likely to add fuel to calls from bankers and lawmakers for the central bank to open up the "black box" of its stress-testing models.
Among the interested parties are Citigroup (NYSE:C), which failed a stress test, and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) - all of whom have had their issues.

While ZIRP has crimped the profitability of money-market funds, the deal could wind up being a sweet one for BlackRock should rates rise, and the boosted size (AUM will rise to $372B from $285B) should bring needed efficiencies if rates don't move. "It's a challenge managing cash in a low interest-rate environment, so we have to be highly efficient," says Tom Callahan, co-head of global cash management.

 Bank of America (BAC -1.8%) has come to a $335M settlement of a lengthy federal suit where it was accused of misleading shareholders about mortgage-backed security exposure, and about its dependence on MERS, the national mortgage electronic registry. In its 10-Q filing, the bank said the $335M was fully accrued as of June 30, though the deal still needs final court approval. The suit was led by the Pennsylvania Public School Employees Retirement System, which said shareholders were misled into buying BAC stock in 2009 and 2010. It was allowed to go forward by a federal judge in July 2012. Shareholders had claimed the bank knew it couldn't raise enough capital if it revealed it had to buy back billions of dollars in securities, and that it knew MERS was so shoddy that it wouldn't be able to legally foreclose on thousands of delinquent mortgages. |Oct. 28, 2015, 12:42 PM|AIG may be activist target, but forget about the big banks


With Carl Icahn's targeting of AIG, activists are clearly climbing higher on the financial-services food chain, writes David Reilly. The goal is to make the companies small enough to not be subject to the sorts of stringent D.C. regulations associated with being too-big-to-fail.
A case in point is CIT Group, which last week announced the departure of John Thain and a plan to sell certain units. Thain's goal had been just the opposite - to turn CIT into a TBTF.
The biggest of the big won't be quaking in their boots, says Reilly, noting the typical tools of the activist - boosting capital returns or levering up - would be dead on arrival in Washington. As much as investors would like to see Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) broken up in order to realize value - they haven't traded above book value in seven years - it's not going to happen this way.

A badly-burned Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) won't do it anymore, but JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) - aiming to make up for slowing business in its mortgage operation - is increasingly buying loans from smaller lenders, writes Dan Freed for Reuters.In H1, the Bank of Dimon bought 62% of the $58B in residential mortgages added to its books, up from 56% in 2014 and 37% in 2011.

The Street has priced in earnings declines for pretty much every sector, but Q3 and Q4 estimates for the financials have barely budged, and consensus sees Q3 results 10% above that of a year ago.
Morgan Stanley's Huw van Steenis, however, sees FICC revenue declines of 10-25% - far more than the 5% or so that's been talked about by bank managements at recent investor conferences - as the commodity price crash combines with collapsing fixed-income trading, and the lack of volatility in forex action.
With just $20B in FICC revenues, says van Steenis, Q3 is shaping up to be the second worst quarter for banks in the last two years. Leaving his own bank (NYSE:MS) out of the analysis, he sees FICC revenue declines of 17% at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), 9% at Goldman (NYSE:GS), and 6% at BofA (NYSE:BAC) and Citi (NYSE:C).
Bottom line: "On EPS, we are 4% below consensus on average across our coverage for 2015, and 5% below for 2016. The biggest delta is for Barclays (NYSE:BCS), BNP Paribas (OTCQX:BNPQY), and Goldman in 2015, and SocGen (OTCPK:SCGLY), HSBC, and BNP in 2016."

With some questioning if Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) cost-cutting strategy under CEO Brian Moynihan is losing steam, the bank yesterday began laying off roughly 200 employees in its trading and investment-banking units.
In recent years, those units generated up to 40% of bank revenue with less than 10% of the company's staff, but BofA is the only major U.S. bank which posted a decline in trading and investment banking revenue in H1. It's also lost ground in areas targeted for growth like M&A.
"The rules have changed," says COO Thomas Montag, who is in charge of the units. The bank, he says, is no longer going to do business in some products and activities it previously engaged in.
The news is not all bad. Montag's push to get the investment bank to work with the wealth management and the consumer bank (he showed up at one bank function with a hat and t-shirt emblazoned with the words "Cross Sell") appears to be paying some dividends. Referral volume of 4.2M in 2014 gained from 300K in 2010, with a success rate of 20%.

Presentation slides
Notable is the $1.15T deposit base - its value will be more visible when rates rise, says Moynihan. The FOMC decision comes later today.
Taking questions, Moynihan says he expects FICC revenue to fall 5-6% in Q3, about the same as what Ciit's John Gerspach hinted at in his presentation yesterday.
The topic of the vote on whether Moynihan can keep both the CEO and chairman title did not come up.

Merger-and-acquisition volume in 2016-17 should be $3.3T-$4.5T, says Guggenheim, up from its previous forecast of $2.7T-$4.5T. The current drivers of M&A are likely to remain in place; macroeconomic conditions may remain uneven; and several specific factors may compel consolidation in certain industries. Health care, media, and telecom activity has been robust, and should stay so. Activity in energy should increase, but banking M&A should stay subdued.
The winners? U.S. bulge bracket and boutique firms have gained market share at the expense of European and other non-U.S. companies. Showing the most market share gains is Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), followed by Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C). Goldman remains Guggenheim's Best Idea, and BofA and Ciit remain buys, partly thanks to the M&A thesis.

A lot of investors and proxy firms are making headlines arguing for a vote against Bank of America (BAC +2%) CEO Brian Moynihan retaining the chairman's role, but the bank is mounting its own campaign in favor of the dual role.
BofA head of strategy and marketing, general counsel Gary Lynch, and lead independent director Jack Bovender have been meeting with big investors both by phone and in New York to make their case. The bank is also paying $150K plus expenses to two outside firms to make phone calls to individual investors.
The bank argues that taking the chairman role from Moynihan at this time - just as earnings are beginning to improve and the bank has seemingly overcome its stress test flubs - would be a distraction and throw BofA back into uncertainty. Those close to the matter say Moynihan hasn't given any indication of whether he would exit the CEO spot should he lose the chairman vote.

The country's two largest pension funds - the California Public Employees' Retirement System and the California State Teachers' Retirement System - will vote against a measure allowing CEO Brian Moynihan to retain the chairman spot at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
The two roles have "inherent conflicts" requiring them to remain separate and independent, say the funds in a letter to the bank's lead independent director Jack Bovender. The funds also note continuing underperformance of the stock price since Moynihan took the CEO role in 2010, struggles with the annual stress tests, and "sub-par engagement" with investors. “Given these missteps, we do not believe now is the time to reduce oversight of management by combining the roles of CEO and chair.”

Continuing his campaign against allowing Moynihan to serve in the two roles, Mike Mayo brings a megaphone onto CNBC. A "yes" vote on Sept. 22 - allowing Moynihan to retain both spots - could put a regulatory target on the industry's back (surely he means another regulatory target).

A rare growth business for Wall Street banks has been loans backed by investment portfolios, but with margin calls being issued this week, profits could take a hit if clients pull back from borrowing.
Morgan Stanley (MS +1.6%) had $25.3B in securities-based loans outstanding as of June 30, up 37% year-over-year. Bank of America (BAC +0.2%) had $38.6B of the loans, up 14.2%. Wells Fargo (WFC +1.1%) had $59.3B, up 16%.
The amounts are small compared to overall bank lending, but change comes at the margin, and the largest brokerage firms have reported higher securities-based loan balances each quarter for more than two years.

For offense, JPM "is a unique self-help story given tailwinds from expense savings" and has "historically gained market share in tougher environments."

With Q2 results for the nation's largest banks now all in, Dick Bove says the key takeaway is operating earnings - which eliminates taxes, and the impact from loan losses and reserve releases - are not just growing, they're jumping. By his calculation, the operating earnings for BAC, C, JPM, and WFC are up 23% for the last twelve months compared to the previous period.
Asset quality is far better nowadays as well, he says, noting the new regulatory regime has forced lenders to hold a higher amount of government-guaranteed paper on their books. "The addition of capital, cash, and government-backed securities means that the book value of these companies is very real. Yet, at least two of the big banks sell at a discount to this value."
More bullish points: The most onerous and costly of the new regulations are already out there, litigation - while continuing - won't be nearly as expensive going forward, M&A is on the rise, and trading activity is coming back.
Most importantly, says Bove, is that investment psychology is shifting. "The attitude that banks are utilities that can never show earnings gains is disappearing. The view that bank asset values are overstated is gone or should be gone. The view that the government has multiple new ways to attack these companies is also disappearing."

Consumers continue to shift  away from branches toward self-service, says Bank of America (BAC +2.7%) CFO Bruce Thompson. CEO Brian Moynihan says to expect more branch cuts over time, but warns about upsetting clients if closings are pushed too hard.
Full-time equivalent employees at BofA of 216,679 fell from 219,658 at the end of Q1 and 233,201 one year ago. Branch count of 4,789 fell from 4,835 at the end of Q1 and 5,023 one year ago. ATM count of 15,992 stands against 15,903 at the end of Q1 and 15,973 one year ago.
The "application of technology" is allowing the cutting of some workers, says Moynihan, while at the same time the bank is hiring "customer-facing" employees. "We continue to work expenses," he says.

Analysts are expecting Q2 EPS of $0.36 versus $0.19 one year ago - the big jump coming thanks to last year's Q being hit with litigation costs. Revenue, however, is expected to drop slightly (JPMorgan and Wells Fargo both missed on the top line earlier today).

Yield-starved financial sector names were mercilessly punished to start 2015 as sharply falling interest rates in January again disappointed investors waiting for the return of some spread income.
The rout in bond prices since, alongside what now seems the near-certainty of the beginning of Fed rate hikes in as soon as three months has helped turn things around, and the sector - as measured by the Financial Select SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLF) - is now in the green for the year, and trails the S&P 500 by just about 150 basis points.

Cost-cutting is still a catalyst for Bank of America (BAC +2.5%), says JPMorgan's Vivek Juneja, noting the lender could add another $0.06 to annual EPS and improve its efficiency ratio by 100 basis points by cutting LAS expenses another $250M (as it plans to do). The bank has also just begun its SIM program (Simplify and Improve) to find cost savings which will free up money for growth investments.
Goldman Sachs (GS +0.5%), says the team at Wells Fargo, is set to benefit from continued strength in M&A, plus potential to see greater client activity as rates rise. The bank's greater expense flexibility suggests it will maintain a healthy ROE advantage to peers. The consensus for peer ROE next year is 8.8% - for Goldman to maintain its edge, says Wells, it would need to generate a ROE of 15.4% vs. the 14.7% it posted in Q1 this year.

 Any talks between Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) and Time Warner Cable (NYSE:TWC) about a merger may be up in the air, but bankers won't be the bottleneck, as they're ready to talk about $25B or even more to make it happen. Following previous reports that Charter could go for $25B-$30B in debt, the cableco is talking with the same four bankers that committed $24B to Charter's early-2014 bid: Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS), Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). As one banker noted, "it should be quick to move to next steps, as the banks know the company pretty well," and said the package should end up as two-thirds bonds. Aside from any regulatory issues, leverage seems to be foremost on the mind of dealmakers (and investors). Liberty Broadband's (NASDAQ:LBRDA) Greg Maffei has gone public with the notion that Liberty could raise capital through rights offerings or tap $700M in cash to help with funding while maintaining its 25% stake in Charter.

More than seven years after the global financial collapse, regulators and investors are still working through a mile-high pile of lawsuits and other civil actions, and it seems like the fines keep on coming.
Since the crisis, banks and other institutions have paid more than $150B in fines, settlements and other penalties, according to a tally by FT. That compares with the roughly $700B in profits generated by U.S. banks between 2007 and 2014.
So where have all the payments gone? The biggest have landed in the Justice Department, which has collected some $50B. Other heavy collectors include the FHFA, Fannie Mae, HUD and the SEC.

Earlier today, Regions Financial (NYSE:RF) and Fifth Third (NASDAQ:FITB) became the latest in a line of lenders reporting slimming net interest margins. For Regions, the average yield on its loan portfolio fell to 3.45% from 4.03% a year ago. "You’re trying to book the prudent loans that you have the opportunity to, but with the level of competition in the market, it’s hard to move those rates up absent some kind of interest-rate increase," said Regions chief Grayson Hall on the earnings call.
On average, U.S. banks with more than $10B in assets showed a NIM of 2.97% in Q4, the lowest level in 25 years according to the FDIC ... And it got worse in Q1. Six of the nine big commercial banks reporting so far - including Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and PNC Financial - had Q1 margins lower than Q4.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Regions - two banks seen as particularly sensitive to interest rates - are unsurprisingly the worst performers in the KBW bank index (NYSEARCA:KBE) this year, off 13.9% and 9.3% respectively.
What to do? Regions, for one, is trying to emulate the Wall Street big boys by bulking up its wealth management and capital markets operations. And maybe there's some more fat to trim. “We’re going to turn up the heat on expenses…and we’ll see where we get to,” said PNC boss William Demchak on last week's conference call.

"Investors want to see more," says Morgan Stanley's Betsy Grasek, taking note of Bank of America's (BAC +1.5%) driving down of core expenses and legacy asset costs. The bank's compensation costs to revenue ratio, however, is the highest among both money center banks and the super-regionals (40% vs. median 34%). "We believe they have room to bring this down, especially in a low revenue environment."
She maintains an Overweight rating and $20 price target.
Oppenheimer also maintains its positive rating despite what it calls a "dreadful quarter" for BofA. The "one-time" charges of $1.5B for retirement-eligible incentive costs and market-related adjustements to NII may not be so "one-time," says the team, also noting that core expenses are not falling inline with revenue.

It's a low bar to cross for Bank of America (BAC -1.2%), say Citi analysts Keith Horowitz and Michael Cronin. Even though the Citi team's 2016 EPS estimate of $1.45 is well below the Street at $1.65, the stock trades at just a bit above tangible book value (reported at $14.79 as of March 31).
Combine that with BofA's being seen as a preferred vehicle to play Fed rate hikes given the bank's asset sensitivity, and it makes the stock a tactical buy.

Doing a sum of the parts analysis, Morgan Stanley slaps a regional bank multiple on Bank of America's (BAC +0.7%) consumer/other businesses and Goldman's multiple on BofA's investment bank/trading business, and finds the value comes to $15.70 - roughly the same as the current price.
This means the wealth management division - which Morgan values at $4.84 per share - comes for free. Morgan notes BofA has generated the strongest AUM growth among its large-cap bank peers over the past couple of years - 14% CAGR vs. peer median of 11%. The division has also generated revenue CAGR of 6% and pre-provision operating profit CAGR of 12%.
What's holding BAC back? Regulation and uncertainty over capital returns, of course, along with interest rates - investors continue to wait for higher ones and BofA is considered the most rate-sensitive of the big banks.

|Apr. 5, 2015, 8:29 AM|Brokerages get tough with advisers who break rules


Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) is shaking up the ranks of its 14,000 brokers with an apparent zero-tolerance approach to brokers who break key company rules.
Case in point: A top Indiana adviser with $1.3B in AUM was terminated in March without advanced warning. Merrill said it "lost confidence" in the adviser, ranked No.1 in his state on the closely-followed Barron’s Top Adviser rankings since 2010, for  “conduct including failing to discuss service level and pricing alternatives with a customer, providing inaccurate information to firm management during account reviews regarding this issue, mismarking bond cross-trade order tickets as unsolicited and providing information to a client during an active account review that did not correspond to the firm’s records.”
In the past, brokerages tended to giving second chances to top producers. The new, tougher approach is seen largely as a response to closer regulatory scrutiny of brokerages.
Securities lawyers agree this attitude is taking hold in the industry. Even small violations, such as poor record keeping or email retention, are drawing stricter penalties.

Looking for some kind of growth wherever they can find it, banks are about to get their wish as Fair Isaac is set to launch a new credit scoring metric which should expand by tens of millions the field of those eligible to get credit.
The new score will pull payment histories for things like utilities to calculate credit scores for consumers who might otherwise not have one. Other things - like how often someone changes address - will be used to help calculate a score.
FICO and 10 unnamed credit card issuers have been testing the new score since November, and Fair Isaac intends to roll things out nationwide by year-end. Right now, about 15M of the 53M previously unscorable Americans can be scored using the new system.

The big banks have had a rough start to the year, but surging trading volume in bonds, currencies, and commodities in Q1 could make for pleasant surprises when the lenders report quarterly results next month, writes John Carney.
The average daily trading volume across all U.S. bonds was up 10.6% Y/Y through the end of February, according to Sifma, with trading in corporate bonds up 18.1%, driven by a big rise in issuance. Trading in Fannie, Freddie, and Ginnie MBS was up 35.3% from a year ago.

Bank of America (BAC -1%) - though given just conditional approval - is set for $4B in buybacks and a nickel dividend. That's a total return of $6.1B vs. Trone's $3.1B estimate. Trone notes the bank can proceed with its buyback prior to resubmitting plans.
JPMorgan's (JPM +1%) $6.4B buyback was shy of Trone's $7B estimate, but the 10% dividend increase was better than forecast. The total capital return of $12.9B vs. his $13.2B forecast is a "marginal negative."
The dividend hike to $0.65 at Goldman (GS +2.1%) beat Trone's expectation of $0.62. As for the buyback, Goldman's policy of not disclosing the amount remains in place.

Investors are buying back some of the Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) they sold last week amid some nervousness about the lender not passing the Fed's stress test.
Previously: Selloff in BofA continues; down another 2% at the open (Feb. 27)
The bank showed a 7.1% CET1 ratio under the severe adverse scenario vs. the 5% minimum required. Whether this is enough to ensure a sizable increase in capital returns is another story, and one might bet the bank did not get terribly aggressive with its dividend and buyback requests.

Not this stuff again, one imagines Bank of America (BAC -0.9%) shareholders saying.
According to the WSJ, BofA's U.S. banking subsidiary for years has helped finance transactions from the bank's European investment bank arm which, among other things, helped hedge funds avoid taxes on stock dividends. According to the Journal, BofA has made about $1B in revenue from "dividend arbitrage" since the financial crisis.

A jury two  years ago found the bank liable to the tune of $1.27B.
No check will be written yet, as the denial clears the way for BofA to file another motion in appeals court, potentially setting up another long battle with the DOJ.

Consumer & business banking, wealth management, and global banking are all performing well and are why investors will be patient on BAC as a U.S. economy/higher interest rate play.
"Our gut is investors will be bummed about the revenue decline but stick with the stock as story hasn’t changed and valuation is a lot more palatable post the recent drop.”

2015 has opened much like 2014, with interest rates doing the exact opposite of what most expected, and falling sharply. It's a tough start for bank investors who have been counting on higher interest rates to help boost earnings for a number of years.
In the meantime, deposits keep rolling in, and the pace of lending growth isn't quick enough to absorb all the money. In 2014, loan balances rose 4.4%, but securities holdings popped 12%, and cash assets jumped 22%.
The good part of falling yields are unrealized gains on those security portfolios - negative a year ago, they're were in the green by about $15B on Dec. 31. More good news, says Goldman's Richard Ramsden: Valuations. The big banks are priced at about 9.9x estimated 2016 earnings, allowing for some nice upside if and when rates do decide to go higher.

Right now, we're just talking about a slowdown in lending, but Charles Peabody - who saw the losses incurred by Texas banks during the 1980s energy slump - expects the current situation to lead to losses as well.

The flip side of energy issues might be stronger business for banks elsewhere as consumers find themselves with more money in their pockets after filling up.

Jefferies yesterday posted a 73% plunge in fixed-income trading revenue for the quarter ended Nov. 30, and a 45% fall in equity-trading revenue. “You’re going to see weaker trading results because of what I’d call bad volatility,” says Charles Peabody, as firms cut back on stock and bond offerings.
That Q4 trading revenue is going to be a weak one for the likes of JPM, C, BAC, GS, and MS shouldn't be a major surprise as Ciit's Mike Corbat, BofA's Brian Moynihan, and JPM's Marianne Lake said as much when presenting at a financial services conference earlier this month. But the weakness they described is nowhere near what was reported at Jefferies.
Alongside the weak trading results, Jefferies is also looking to get rid of Bache - its commodities-trading business.

“Ultimately my balances aren’t as profitable for the banks, and that’s going to impact my business,” says an executive with a title insurance company, complaining of sleepless nights amid negotiations with his bankers.
BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) has begun charging institutional clients money to park money in euros, and State Street (NYSE:STT) says itwill soon begin doing so.
Some bankers are advising large clients to break up large deposits across a number of lenders (including smaller banks not subject to the new regulations), and other corporations are going to find themselves needing to build more sophisticated (and riskier) portfolios likely including vehicles like short-term bond funds and uninsured money-market funds.

|Nov. 29, 2014, 8:00 AM|Easier mortgage standards on the way


New guidelines - set to take full effect on December 1 - are the result of an agreement reached last month between banks and the GSEs meant to clarify exactly when lenders could be called to task for mortgages sold to Fannie Mae (OTCQB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac (OTCQB:FMCC) which ultimately default. Since the financial crisis, Fannie and Freddie have forced banks to repurchase billions of dollars worth of mortgages, leaving them naturally gun-shy about making new loans to all but the most pristine of credits.
“It’s providing greater certainty for all the parties so that you can lend more confidently and make the whole judgment process much easier and more clear cut,” says Mike Heid, president of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) Home Mortgage. Along with SunTrust (NYSE:STI), Wells says borrowers should begin to see initial changes - such as faster processing times, reduced credit score requirements, and greater leeway to those whose credit history suffered due to one-time events - in a few weeks.
"We will be able to be looser and open up the net wider," says Mason-McDuffie Mortgage CEO Bill Godfrey, now expecting to make loans down to a 620 credit score from 660 previously.
Not everyone agrees: “Unless we are convinced that the rules are going to be permanent and there is not going to be a look back or a reach back in future times…we are simply going to stay on the sidelines," U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) boss Richard Davis has said, and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan made similar comments at a recent conference.

The two cases both come from Florida and involve so-called "stripping off," where a homeowner in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing can void second mortgage debt when the first mortgage is greater than a home's value.

Real sweethearts if you believe the reports, the likes of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) are being investigated by the Feds for still going after borrowers after their debt has been legally discharged in a bankruptcy.Paying little attention to such court-ordered discharges, the banks reportedly are keeping the debt alive on credit reports, more or less attempting to force borrowers to pay on bills which they no longer owe.The issue, say sources, is the way banks report to credit agencies. Once a debt is voided through bankruptcy, creditors must update credit reports showing that debt is cleared. Banks, however, routinely fail to do so, instead leaving notations of "past due" or "charged off." A clerical mistake would be one thing, but, according to a number of bankruptcy judges,, banks refuse to make corrections unless the borrower pays.The banks contend they are complying with all federal laws in their collection and sale of debt. Class-action suits have also been filed and the banks are trying to have them thrown out, arguing its third-party debt buyers who are in control.|Nov. 12, 2014, 1:02 PM|Moynihan: BofA not about to lower mortgage standards

"I don't think there's a big incentive for us to start to try to create more mortgage availability where the customers are susceptible to default," he says, and those who can't come up with at least a 10% down payment should probably consider remaining as renters. "You won't see us start to expand our criteria much past what we've done today."

|Oct. 27, 2014, 12:03 PM|BofA's mortgage settlement hung up on SEC infighting


The $16.7B settlement supposedly agreed to in August is being held up by two Democratic SEC commissioners over waiving additional sanctions set to kick in when the deal is entered in court. The two Republican commissioners are fine with the waivers, and the swing vote - SEC Chair Mary Jo White - isn't participating due to a conflict.
At issue is political pressure that lawmakers have been too soft on Wall Street. Banks typically seek - and are granted - three key waivers when settling cases, with the most important one being a ban on managing mutual funds. For Bank of America (BAC -1.1%), the key waiver would allow it to continue seeking investors for private firms like tech companies which haven't yet gone public.
The waivers are often one of the reasons financial firms decide to settle cases rather than go to trial. “The commission and its staff should not be in the business of rubber-stamping and approving all waiver applications simply because a request is made,” says Commissioner Luis Aguilar, one of the two who are holding the settlement up.

Global growth, foreign-exchange, oil, and small caps are the subject of every client inquiry, says David Kostin. His team's recommendation: Buy "American exceptionalism."
In Kostin's view, U.S. economy and corporate fundamentals are still strong, with economic growth expected by Goldman economists to be 3.2% next year, the fastest expansion since 2005. Europe is expected to grow just 1%.
What his team likes are those stocks of companies which have a high proportion of domestic sales, plus sectors like Consumer Staples (XLP -0.1%) and Discretionary (XLY +0.7%) which stand to benefit from lower oil prices (plunging again today).
As for small caps (IWM +0.9%), Kostin is wary, noting downward earnings revisions have boosted small cap P/E ratios even as prices have declined.

The usual banking suspects are falling under the gaze of regulators for a trading strategy known as "dividend arbitrage" which helps their hedge fund clients reduce taxes, and from which the banks earn more than $1B in fees annually.
The strategy - typically run from London - involves banks temporarily transferring ownership of stock to a lower-tax jurisdiction about the time when the client expects to receive a dividend on those shares. It's perfectly legal say the banks and hedge funds.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), however, has been questioned by the Richmond Fed (Charlotte comes under its purview) about the legal and reputational risks of such maneuvers, reports the WSJ.
It isn't clear if other banks have been similarly questioned, but a number of other lenders do the same thing. Among the hedge funds which benefit from dividend arbitrage is Och-Ziff Capital Management (NYSE:OZM).

"Starting next year," writes Jack Hough in Barron's, "BofA (NYSE:BAC) investors will get a glimpse of two things they haven't seen in years: a fairly clean income statement and a decent dividend." Litigation costs are set to nail the bank again this quarter, but then will begin to quickly clear away, leaving investors to focus on the bank's operations. Earnings per share - an estimated $0.75 this year - could hit $2 in 2017, and the annual dividend ($0.20 now) could rise to $0.55.
CEO Brian Moynihan notes core pretax profit in four of BofA's five units was $8.5B in Q2, up from $6.8B two years ago. Business #5 is mortgages, and that provided a $4.5B loss thanks to now rapidly fading legacy issues. Litigation costs make most of the headlines, but there's also non-litigation expenses like modifying some loans and foreclosing on others. These costs dropped to $1.4B last quarter from $2.3B a year earlier, and are expected to fall to $500M in 2015.
Upgrading BofA to a Buy earlier this month, Goldman - looking past litigation and other one-time items - says the bank has had the largest reduction in earnings volatility of any of its peers in recent years and the stablest trading revenues since 2013. The beacon is Wells Fargo - earnings stability and a higher dividend has that stock trading at a premium 1.7x book value. BofA is at 0.8x, and as its steadier earnings begin to become clearer, that valuation discount should narrow.
Bank of America is also underowned, says Goldman, noting its weighting in mutual funds relative to its weighting in the S&P 500 is the second lowest among 25 large financials (the lowest is Berkshire Hathaway).

Isn't this one of the ways we got into the housing mess? Citigroup (NYSE:C) signs on with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) to fund 15-year mortgages at below-market rates for borrowers with low incomes, spotty credit histories, or both.
The loans are being originated by the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America (NACA), a group - that has the ear of HUD - known for pushing banks to show they're fulfilling the terms required of them by the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (no redlining).
The moves also follow the banks' massive mortgage settlements, part of which were agreements to provide assistance to troubled mortgagees, though both say this new program is not related.
For its part, NACA says the foreclosure-loss rate on more than 18K purchase loans it has originated since 2006 is about 0%, with one of the reasons being NACA making up to three months of mortgage payments when borrowers run into trouble.

Cost savings of $2B from the New BAC initiative were originally expected by mid-2015, but with $1.8B already booked by Q2, Bank of America (BAC +0.5%) expects to hit $2B by the end of this year, says CFO Bruce Thompson. The other savings initiative - Legacy Assets and Servicing costs are expected to fall to $1.1B by 2015 Q1. They were $1.4B in Q2 of this year.

Turning to capital, the bank's fully phased-in Basel 3 common equity tier 1 ratio of 9.9% compares to the proposed minimum of 8.5% by 2019.
As for net interest income, it's holding steady - $10.4B in Q2 vs. $10.5B two years ago - but, like everyone else in financial services, the bank awaits higher interest rates for growth in this segment.
Credit quality trends continue to improve, and the bank is highly provisioned: Its allowance for loans and losses - $15.8B in Q2 vs. $21.2B two years ago - is 3.67x the annualized charge-off rate vs. 2.51x two years ago.

The Fed intends to impose a capital surcharge on banks tougher than the international standard, according to Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo's prepared remarks for the Senate Banking Committee. Those banks with heavier reliance on short-term funding like overnight loans - i.e. Goldman Sachs (GS -1%) and Morgan Stanley (MS -1.8%) - will likely face even more rigorous requirements.
Officials haven't yet decided on a number, but reportedly are considering as much as 200 basis points more than the top range of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets agreed to by international regulators.
What's not yet clear is who would need to raise capital to meet the new, tougher standard.

"Most of the reason that banks are underearning relative to their historical norms ... is economic and not regulatory," says Richard Pzena (NYSE:PZN), who remains bullish on the TBTFs. Low interest rates, weak trading, and "government persecution" are the three factors, and - should these normalize - earnings could nearly double at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C), though JPMorgan's (NYSE:JPM) boost would be more modest. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is another favorite.

Another cheap sector is energy, says Pzena, and based on relative valuation against the broader market - whether price-to-book or price-to-earnings - the major integrated oil companies are selling near all-time lows.
What the market is missing, says Pzena, is the nature of oil investment. The old days saw capital spending one year, and boosted volume the next.

Wall Street firms led by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are closing in on a deal to purchase a stake in chat and instant messaging start-up Perzo as an alternative to Bloomberg's similar application, Reuters reports.
Bloomberg has dominated Wall Street for years, but banks have been looking for a substitute as sluggish trading volumes and higher regulations weigh on revenues. Bloomberg's trading and news terminal costs about $20,000 a year, while Perzo's applications are open-source and free. Bloomberg customers must also buy an entire terminal, and cannot just buy the messaging system and adapt it.

The big banks aren't quite ready to let go of their reserve releases: The big four - JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) - released a combined $2.25B of their bad-loan reserves in Q2, up nearly 20% from the $1.88B they released in Q1.
The banks continue to see improvement in their customers’ credit quality, but their earnings continue to rely in part on freeing up some of their rainy-day cushions, rather than being able to generate strong earnings from their operating businesses.
Even with the Q2 uptick, the banks are releasing less in the way of reserves than they have for most of the past four years, and analysts see the practice ending before too much longer.
Some regional banks such as Comerica (NYSE:CMA) and Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN) that had been releasing reserves started building their reserves up again by small amounts during Q2.

The bank last March originally received Fed permission to boost its quarterly payout from $0.01 to $0.05 (along with a $4B buyback), but was forced to withdraw that plan after discovering it miscalculated capital levels.
Bank of America (BAC) subsequently fixed the accounting issue and resubmitted a capital plan in May, and the WSJ reports the lender is requesting the same size dividend, though the buyback plan has been toned down.
For the bank - which has made boosting the dividend a top priority - the move projects to the Fed a sign of strength and that there are no more accounting cockroaches out there. For the Fed, its decision will establish a precedent for how these errors might be dealt with in the future.
All this is happening as pressure mounts for BofA to come to a settlement with the DOJ over mortgages, and word is Eric Holder has no interest in talking turkey with Brian Moynihan until their lieutenants get a lot closer to a final deal.

Eric Holder says he will not meet with BofA (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan to discuss a settlement over the bank's mortgage lawsuit with the Justice Department, Reuters reports. The Attorney General states that the "parties remain too far apart for a meeting to be productive."
In prior negotiations over the shoddy mortgage selling lawsuit, BofA discussed paying $12B to resolve the claims, although the Justice Department countered with a $17B settlement .
JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon previously cut a $13B deal with Holder regarding his bank's involvement with its mortgage selling before the financial crisis, and BofA was seeking a similar negotiation.

The bank issued $91B in private-label MBS between 2005 and 2008, say Morgan Stanley's Betsy Graseck and Manan Gosalia. That's just 20% of what JPMorgan sold and 14% of Bank of America's issuance.
The reported $7B settlement would amount to 7.7% of Citigroup's (C -0.3%) pre-crisis issuance vs. JPMorgan's 2% settlement - this despite the fact that losses on Citi's MBS book were inline with its peer group. Nevertheless, the team notes these press rumors have been somewhat on the mark and cut their Q2 EPS estimate by $0.70 to $0.40 to account for the $4B hard-dollar amount (the other $3B is for borrower relief).
Up next is Bank of America (BAC -0.2%), which will now see boosted pressure to reach a deal with the DOJ, and Morgan has baked in a $12B settlement, or 1.8% of the face amount of securities issued. Other press reports have suggested a number closer to $17B.

Combine that with valuation - BofA sells for 8.8x 2015 EPS vs. Goldman at 9.7x, JPMorgan at 9.1x, and Citi at 9x - and expense reductions which should be better than peers, and Bank of America could be the buy of the group.

Banks could lose up to $4.5B in annual revenue as new regulations alter how swaps are traded, according to a report from McKinsey & Co. That amount is equal to 35% of the $13B in revenue booked by banks from trading in rate derivatives, and it comes at a time when FICC business is already on the decline.
At issue are new rules requiring swaps trade on electronic systems rather than over the phone ("Thanks, big boy"), and the greater transparency should bite into profits. To counter this, says McKinsey's Roger Rudisuli, banks will have to cut costs and realign teams to focus attention on fewer customers.
The usual suspects make up the 5 largest U.S. swaps dealers: JPM, C, BAC, GS, and MS.

Among the benefits of the program are lower rates on mortgages and home equity loans, higher rates on savings accounts, and free stock trades.

|May 9, 2014, 3:26 PM|Mortgages: Go big


“Jumbos are growing while almost everything else is dead,” says FBR's Paul Miller. “Big banks need loan growth. If they were getting decent commercial loan growth, they wouldn’t be so aggressive on competing for jumbos.”
As the rest of the home loan market contracts (sharply), applications for jumbo mortgages (above $729K) were up 4.9% Y/Y in March. Another reason for banks plowing into jumbos: They don't have to pay the higher guarantee fees charged by the GSEs, allowing them to actually charge lower rates than on conforming loans. At Wells Fargo (WFC), the current rate for a 30-year fixed jumbo mortgage of 4.13% is 12 basis points less than that for a conventional mortgage loan.
JPMorgan (JPM) is boosting its efforts and created a special process to review all declined loans to make sure the decisions make sense. It also has a group working with wealthier clients who have more complex financial situations, such as being self-employed. The bank's jumbo mortgage originations accounted for 21% of all mortgages in Q1, up from 10% a year earlier.
At Bank of America (BAC -1.7%) the down payment required for most jumbos less than $1M was cut this year to 15% from 20%, and nonconforming originations in Q1 were 37% of all mortgages vs. 22% last year.

A check of the global banks finds the group pacing market declines in morning action after Friday night's warning on Q2 trading revenue from JPMorgan (JPM -2.2%).
Nomura's Steven Chubak is first out with lower JPMorgan earnings estimates.
Jim Cramer sums up sentiment: "This has been a house of pain. You can't own these right now. You just can't."
Morgan Stanley (MS -1.9%), Goldman Sachs (GS -1.5%), Citigroup (C -1.2%), and Bank of America (BAC -1%), Deutsche Bank (DB -1.2%). Far less trading dependent than the other Too Big Too Fails is Wells Fargo (WFC -0.2%).

He didn't want to "go to war" with management, says Warren Buffett, responding to the first question asked of him at the Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) annual meeting: Why did he abstain from voting on the controversial equity compensation plan for Coca-Cola (KO) executives?
"You keep belching at the dinner table, you'll be eating in the kitchen," says Buffett, describing the clubby culture of corporate boards where being agreeable keeps you on the inside and being confrontational gets you blackballed. "I've voted for compensation plans in various places that are far from what I would have designed myself ... That is the way boards work."
A shareholder proposal requesting Berkshire board consideration of a dividend received less than 2% of the vote, pleasing to Buffett who believes he and Charlie Munger can do a better job of allocating company capital than returning it to shareholders. Still, with $40B and rising in Berkshire's coffers, even Buffett concedes the day is coming when the company has "more cash than we can intelligently invest."
"That error that they made doesn't bother me," says Buffett of Bank of America (BAC), which had to suspend its capital return plan after miscalculating capital levels. "It doesn't change my feeling about Bank of America's risk management one iota."
Mungerisms: Comparing Berkshire book value to the S&P 500 is "insane" and makes it harder for Buffett to look good. "Warren sets a ridiculously high standard. The last couple of years added $60B in value ... If that's failure, then I want more of it."
|May 3, 2014, 8:21 AM|Cyclical or secular? JPMorgan warns again on trading business


With Q1 results for the global banks just in the books, JPMorgan (JPM) becomes the first to warn on trading revenues in Q2, expecting markets revenue to slip 20% after declining 17% in Q1.
SEC Form 10-Q
As in the past, the biggest driver of the slide is weakness in fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) as investors continue to shy from exotic fixed-income vehicles contrived by bankers, and instead favor less profitable (for the bond desks) government and high-grade corporate bonds. There's also new regulations which have forced banks away from lucrative businesses like energy trading.
"I don't look at the $5 billion in markets revenue and cry in my soup," said CEO Jamie Dimon on Q1's earnings call (the bank did $5.37B in trading business in Q1), stressing his belief that the current tough time for trading is cyclical not secular.
JPMorgan fell 1.5% in after hours trading following the news last night. Morgan Stanley (MS) -0.5%, Goldman Sachs (GS) -0.1%, Bank of America (BAC) -0.7%, Citigroup (C) -0.4%: "Certainly J.P. Morgan's forecast does not bode well for the other big banks," says RBC's Gerard Cassidy.
|May 2, 2014, 3:42 AM|Fed special unit to give extra scrutiny to 15 firms

 Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) are on a Fed list of 15 U.S. and foreign financial firms that "may pose elevated risks to U.S. financial stability" and so will receive extra supervision by a cross-disciplinary special unit called the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee. Other firms on the list include  JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), AIG (AIG), GE (GE), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), State Street (STT), Prudential Financial (PRU), Barclays (BCS), Credit Suisse (CS), Deutsche Bank (DB) and UBS (UBS). As a major clearing and custody bank, Bank of New York Mellon (BK), will also receive the extra attention. |Apr. 29, 2014, 11:09 AM|BofA blunder likely means no buyback this year


Yesterday's selloff in Bank of America (BAC +1.1%) was likely overdone in light of the bank's capital levels, says Morgan Stanley's Betsy Graseck, suggesting the end result will be BofA scrapping a buyback this year, but reinstating the dividend boost (to $0.05 per share quarterly from $0.01). CLSA's Mike Mayo, on the other hand, says the mistake raises doubt about controls, and reiterates his Sell rating.
Goldman's Richard Ramsden says the bank likely would have failed this year's CCAR (or come very close) based on the new leverage ratios, and notes the lost capital is about equal to the amount of the buyback. At this point, even if BofA passed the CCAR quantitatively, it could fail qualitatively thanks to its accounting processes. Toss in the pending massive litigation settlement with the DOJ (which has come to light post-CCAR).
This will be the first time the Fed has required a bank suspend its capital plan and require a resubmission mid-year, says Ramsden. "In our view this could signal a new level of oversight for banks that wish to continue returning capital when there has been a material change to their risk profile."

"We anticipate Bank of America (BAC -4.6%) will underperform its peers today," is the high-priced conclusion of the team at Wells Fargo after BofA is forced to suspend its capital return plans in the wake of an accounting miscalculation.
The actual net effect on the bank's capital will not be too material, says Wells, but reputational damage, upward pressure on expenses, and the idea of a more conservative capital return request next year could weigh on the stock over the next few months (for an example, see BB&T after the 2013 CCAR).
Wells currently has a Market Perform rating on the stock.

|Apr. 28, 2014, 8:48 AM|Black eye: BofA suspends buyback, dividend hike


At issue is a downward revision to the bank's capital ratios due to an incorrect treatment of certain structured notes assumed in 2009's Merrill Lynch acquisition.
The new estimated tier 1 capital ratio of 11.9% is 21 basis points lower than previously thought.
Bank of America (BAC) has notified the Fed, and has suspended its capital plan which included a $4B buyback this year as well as a boost in the dividend to a nickel per share from a penny. After third-party review, the bank expects to resubmit its capital plan to the Fed ASAP.

Former Bank of America (BAC -1.7%) CFO Joe Price will pay a fine of $7.5M and be prohibited from serving as an officer or director of a public company for 18 months to settle charges lobbed by the New York AG that he - along with other BofA execs - failed to disclose more than $9B of projected losses at Merrill Lynch prior to a shareholder vote on the acquisition. Former bank CEO Ken Lewis last month agreed to pay $10M to settle.
NY AG Schneidermann's office says it has evidence the bank withheld information from the federal government as well even as it sought financial aid.

Bank of America (BAC) is 1.1% lower in premarket action after last night's leak of the DOJ seeking more than another $13B out of the hide of shareholders over legacy mortgage issues, according to Bloomberg. The settlement would come on top of the $9.5B agreed to by the bank to resolve FHFA claims, and a deal could come within the next two months, according to sources.
Most of the loans in question became BofA's problem after it purchased Countrywide and Merrill Lynch - one made the punk loans and the other packaged them into MBS.
This deal - which would also resolve state AG charges - would tower over JPMorgan's eye-popper of a $13B settlement from last year, which included $4B for the FHFA.
They're coming for your banks next: There are another eight lenders under investigation by the DOJ and state attorneys general over similar charges.

BNY Mellon (BK +2.1%) has hired Goldman Sachs to find a buyer for the unit, reports Bloomberg, and is expected to begin receiving offers in about a month. The corporate trust arm assists companies with making payments on debt they issue as well as helping customers recover funds in event of default.The business services about $12T in outstanding debt, with 3.5K employees at 61 global offices, but has become less lucrative since the financial crisis made the packaging and selling of loans a more difficult business. Possible buyers could be large commercial banks looking to build out their own trust business such as Bank of America (BAC), U.S. Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo (WFC), or PNC Financial, says Guggenheim's Marty Mosby.On a recent earnings call, BNY management said run-off in the unit would cut annual revenue by $50M-$75M annually, roughly 0.5% of total bank revenue.|Apr. 21, 2014, 2:59 PM|Merrill raises the bar for top broker recognition


Merrill Lynch's (BAC -0.5%) top recognition club previously was its "Circle of Champions" for wealth managers who produced $4M of commissions, but now - in a sign the company expects new programs and technologies to unleash new sales power - the "Pinnacle Club" will pay brokers $10K in cash and additional benefits if they break $8M in revenue.
Reporting results last week, Merrill said its Thundering Herd was on target to produce $1.06M each this year, one of the top figures in the industry. That average, however, is skewed by the top rainmakers - some of whom will qualify for the club.
Spokespeople at Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and UBS - whose recognition clubs top out at $2M-$3M in annual revenue - did not immediately respond to questions on their plans for those levels.

Bank of America (BAC -2.5%) boosted legal reserves by $2.4B in Q1, and management is playing coy about why, but the WSJ says the bank is near a multi-billion dollar settlement with the DOJ to end civil probes into a number of legacy issues. The talks have been ongoing for months, but intensified, say sources, after JPMorgan late last year settled for $13B.|Apr. 16, 2014, 11:46 AM|BofA results have something for bulls and bears, says Goldman


The bears, though, are winning the day, with analyst Richard Ramsden saying the stock could see pressure - a result of questions about a path to reaching 2015 and 2016 EPS estimates of $1.60 and $1.85 combining with recent outperformance (stock's beating the BKX by 500 bps YTD).
The bulls, he says, can point to the best FICC results seen so far from the banks, rapidly declining LAS expenses, stable NIM, and strong capital and liquidity ratios.
He maintains a Neutral rating and $18 price target on Bank of America (BAC -2.4%).

|Apr. 16, 2014, 9:23 AM|BofA talks mobile, cost cuts, legal reserves on earnings call


"People effectively carry a branch in their pocket," says Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan on the earnings call (live now on Seeking Alpha), noting mobile banking customers grew 19% Y/Y to 15M and 10% of deposits now take place on mobile devices. Consumer banking costs fell 4% from last year, he notes. CFO Bruce Thompson: “We continue to reduce production staffing levels in the quarter consistent with the volumes.”
Inquiring minds want to know more about the $2.4B boost to litigation reserves, and management is fairly tight-lipped, saying they're about addressing previously disclosed mortgage-related issues. Ambac (AMBC) shareholders looking for movement in their case against BofA may be disappointed as Thompson says the reserve increase isn't about a pending settlement with the monolines.

Net interest income of $10.3B fell 5% Y/Y, with NIM of 2.36% up six basis points. Noninterest income of $12.5B is flat from last year, with lower mortgage banking income and trading profits offset by increases in investment and brokerage income, equity investment income and gains on the sale of debt securities.
Provision for credit losses of $1B is down 41%. Net charge-offs of $1.4B down 45%, with net charge-off ratio of 0.62% comparing to 1.14% a year ago. Reserve release of $379M vs. $804M a year ago.
Noninterest expense of $22.2B is up from $19.5B a year ago, with higher mortgage litigation costs ($6B vs. $2.2B) partly offset by cuts in Legacy Assets and Servicing (LAS). Excluding litigation, expenses fell $1.2B Y/Y.
Other highlights: Mobile banking customers up 19% to 15M - more than 10% of deposits now done through mobile; first mortgage originations fell 65% Y/Y, with production revenue of $273M comparing to $815M a year ago; Wealth Management net income of $729M vs. $721M a year ago.
Basel III Common equity ratio of 11.8% up from 11.7% at 2013's end. Tangible book value per share of $13.81 up $0.02 from year's end and from $13.36 one year ago.

Finalizing the criteria on the eight largest banks' leverage ratios - a minimum 5% at the holding company level and 6% at the bank subsidiary level - U.S. regulators impose a far tougher standard than international norms of 3%.
The eight affected: BK, BAC, C, GS, JPM, MS, STT, WFC.
The regulators at work were the Fed, the FDIC, and the OCC, and the Fed's Dan Tarullo indicates he wants to go further, signaling the central bank may boost the risk-based capital surcharge to a higher level than the international standard. The most to lose in this scenario would be investment banks like Goldman and Morgan Stanley who don't have the deposit bases of their retail brethren.
Banks have until January 1, 2018 to comply with the new rule.

Growth over the last several quarters has been between 15-20%, says the team, but a major slowdown to a decline of 3-5% in now expected in Q1 (results begin coming in this week). The reasons are the usual suspects: Weak mortgage banking, weak capital markets, and legal and regulatory issues that are going nowhere.
Among the banks whose estimates are cut is Bank of America (BAC), now seen earning just $0.02 per share in Q1 from $0.30 previously. For all 2014, EPS should be $0.98, down from $1.06 originally forecast.
Other cuts of note: JPMorgan (JPM) now expected to earn $1.30 in Q1 from $1.36. U.S. Bancorp (USB) at $0.72 vs. $0.75. First Horizon (FHN) $0.13 vs. $0.16, and CVB Financial (CVBF) $0.23 vs. $0.24.

The move would force banks to add tens of billions of dollars in loss-absorbing capital, although many firms have already been bulking up in anticipation of the rule change. Meanwhile, the Fed has given banks two extra years - until July 2017 - to ensure that their collateralized loan obligations (CLO) comply with the Volcker rule's restrictions on speculative investments.

Absent reforms, another financial crisis is likely to leave taxpayers on the hook for hundreds of billions, warns the IMF, estimating the world's biggest banks receive up to $590B in implicit public subsidies because of their TBTF status.
Said subsidies include bankers who still have a "heads I win, tails you lose" attitude, and investors who lend at lower cost to banks than they might otherwise. The IMF calculated the size of the subsidies by comparing the CDS prices and credit ratings across larger and smaller banks. While the amount has fallen since the crisis, it still remains sizable. "All in all ... the expected probability that systemically important banks will be bailed out remains high in all regions."
Subsidies for the biggest players are "like insurance for which banks don't need to pay a premium," says senior IMF analyst Gaston Gelos.

Count Credit Suisse's Moshe Orenbuch as surprised about the Fed's denial of Citigroup's (C -0.5%) capital return plan. Maybe Citi is just too tough for regulators to get their arms around as it is the most complicated of all the bank holding companies.
Included in the Credit Suisse report is this handy chart of dividends, buybacks, and payout ratios for all of the CCAR banks for 2013 and 2014. Things are loosening up - the median payout ratio (includes dividends and buybacks) this year of 71% compares to 59% in 2013. The dividend payout ratio rises to 26% from 23%.
It helps to be smaller - among the TBTFs, Citi's payout ratio is just 8%, BofA (BAC) 37%, JPMorgan (JPM) 56%, Morgan Stanley (MS) 41%. Wells Fargo is above the median though, being allowed a payout of 79%.
The regionals (KRE), trust banks, and credit card companies - for the most part - were all allowed payout ratios above the median.
The strongest capital returns vs. CS's expectations are those for BNY Mellon (BK), Capital One (COF), KeyCorp (KEY), Huntington Bancshares (HBAN), PNC Financial, and Wells Fargo.

Filed last summer, the lawsuit alleges Bank of America (BAC) made misstatements about mortgages sown up in $850M of MBS in 2008, but Judge David Cayer recommends it be tossed for two technical reasons, notably that the government doesn't demonstrate the alleged misstatements were material to the GSE's decision to buy the paper.

If upheld, the opinion would undercut the Obama administration's broader attempt to go after the nation's largest banks for their activities prior to the financial crisis.
|Mar. 27, 2014, 8:36 AM|Investors ratchet down bank capital return outlook


It's a slow grind for bank capital returns (at least those subject to the CCAR), notes Goldman' Richard Ramsden, with payout ratios boosted just four percentage points to 62% this year. There are clear winners, he says: The credit card companies led by AXP and COF and the trust banks led by BK. Regional banks (KRE) boosted returns but generally fell short of expectations (with HBAN and PNC being the exceptions). Worst-performing were the TBTFs, though JPM and WFC were positives.
"CCAR highlighted the challenges large-caps have in returning excess capital," he says, with Citigroup's (C) failure a reminder the process is unpredictable. With all that excess capital remaining on the balance sheet, Ciit's 2015 goal of a 10% ROTCE appears unlikely to be met.
For Bank of America (BAC), it's resubmission - a better outcome than outright failure - reminds that even well-capitalized banks are "bound by stressed capital and could have trouble returning outsized capital."

 The Federal Reserve is due to say today whether it approves banks' plans to pay dividends and/or repurchase stock. The process is spread out over a week so that banks can alter their programs if they don't receive Fed authorization. Last year, the Fed told JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) to change their capital-allocation plans. The Fed's decision will come a week after it said that 29 out of 30 banks had passed its stress tests. Relevant tickers include C, MS, BAC, BK, AXP, COF, C, FITB, PNC, RF, STT, STI, USB, WFC, ZION.

Capital return estimates for Bank of America (BAC -0.3%) look a "tad" too high, says Citi's Keith Horowitz, following BofA's getting just a passing grade from the Fed's stress test - its Tier 1 common equity ratio of 5.9% (corrected from the original 6%) under the Fed's adverse economic scenario was the lowest among the 29 of 30 banks which passed.
Horowitz previously estimated BofA would go for a $5B buyback and a $0.03 boost to its dividend (currently just $0.01), but he's thinking a slightly dialed-back repurchase plan may be in order.
Investors will find out after the bell on Wednesday just how close the bank has decided to cut it. Nevertheless, Horowitz would buy any dip should the capital return announcement prove disappointing.
|Mar. 24, 2014, 2:54 PM|BofA downgraded amid capital return worries; USB and Wells upgraded


Noting Bank of America's (BAC -0.9%) capital ratio in the Fed stress test was the lowest of any bank which passed, Atlantic Equities pulls its Overweight rating on the stock, and cuts the price target to $18.50 from $20. The stress test, says analyst Richard Staite, shows BofA with a $13B buffer over the minimum requirement, meaning maybe just $5B in buybacks and $2.5B dividends this year, "although we are somewhat nervous that it or another bank could be failed on a qualitative basis."
Still, Staite expects a boost in the quarterly payout to $0.06 per share from a penny.
Staite and team upgrade U.S. Bancorp (USB +0.7%) and Wells Fargo (WFC -0.4%) to Neutral from Underweight, citing the large margins by which they passed the stress test.
In other financial sector moves, Sterne Agee boosts First Interstate BancSystem (FIBK +6%) to a Buy, citing the benefits of its impending merger with Mountain West Financial. The team also lifts EverBank Financial (EVER +2.4%) to a Buy from Neutral.

It's a sluggish day for the TBTFs after yesterday's post-close stress test results. Satiated investors may be selling the news, or perhaps the lenders didn't pass with enough flying colors.
Credit Suisse's Moshe Orenbuch's team had estimated a Tier 1 common ratio under the severely adverse scenario of 8.6% for Bank of America (BAC -1.5%), but it came in at just 6% from the Fed - only 100 basis points higher than the minimum. Citigroup (C -0.1%) - estimated at 10% - came in at 7%, JPMorgan (JPM +0.4%) - estimated at 6.5% - came in at 6.3%.
Morgan Stanley (MS -0.5%), meanwhile, missed CS's estimate by a whopping 400 basis points, while Goldman missed by 170. "Not surprisingly, the capital markets sensitive banks appear on the lower end of the range given losses associated with a large counterparty default, in addition to higher trading losses vs. regional bank peers," says Orenbuch.
Jefferies' Ken Usdin says the lower numbers confirm the "teeth" of the stress tests. "Our initial take is that discrepancies were largely driven by higher charge-off and balance sheet growth assumptions used by the Fed."

Half a million doesn't buy much anymore. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R, Mich.) - a sizable recipient of Wall Street donations - has the large financial institutions displeased with his proposal to levy a tax on them. He says they deserve to pay up for the lower borrowing costs they receive because of their perceived government backstop, a notion the banks dispute.
The proposal is part of larger tax reform expected to get serious discussion after the mid-term elections, and a Camp spokeswoman says the overall plan will make banks "some of the biggest winners."
In discussions to hold a fundraiser for the NRC, Goldman Sachs (GS +0.9%) reportedly opted out over its concerns. Smaller bankers join in with their much larger brethren: "We're going to beat this like a rented mule," says Cam Fine, who heads the Independent Community Bankers Association. "This is a united effort."
Camp's tax would apply to financial firms with assets greater than $500B, levying a 0.035% tax on total assets each year. Among those affected (in addition to Goldman) are AIG, BAC, C, GE Capital, JPM MET, MS, PRU, and WFC. The largest could pay more than $2B per year under the plan.

It's latest effort to try and wring revenue from its most basic banking product (and a loss leader), Bank of America (BAC +0.9%) today begins offering "Safe Balance" - a checkless account for customers with low balances for a monthly fee of $4.95. The account won't allow overdrafts, so it could make sense for those depositors whose balances sometimes fall to zero, causing them to get stuck with overdraft fees.
This effort looks to be a little more well-prepared than previous efforts in 2011 and 2012 which drew swift regulatory and customer blowback and were quickly withdrawn. "We've been doing a lot of listening to customers, doing a lot of meetings with regulators and [consumer] advocates," says BofA's Andrew Plepler. "Predictability, safety, no surprises, no hidden fees is a recurring theme."

Buying the rumor? On a flattish day for the major averages, the Too Big To Fail banks are ignoring a continued slowdown in markets revenue this quarter, and instead partying ahead of what may be the imminent release of the Fed's stress test results (perhaps Friday). About one week later will be CCAR results at which the Fed gives the thumbs up or thumbs down on the banks' capital return plans.
Word is the tests are tougher this year, but bank capital levels are also improved.
Leading today is Bank of America (BAC +3%) - now within about one percent of a 4-year high. Others: Morgan Stanley (MS +2.8%), Goldman Sachs (GS +1.8%), Ciitgroup (C +1%), JPMorgan (JPM +1.5%), and Wells Fargo (WFC +0.6%).
Also subject to the stress tests are a number of regional lenders, not to mention credit card players - they're mixed in today's action.

Atlantic Equities' Richard Staite cuts his Q1 EPS estimate for Citigroup (C +1.9%) to $1.14 from $1.40 and his full year estimate to $4.59 from $4.96, while expressing doubt about the bank's ability to hit its 2015 ROE target of 15%. He continues to have a Hold rating on the name with $55 price target
The move comes after CFO John Gerspach - speaking at an institutional investor conference on Monday  - said markets revenues this quarter were off by a high mid-teens percentage, investment banking revenue was tracking lower, and expenses headed higher.
Credit Suisse's Moshe Orenbuch cut his Q1 forecast to $1.21 from $1.41 and FY14 to $5 from $5.25. He still rates the stock an Outperform with $65 price target.
JPMorgan (JPM +0.9%) - at its investor day last week - was the first of the big banks to signal the greater-than-expected trading revenue slowdown, and KBW's Chris Mutascio lowered his Q1 EPS estimate to $1.38 from $1.43 and FY14 to $5.90 from $5.95. He's got an Outperform and $63 price target on the shares.

Under the new terms - which require shareholder approval - Bank of America (BAC) is prohibited from redeeming the $2.9B in preferred stock issued to Berkshire (BRK.A, BRK.B) for five years and the stock will continue to pay a 6% dividend. The dividends, however, will no longer be cumulative, meaning the bank won't be penalized if forced to skip a payment.
In exchange, BofA will be able to count the $2.9B as Tier 1 capital - a good deal for the bank which faces ever-more-stringent capital requirements.
Buffett originally invested $5B in BofA in 2011, acquiring the preferred stock along with warrants struck at $7.14 and expiring in 2021 allowing the purchase of 700M shares - thus far a home run.

While 400% is a big number, Citi and BofA will continue to lag their peers in terms of yield (400% growth on a penny just leads to a nickel).
Also expected to have a significant pop is Morgan Stanley (MS) - a doubling of the payout to $0.10 per share and a 1.4% yield. Others in the top 5 in increases are Zions Bancorp (ZION) with a 75% boost to $0.07 and Regions Financial (RF) up 67% to $0.05.

As for ETFs, the dividend jumps are expected to have the biggest impact on the XLF which would see a 25% increase in payout: The ETF has 81 companies, but the top 5 holdings - BofA, Wells, JPM, Citi, USB - make up 41% of assets. In contrast, just two CCAR banks make up the top five holdings of the KBE and it should see a more muted increase of just 18%.

Even as litigation has become of such material import to banks, the lenders generally don't disclose how much they've set aside for settlements and fines. The reason is clear: Whatever number that may be becomes a target for opposing attorneys.
“I definitely feel that the disclosures around this aren’t great ... I thought JPMorgan disclosing it was going to put pressure on more banks to start doing it,” says Goldman's Richard Ramsden. Most don't believe banks are sitting on catastrophically low reserves (BAC has paid in about $50B to its reserve since the financial crisis, says Bernstein), and the number can often be pieced together, but it's hard to know sometimes what banks have drawn down to settle cases.
While the SEC has asked lenders to offer better disclosure on things like European bond holdings, it has requested nothing on litigation reserves, though they're causing more financial pain than Europe is.
|Jan. 16, 2014, 3:25 PM|BofA price target hiked at Jefferies


"Positive deltas include higher NIM, better I-banking fees, and a lower tax rate, with higher revenue-related costs, less reserve release, and elevated near-term litigation costs partial offsets," says analyst Ken Usdin, raising the price target on Buy-rated Bank of America (BAC -0.6%) to $20 from $19 following yesterday's Q4 report. He lifts his 2015 EPS estimate by a nickel to $1.70 per share.
"We like BAC due to its path toward improved profitability, positive revisions, and higher normalized EPS, which should result in additional multiple expansion over time."

"You know what we know," says Bank of America (BAC +3.3%) CFO Bruce Thompson, responding to a question about the Article 77 hearing on approving/throwing out the bank's $8.5B private investor settlement over MBS. The trial is over, says Thompson, and the parties await the judge's ruling.
Mobile banking continues to take share and the number of branches - which fell to 5,151 in Q4 from 5,478 a year earlier - could drop to less than 5K by year's end, says Thompson. Mobile banking customers of 14.4M compares to 14M in Q3 and 12M a year ago. Yesterday, JPMorgan announced its dropped plans to add new branches.

It was a "very strong" quarter, says Goldman's Richard Ramsden, who puts core EPS at something closer to $0.39 (vs. his expectation for $0.31), rather than the $0.29 reported. "Even normalizing for lower market-related NII and lower reserve releases, today's result makes next year's consensus estimate of $1.32 look very achievable, particularly given remaining cost leverage from LAS and New BAC."

"We still have not approached the true earnings potential of Bank of America (BAC)," says CEO Brian Moynihan, leading off the earnings call. The bank reported EPS of $0.29, beating estimates for $0.26, but adjusting for DVA, litigation, and the artificially low tax rate brings core EPS up to $0.42, notes Hedgeye's Josh Steiner.

Declining to answer a question about the Fed stress tests and BofA's capital return plans (will the nominal $0.01 dividend be hiked this year), CFO Bruce Thompson notes the bank's Tier 1 common capital ratio is around 9%, higher than the proposed 8.5% minimum which doesn't take effect until 2019.
The bank cut 5,826 jobs in Q4 - with the cuts coming in branches and mortgage servicing/origination.
Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) investors take note: BofA's FICC revenue of $2.1B jumped 16% Y/Y. JPMorgan yesterday reported a 1% Y/Y gain vs. expectations for an 11% decline. The Street expects Goldman to report a 23% decline (after Q3's 44% tumble) and Morgan Stanley an 8% increase. Is a positive surprise looming?

Net interest income of $11B, up 4% Y/Y, with net interest margin growing to 2.56% from 2.35% a year ago.
Noninterest income of $10.7B, up 28% Y/Y, thanks to lower provisions for reps and warranties, and improvement in investment banking and brokerage income (global wealth management income of $777M, up 35%). Credit loss provisions of $336M are $1.9B lower than a year ago. Net charge offs of $1.6B in the Q compare to $3.1B a year ago.
Expense cutting remains on track: Noninterest expense of $17.3B is down 6% Y/Y, thanks to job cuts in Legacy Assets and Servicing (LAS). Full-time equivalent employees fall 9% in 2013 to 242K. This was offset by litigation expenses rising to $2.3B in Q4 from $1.1B in Q3 and $916M a year ago.
Like with Wells Fargo and JPMorgan, mortgage business continues to disappear, with first-mortgage originations falling 46% Y/Y and core production revenue falling to $403M from $986M. The difference - at least as far as with Wells Fargo - is the mortgage business makes up for a far smaller chunk of BAC's business.

"Multi-year capital/cost initiatives have prepared Bank of America (BAC) for a tougher capital regime, and its strong position supports meaningfully higher payouts vs. peers, in our view," says analyst Steven Chubak, initiating coverage with a Buy and $19 price target.
"BAC's current business mix, improving efficiency, and higher rate sensitivity should support ~15% mid-cycle returns (on required capital) by 2016. Legal costs should remain elevated, but analysis suggests BAC is only moderately under-reserved for remaining Private Label exposure. Long-term ROE potential of ~15% supports PT of $19, or 14% potential upside."
"We see unparalleled ROE potential at Citigroup (C) under the new capital rules, as Citicorp efficiency targets are realized by 2015 and Citi Holdings turns profitable," he says, starting the bank at a Buy with $70 price target.
"We also see significant excess capital generation/best-in-class payout potential as the drag from Holdings moderates and DTA utilization accelerates. The above trends support through-the-cycle ROE potential of 15% and payout ratios >100%, which are not properly reflected in the shares, in our view."

Lending growth is coming back at Back of America (BAC +0.7%) where the credit card portfolio - typically shrinking since the financial bust - grew in Q3. Don't look for the unit to return to pre-crisis size anytime soon though, as the bank has made a strategic choice to focus lending on existing customers - this saves money on marketing and assures BofA knows a little bit more about who it's doing business with. "The card business will be smaller, but less volatile and more profitable," says Titi Cole, a senior exec for retail products.
Even by focusing on its own customers, CEO Brian Moynihan reminds the opportunity is huge ... "tens of millions of customers," he told a conference late last year. The bank issued 1M new credit cards in Q3 and Q4 issuance is expected to be strong as well.

 Despite constant concerns about banks that are "too big too fail," the amount of assets that the U.S.'s five largest lenders control has grown to 44.2% of the total in the sector from 43.5% in 2012, a report from provider SNL Financial shows.
In 2007, the figure was 38.4% and in 1990 it was just 9.67%. The banking operations of JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC) and U.S. Bancorp (USB) held $6.46T in assets as of Q3 2013. The easing of regulation, which gained momentum in the 1990s, encouraged consolidation in the sector, as did the government pushing stronger banks to buy those that were about to collapse - or did collapse - because of the financial crisis in 2008.

Trading at 1.2x tangible book value, the stocks of Goldman Sachs (GS +0.1%) and Morgan Stanley (MS -0.7%) look to have mostly priced in management's ability to drive returns above cost of capital, says analyst Keith Horowitz, who nevertheless raises Goldman's PT to $195 and Morgan's to $35.
Bank of America's (BAC +2.2%) new price target of $19 "reflects a cost of equity more in line with history and no longer impacted by legacy issues."
Lazard (LAZ -0.5%) - which had a big 2013 - may do little more than tread water this year, says Horowitz, as weak M&A activity weighs on earnings.

The Fed intends to use its own estimates about the effect of a recession on bank balance sheets in its stress tests. Previously, the Fed has relied on data from the firms themselves.
The central bank could project that bank assets would grow during a slump, as has happened in the past three recessions, rather than fall, as the banks have predicted.
With such a finding, the Fed could require banks to hold more loss-absorbing capital or limit shareholder payouts. (Fed letter)

 A panoply of regulators are due to disclose the details of the Volcker rule this morning and then formally adopt the measures later in the day. The new regulations will ban banks from proprietary trading, and prevent them from owning over 3% of hedge funds and private-equity funds. Banks fear that the rules could cost them billions of dollars by making it more difficult to engage in activities that are permitted under the regulation, such as market-making, underwriting and hedging against risks. Expect the lawyers to go through the proposals to see what could be struck down in court.

The Too Big To Fail banks lead to the downside amid a report the set-to-be-voted on Volcker rule will not contain language allowing portfolio hedging - trades supposedly designed to protect against losses in a broad portfolio of assets.
Banks can thank JPMorgan's (JPM -1.7%) London Whale fiasco for this as the Whale's trades were ostensibly set up for this portfolio hedging, but ended up costing the bank $6B.
The move is a big blow to the banks which had sent their big lobbying guns in to try and prevent the disallowing of this practice. Banks often hedge to offset risks from trading with clients, but often there is no great hedge, and this is where portfolio hedging comes in ... or used to.
"Volcker has morphed a bit, thanks to the Whale," says UBS' Brennan Hawken. "Now a big component of it has become about hedging. What can you hedge, and what can't you? It's really unclear." The CFTC and SEC are each set to vote on the rule on Dec. 10.

While Holder said that the DOJ would use JPMorgan's $13B agreement as a template, he didn't provide details about which banks are in his crosshairs. Firms that have acknowledged that they are under investigation include Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS). |Dec. 4, 2013, 10:48 AM|Banks cited for non-compliance with mortgage settlement


Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C -1.3%), and JPMorgan (JPM +0.5%) each failed at least 2 of 29 metrics used to gauge compliance with the national $25B mortgage settlement, according to a court filing from Joseph Smith, the watchdog overseeing the process. The last report - filed in June - cited JPM, Citi, and Wells Fargo for missing on 3 metrics.
The failures stem from the complexity of the banks' systems, says Smith, and fixes can be expensive, but all the banks have implemented plans to address to issues.
In one example, BofA failed on one test as to whether loans were actually delinquent at the time foreclosure was initiated, and another about how quickly it was notifying borrowers of missing documents in their loan modification applications.

The CFTC sets a December 10 vote on the so-called Volcker rule which is supposed to ban banks from prop trading.

GS, MS, JPM, BAC, and C, among others, will be eager to see what the regulations entail.
Any hopes for a watering-down of the rule likely ended with JPMorgan's $6B London Whale loss.
The SEC indicates it will act on the rule around the same time as the CFTC (3 other agencies must approve as well).

|Dec. 3, 2013, 11:13 AM|Banks expect to make mortgages outside of new standard


The nation's largest retail banks - WFC, BAC, C, and JPM - all expect to originate mortgages beginning in January falling outside of the standards mandated by Washington. To review, Dodd-Frank doesn't prohibit mortgages not meeting the definition of a so-called qualified mortgage (as defined by the CFPB), but banks can face greater legal liability on those loans.
The impact of the new rules has yet to be seen, but the worry is they would curtail lending at the exact time when it ought to be encouraged. At this point, the bank's lending outside of these standards looks like it will be mostly to affluent customers (jumbo mortgages), and not a large proportion of total activity. Wells estimates about 5% of its lending this year wouldn't fall within QM guidelines.
Wells' EVP of home mortgages Brad Blackwell: "It's clear the borrowers we're lending to today have an ability to repay ... We don't see a significant reason to contract our lending...because these are very high-quality borrowers."
Deutsche estimates 13% of jumbo loans made since 2010 wouldn't be "qualified" mortgages.

The good news is banks have gotten ahead of even these crazy numbers by boosting litigation reserves to nearly $155B.
The bad news would be if Bank of America's (BAC) $8.5B mortgage settlement with private parties gets tossed out by a federal judge (see Article 77 hearing coverage), the litigation losses could "escalate significantly ...  the ability of US banks with the largest exposures to withstand additional expenses is not unlimited.”

C, WFC, MS, JPM, and GS declined to comment for the story.
From the Department of Legal Issues Are Going Nowhere: The Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh - claiming its losses of more than $1B are not covered by the JPMorgan global settlement - asks a judge to force JPM to turn over the draft complain from the DOJ which includes the name of a bank employee described as a cooperating witness for the government.
