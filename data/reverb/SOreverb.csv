 Southern Co.

The firm says the opportunities stem from Southern Power, Southern Co.

 Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) may be positioning to raise its reduced dividend and resume share buybacks after the $1.47B sale of half its stake in the Southern Natural Gas pipeline system. The ratio of KMI’s debt to EBITDA probably will fall to 5.3x by year-end, below the company’s previous target of 5.5x, shrinking the debt load and freeing up cash that could be used to expand investor payouts, repurchase shares or pay down additional obligations, CFO Kimberly Dang said today during a conference call following the sale news.
At first blush, the deal looks like a steal for Southern Co. (NYSE:SO), working out to a ~11.6x EV/EBITDA multiple vs.  the 12x-14x a regulated pipeline would fetch in the current market, but KMI expects to make up for the shortfall with  investment opportunities coming off the pipeline, taking pains to frame the deal as the start of a deeper partnership aimed at growing the SNG system.

 S&P places its ratings for Southern Co. (NYSE:SO) on Credit Watch negative after Mississippi regulators yesterday ordered SO's Mississippi Power subsidiary to lower rates later this month and plan for customer refunds by November. The Public Service Commission order complies with a state Supreme Court order that found a 2013 rate increase for the $6.2B Kemper County plant was illegal. With interest, ~$350M is due to the company's 186K customers; an average 1,000 Kwh/month residential  customer would receive $500-$600. S&P says the order suggests ""a deteriorating regulatory relationship with the company [that] raises the probability of lower ratings if MPC is required to fully roll back that rate increase and make full, immediate refunds.""
Kemper's costs have significantly exceeded original estimates, and more than $2B has been written off as unrecoverable.

 An agreement by Mississippi electric power cooperatives to cost-share 15% of Southern Co.'s (NYSE:SO) $6.2B clean coal plant in Kemper County has been abandoned after the cooperatives' power purchasing entity decided the power to be delivered from the Kemper plant would be too costly. SO in turn notified state regulators it may have to raise electricity rates for Mississippi power customers by 41%, or $37/month for the typical household, to pay for the project. It is unclear what the decision will mean for SO, whose stock value and reputation both in Mississippi and  nationally are riding partly on the plant that was expected to provide a bright future for the embattled coal industry but instead has exposed the risks of pursuing novel clean-coal technology.

 Georgia state regulators say there's a ""high probability"" that Southern Co.'s (SO -0.3%) Vogtle nuclear plant now under construction will be delayed even longer than the expected three years, according to an AP report. SO subsidiary Georgia Power and its co-owners are building two more nuclear reactors at Vogtle in eastern Georgia, but earlier this year the consortium designing and building the plant - Westinghouse and  Chicago Bridge & Iron (CBI +5.9%) - said the construction schedule would be delayed by more than three years; those companies remain locked in a legal dispute about who should pay the resulting costs. That schedule may prove a best-case scenario, according to a recent analysis by a nuclear engineer working with utility regulators at the Georgia Public Service Commission.

Coal imports to the U.S. surged 44% Y/Y to 5.4M metric tons during the first six months of 2014, even as coal mines close throughout central Appalachia.

Appalachian miners such as Alpha Natural Resources (NYSE:ANR) say imports from Colombia have added to their troubles; Colombia produces a high quality thermal coal, it's inexpensive to mine it, and relatively inexpensive to ship it to the U.S. east coast.
The cheaper imports benefit some utilities such as Southern Co. (NYSE:SO), which has 63 coal-fired power generating units in four states and bought 25% more imported coal than expected.

 Walter Energy (WLT -6.3%) shares aren't helped by the coal producer's statement that new EPA proposals aimed at controlling carbon emissions from U.S. power plants should have no material impact on the company; in fact, WLT is down more than peers: CNX +1.1%, BTU +0.1%, CLD -0.3%, ACI -2.8%, ANR -4.6%.

""Subsidies and falling technology costs are making distributed solar  power cost-competitive [and] as more people  switch to solar, utilities sell less electricity to those customers [causing the] utilities [to] spread their high fixed costs ... over fewer kilowatt-hours, making solar power even more  competitive and pushing more people to adopt it,"" WSJ's Liam Denning notes, describing what is dubbed ""the death-spiral thesis"" for traditional utilities.
Denning says it's the merchant generators (like NRG) that have the most to worry about: ""For regulated utilities, the idea that solar panels will enable everyone  to leave the grid, making such networks redundant, is overstated.""
Although the threat may seem distant for now, Denning says it's worth taking seriously if you're an investor. ""The gyres may look exceedingly wide, but that spiral is taking shape,"" he says.
