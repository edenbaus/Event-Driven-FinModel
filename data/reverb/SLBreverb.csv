""The likely recovery in our activity levels now seems to be a 2017 event,” the CEO said, as E&P companies have indicated they plan to  cut spending next year but have not finalized their budgets, making  it difficult for services firms to predict how much further activity  could fall.

 Analysts say Schlumberger’s (SLB -4.2%) acquisition of Cameron International (CAM +41.7%) is not particularly surprising, given SLB's two years of experience working alongside CAM through their OneSubsea joint venture and track record of soaking up JV partners. The combination effectively allows the two companies to extract the type of cost savings found at OneSubsea across the rest of their businesses; SLB thinks it can find pretax benefits of $600M in the second year after the deal, most of which will come from cost-cutting. Citigroup says the deal will firmly establish SLB as the dominant and most diversified oilfield service provider, with total estimated revenues for the combined entity of $46B in 2015, a figure the prospective Halliburton (HAL +2.3%) and Baker Hughes (BHI +2.5%) combo cannot match.

Margins and revenues of the biggest oil services companies such as Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) and Weatherford (NYSE:WFT) likely will remain at risk globally through 2016 due to the severity of the downturn in offshore and deepwater drilling, Wells Fargo says.
