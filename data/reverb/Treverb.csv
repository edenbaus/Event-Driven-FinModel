The price on a DirecTV Now package of 60-plus channels is $35/month; AT&T also offers 80-plus channels for $50/month and 120-plus channels for $70/month; its 100-plus channel package is $35 now and reverts to $60/month on Monday. Hulu's $40 price will include the basic on-demand subscription that Hulu offers separately for $8 a month, along with a cloud DVR service at launch time. DirecTV Now lacks both DVR functionality and a CBS deal. Meanwhile, Hulu lacks a deal with NBCUniversal, though that company is a part-owner of Hulu, so an agreement isn't expected to be a major hurdle. Hulu owners: CMCSA, DIS, FOX/FOXA, TWX.

 In an extraordinary move, the Justice Dept. is suing AT&T (T -0.3%), charging that its DirecTV unit led a campaign to illegally block carriage of the Los Angeles Dodgers' TV channel. In the suit, the DOJ says DirecTV led an effort with then-separate AT&T, and Cox Communications and Charter Communications (CHTR +0.6%), to refuse carriage of Dodgers-owned SportsNet LA, sharing nonpublic information to do so -- all to gain bargaining power with Time Warner Cable (itself now part of Charter). DirecTV and Cox have balked at the cost of carrying the channel, and its struggles have been well documented as Southern Californians labored to find how to watch the Dodgers on television.

The deal -- which would create a media/telecom giant that would reshape the industry -- would be likely cash and stock, though talks are fluid and might not end in a deal. The mix of the deal is likely crucial to its outcome, with Time Warner (not to be confused with Time Warner Cable, now part of Charter Communications) now worth more than $75B -- and a year after AT&T ponied up nearly $49B to take over DirecTV.

 In meetings discussing a potential AT&T (NYSE:T) merger with Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), AT&T execs have found a willing seller in Time Warner chief Jeff Bewkes, sources tell Bloomberg, so long as he sees an offer he thinks is fair. And AT&T is on the hunt for content as part of a company transformation that has included its takeover of DirecTV (for an also-whopping $48.5B). The two companies met in recent weeks to talk about various strategies in discussions characterized as informal and focused on building relations at the moment, Bloomberg says. Nobody's hired a financial adviser yet. Time Warner famously rejected a 2014 bid from Rupert Murdoch and Fox (at $85/share) that valued the company at more than $75B; it's worth about $64.5B in market cap today accounting for today's gain. A deal makes sense, says Albert Fried analyst Rich Tullo, with 5G mobile on the way and AT&T set to benefit from a great content catalog at Time Warner.

 A new FCC draft order circulating to regulate pay TV's approach to set-top devices has left questions over just how comprehensive the changes would be. Chairman Tom Wheeler's fact sheet about the rules laid out how providers would need to create apps enabling consumers to see all the content they paid for on their own devices, without paying expensive rental fees for a box. (The FCC estimates Americans spend $20B on box leasing fees that have jumped 185% since 1994, a period during which other consumer electronics have fallen 90% in price.) Top pay TV providers (those serving about 95% of the subscriber population) will need to comply with the new rules within two years if they're adopted in a Sept. 29 vote. As for platforms, Wheeler's fact sheet singled out Roku, iOS/Android and Windows, but any operating system with U.S. shipments of at least 5M devices qualifies to have an app written for it by providers. Devices would also meet the requirement if they're already built on a qualifying platform (such as on Android). Alternately, smaller device providers could strike their own deals with providers (such as with Comcast's Xfinity TV Partner Program) to get access to the apps.

Keys to the new order: Providers will have to offer a free app for subscribers to access all the programming they pay for on a variety of devices, ""including tablets, smartphones, gaming systems, streaming devices or smart TVs."" And consumers won't be forced to pay monthly rental fees for a box. Providers will also have to make their apps available to popular platforms including Roku, iOS/Android and Windows.

SNL Kagan sees a moderation in the cord-cutting trend, noting the ""rate of decline stayed about constant versus the past couple of quarters."" Meanwhile, at least some key companies are responding to the change: Even as pay TV bundle customers decline, they can see big new residential revenues from upticks in broadband Internet subscriptions. The firm forecasts broadband subscriptions will swell by more than 8M over 10 years, hitting 71M (ending up at 1.6 times the video sub numbers). Meanwhile, basic video subscriptions are expected to drop by annual compounded growth rate of 1.5% (to 45.4M by 2026), slower than last year's expected 1.7% decline, SNL Kagan says. It expects residential revenues to rise from $108.38B this year to $117.7B in 2016, and contributions from commercial services to push industry revenue from $130.57B today to $140.99B in 2026. On the other hand, Jan Dawson at Jackdaw Research warns that more people are cord-cutting than you think, pointing to six straight quarters of Y/Y declines in pay TV subs. ""I’ve lost track of how many headlines I’ve seen over the last couple of years which posit that cord-cutting is somehow slowing down off the back of a small number of providers’ quarterly results,"" Dawson says, mainly due to observers focusing on quarterly net adds rather than annual changes, and looking at too small a sample size. Cable players have done well lately, but at the expense of telcos -- and even in cable, it's an example of the rich getting richer, with smaller players suffering. And Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) is seeing worsening results despite its creation of streaming service Sling TV.

The goal is to launch the service by the end of the year, including content BAMTech has already licensed from MLB and NHL; ""We will add content that ESPN has licensed, college sports, football, basketball, tennis, rugby, cricket,"" but it will be content ESPN licensed that isn't already on the existing channels. Meanwhile, the Disney bundle in full will be part of all packages in DirecTV Now (NYSE:T), AT&T's streaming service coming in Q4, Iger says. That includes ESPN, ESPN 2, ABC, Freeform, Disney Channel, Disney XD, and Disney Junior. The June 16 grand opening of the park in Shanghai was ""a spectacular success by any measure,"" Iger says. ""We built something that was very complex and very large and it opened flawlessly.""

 The FCC has set the cost of the spectrum being sold in the broadcast spectrum incentive auction at a whopping $86.4B -- a sum that wireless carriers may balk at. That means that the FCC might have to sell less spectrum than had been expected, or use multiple rounds to settle bidding by broadcasters. The current stage is the reverse auction, where broadcasters bid low to give up their low-band airwaves to the FCC -- and participation has been strong from broadcasters who might have ""significantly inflated expectations,"" says analyst Roger Entner. That's to be followed by a forward auction round of bidding by carriers. A second round of reverse auction with the broadcasters may be needed, which could slow the entire process into 2017.

 With tomorrow's deadline arriving for bidders for core assets of Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO), the long-shot bid of Time Inc. (NYSE:TIME) won't be among them, as the company decided fixing the business was too big a task, The Wall Street Journal reports. (It would have also faced severe leveraging trying to swallow the business.) With a number of bidders bowing out as expected, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is indeed a front-runner among the few firms moving forward. Aligning somewhat with a number of other media reports (and rumors), now bowing out for sure are Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), AT&T (NYSE:T) and IAC/InteractiveCorp (NASDAQ:IAC), the Journal says.

At Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Chief Strategy Officer John Donovan said the technology -- which promises download speeds of up to 10 Gbps on a network handling billions of devices -- will need a solid fixed line backbone.

 In a party-line vote, the FCC has voted to proceed on new regulations that will allow for open competition in pay TV set-top boxes. Agency Chairman Tom Wheeler had railed against a market where he says Americans spend $20B on leasing devices from their TV providers, paying rental fees that have jumped 185% since 1994 despite the fact that other consumer electronics have declined 90% in price in the same time frame. The FCC's move could throw open the doors to a new generation of boxes from the likes of Apple and Alphabet as well as TiVo, among others. “This issue is not complex,” Wheeler says, noting that the 1996 Telecommunications Act “explicitly instructed us to assure that there are competitive information devices, be it a box or an app.”
Voting on Wheeler's proposal is the start of a process. If a final order goes forward, MVPDs would have to provide information to third parties who could make devices that conformed to a specification to provide service.

The paper adds AT&T (NYSE:T) and InterActiveCorp (NASDAQ:IAC) ""are also believed to be examining the company.""
Many firms are expected to make full or partial bids for core Yahoo. CFO Ken Goldman: ""A number of companies have said they want to look at us, and there are a number of private equity firms that are interested in looking at us. I’m not saying that we’ve received offers ... I’m saying parties have expressed interest in us. And what we’re saying is that we’ll be open [to] that.”

Meanwhile, with a sale effort and job cuts already expected, Yahoo fell below $28 in regular trading following its Q4 report and myriad of job cut, writedown, and strategic review announcements. Weak guidance may have weighed: Yahoo guided in its earnings slides (.pdf) for Q1 GAAP revenue of $1.05B-$1.09B and 2016 revenue of $4.4B-$4.6B, below consensus estimates of $1.14B and $4.78B.2016 ex-TAC revenue guidance of $3.4B-$3.6B is below 2015 ex-TAC revenue of $4.09B, which itself was below 2014's $4.4B. Non-GAAP op. income is  expected to drop to $150M-$250M from 2015's $342M and 2014's $755M.
Also of note: 1) $230M of Yahoo's $4.46B goodwill writedown was related to the $1.1B Tumblr acquisition. On the earnings call (transcript), Yahoo disclosed Tumblr failed to hit the company's $100M 2015 revenue target. 2) Along with everything else, Yahoo has begun exploring the sale of ""non-strategic assets"" such as patents and real estate.

The company has gotten more active on cross-promotion, with a deal to reinstate unlimited wireless data (and unlimited video streaming) for customers who sign up for TV (U-verse or DirecTV), using a block of unused spectrum. The company hasn't said how long they would keep that offer open. As for managing the cost of video demands over LTE: ""Satellite is the most efficient video delivery technology known to man. Fiber being next, wireless probably being the highest. But at this stage, we're in a unique position by virtue of having the spectrum portfolio we have and so it's a position we're going to take advantage of."" He also sounded an upbeat tone about the company's moves in Mexico: ""We came in and acquired two companies in Mexico, to go back into that market,"" he says. ""Each of those deals were done in 30, 45 days ... it's an environment very receptive to investment, and the new regulatory environment they put in place gives us a lot of confidence."" The company's investing in its nationwide LTE network there, he says: It's already deployed LTE to 40M people and will ultimately get LTE to 100M people in Mexico.

 While speculation about buyers for Yahoo's (NASDAQ:YHOO) core Internet business is focused on private equity, Yahoo's evolution as a media company means a number of media/telecom firms are in play for all or part of the business. A sale of the core business might not happen -- it's not the main purpose of Yahoo's meeting -- but on the other hand, a transaction would certainly value it at more than where it is locked up in Yahoo, which may be less than zero because of the investments in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan. Estimates vary widely on the Internet business' value, from just under $2B to as much as near $4B. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) could have room for that after it failed to acquire Time Warner Cable; it's been spreading out investments in a number of media and Internet companies this year, and it could lump in Yahoo's properties with its own Xfinity online video.

The moves are part of AT&T's longer-term strategy to end up with a North American service area -- which has rivals moving to offer their own ""borderless"" promotions and plans. AT&T's moves into Mexico were spurred by the country's government, which acted to favor challenges to dominant America Movil (AMX +2.7%), and Arroyo stuck up for the regulations that the lead carrier was facing: “Things haven’t changed a lot.

 While a federal court sided with the FCC yesterday -- and thus against AT&T (NYSE:T), in its litigation against net neutrality regulations -- is it really a silver lining for the big telecom? Analysts say with tough new rules taking effect today, the FCC has less reason to set tougher conditions on AT&T's proposed deal to acquire DirecTV (NASDAQ:DTV). ""Now that the net neutrality rules are set to go into effect today for all carriers, there probably isn't as much pressure for the FCC to attempt to single AT&T out or get AT&T to proactively agree to abide by stricter net neutrality rules,"" says Elevation's Stephen Sweeney, ""so this may simplify the ongoing remedy/concessions negotiations that are ongoing with the regulators at the moment."" Earlier this month, sources pointed to an AT&T ready to make concessions, including agreement to strict guidelines on net neutrality, in order to get the deal done. ""The ruling (may be) a positive for AT&T-DirecTV because the FCC probably will face less pressure from public interest groups to apply the full net neutrality rules to AT&T as a merger condition (which might have been the case if the court had blocked the FCC's Title II ruling),"" says Guggenheim's Paul Gallant.

 AT&T (NYSE:T) has urged the FCC to put a cap on wireless spectrum-auction bidding credits of $10M for designated entities ((DEs)), the companies funded by bigger firms that can bid on their behalf and earn small-business credits. Competitors have been harshly competitive of Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH), who used two DEs in the AWS-3 auction to apply for $3B in bidding credits, effectively winning $13.3B in spectrum for just $10B in bids. The FCC is scrutinizing those credits, and a $10M cap would have effectively invalidated Dish's strategy. Meanwhile, the FCC is reportedly circulating a draft order for the 2016 broadcast incentive auction that is almost unchanged from the original, despite entreaties from various firms/groups (also including Verizon (NYSE:VZ)) for changes.

And when the video numbers turn, DTV will start to suffer, especially if anything gets in the way of its tie-up with AT&T (NYSE:T).

The company introduced that package after Dish Network launched its $20/month Sling TV.

The offer is ""compelling"" on price and technology and could make a monetary difference if device support grows, but it's more likely about carriers making Fi's practices mainstream, he says.

Though Softcard's owners have invested hundreds of millions in the venture, sources state Google's purchase price could be below $100M.
Like Apple Pay and Google Wallet, Softcard relies on NFC radios to enable transactions. And like Wallet, it has struggled to get off the ground, as U.S. consumers overwhelmingly stick with card swipes. Hard data on Apple Pay usage remains limited for now.
Softcard recently laid off 60 employees. Meanwhile, it was reported in 2013 that Google had spent $300M on Wallet-related acquisitions, with little to show for it. The adoption of EMV (chip-and-PIN) readers by U.S. retailers could give NFC solutions a boost, by making card payments a little less convenient.

The network, mandated by Mexico's 2013 telecom reform bill, aims to allow America Movil's (AMX -0.6%) rivals (such as Iusacell) to provide better coverage without having to rely on AMX, which is still looking for a buyer for the Mexican assets it's shedding to bring its share below 50%.
