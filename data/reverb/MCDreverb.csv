 The restaurant industry is adjusting to higher labor costs with additional surcharges on customer bills of 3% to 4% in some areas.

The extra costs are cutting into the narrow margins for many restaurant chains.The risk for operators is that consumers will push back amid what's already a pressured backdrop for traffic at dine-in restaurants.

Wages: ""Higher minimum wages as a result of legislation continues to remain a headwind for the industry, with an additional 18 states implementing minimum wage increases that took effect 12/31/16 of 1/1/17.

 Retail sales topped expectations in May with some categories tipping off a healthy spending trend. Nonstore retailers once again led all categories with 12% Y/Y growth. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) had a lot to say with that strong performance. Health and personal care stores were also solid with an 8% Y/Y rise in sales. Chains such as Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA), Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD), Ulta Salon (NASDAQ:ULTA), and Sally Beauty Holdings (NYSE:SBH) continue to draw millennial interest. Department stores lagged once again with a 0.9% M/M drop and 6% Y/Y tail-off. A tough month of weather contributed to a 2% M/M drop in the building materials and garden equipment (HD, LOW) category. Restaurants performed ahead of expectations, sales were up 0.8% M/M and 6.5% Y/Y.  That mark bodes well for McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) continuing its streak of staying in positive territory with comparable-store sales.

 Same-store sales at chain restaurants fell 0.3% Y/Y in May to record the third consecutive month of negative growth, according to data from Black Box Intelligence.

 Nation's Restaurant News points to a trend that may explain some of the weakness with restaurant traffic this year. Restaurants have been pushing prices higher over the last six months, despite lower retail food costs. On the other hand, grocery stores have lowered their prices in accordance with some easing of chicken, beef, and pork costs. It's a pricing spread that consumers may have caught on to if broad traffic trends are an indicator. Rising labor costs are the most obvious reason for the disparity. Restaurants expend about 30% of sales on labor costs, while groceries only spend about 14%.

 Impossible Foods aims to disrupt the food industry by developing meat products from plant-based ingredients. Launched by a top biochemist from Stanford, the startup says it's on the verge of offering meat lovers an alternative that looks, smells, and even sizzles (video) like regular ground beef. Science timeout: Impossible honed in on a molecule called heme that catalyzes the flavors in meat. A legume-derived heme-containing protein is put to the task of creating the meat taste that even top chefs have raved about. The first Impossible Burgers are expected to be launched this year in the U.S. Notable names are taking in an interest in the concept. During the last venture capital round, Impossible brought in fresh funds from Bill Gates and Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing. Former Nest/Google exec Tony Fadell is also an angel investor. Impossible Foods CEO Patrick Brown confirmed at Recode's Code conference that the company turned down an offer from Google (pre-Alphabet split) for somewhere between $200M and $300M. If the startup were to ramp up at scale, the development might be something to watch for meat giants such as Cargill, Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN), JBS (OTC:JBSAF), and National Beef Packaging Company (NYSE:LUK). Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) and Kellogg (NYSE:K) are already active in the frozen veggie burger category, while Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM) has been dabbling with indie brands. There's also an interesting tie-in with McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) looking to appeal to millennials and Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) working on developing a ""better burger"" concept.

 McDonald's (MCD +0.1%) is the focus of the restaurant industry today as its annual meeting in Chicago takes place amid protests over wage levels. Though execs with the company are saying all the right things inside the event, former McDonald's USA CEO Ed Rensi went off script during an engaging interview on Fox Business News that delved into the issue of wage levels. ""I was at the National Restaurant Show yesterday and if you look at the robotic devices that are coming into the restaurant industry -- it’s cheaper to buy a $35,000 robotic arm than it is to hire an employee who’s inefficient making $15 an hour bagging French fries,"" noted Rensi.
Robot automation R&D in the U.S. has accelerated over the last couple of years with the restaurant industry front and center, although no major chain has tackled the political hot potato of announcing robot-influenced job reductions.
If there's any question that automation can't help in certain industries, Adidas may have settled that with its dramatic announcement this week that it planned to pull shoe production out of Asia for robot facilities in Europe and the U.S.
Early talk from management at the McDonald's event has been centered on test programs being rolled out and the localization push by the chain.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch raises its price target on Buy-rated McDonald's (MCD -0.1%) to $140 (Street high along with Argus).
The PT lift is based off of higher EPS estimates on McDonald's for 2016 ($5.45) and 2017 ($6.25).
BAML sees the restaurant operator reporting Q1 U.S. comparable-store sales growth of 4%, but expects EPS to just miss the consensus. Those numbers are spilled on Friday.

The tally includes lost productivity and a lower level of consumer spending over the duration of the storm - even after factoring in the impact of consumers stockpiling from chains such as Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Lowe's (NYSE:LOW), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), and Kroger (NYSE:KR).
The storm is broad enough to impact domestic traffic numbers for restaurant chains (MCD, QSR, WEN, CMG, DENN, DNKN, SBUX) and movie theater operators (RGC, CKEC, CNK, AMC).
The number of cancelled flights tied to the storm is tracking rapidly toward 10K. U.S. airlines (LUV, AAL, JBLU, UAL, DAL) have become more efficient with managing major storms, but will still take a hit to Q1 revenue.
Looking ahead: Though harsh U.S. winters have lopped off as much as 1% to 2% from retail sales in the past, the 2015-2016 season still sits comfortably in the historical range used by economists when making their projections.

Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) has raised prices in the San Francisco area by an average of 10.5% to help offset higher wages the chain is paying out in the region.
The minimum wage in San Francisco increased to $12.25/hr in May after sitting at $10.74/hr. The double-digit rise in prices at San Francisco-area Chipotle outlets compared to only a 0.5% increase across the U.S. for the company.
Restaurant industry watchers are busy analyzing the impact of minimum wage hikes in San Francisco, Los Angeles ($15), Seattle ($15), and other cities along with the proposed hikes in 29 states (DOL list). The ability to pass off some of the wage burden is crucial with restaurants generating a good portion of their sales growth through higher average guest spending, instead of bustling traffic.
What to watch: Though wage pressure is a factor for almost all companies in the restaurant sector, analysts note price elasticity varies widely by chain. Chipotle, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) are expected to continue to ease past price hikes without a high correlation on demand, while smaller chains or privately-owned restaurants could be hit the hardest. Dine-in chains like Denny's (NASDAQ:DENN), Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (NASDAQ:RRGB), and IHOP (NYSE:DIN) are also expected to feel a pinch.
Burger watch: The rise of competition in the hamburger segment impacts price elasticity negatively for players like Shake Shake (NYSE:SHAK), Habit Restaurants (NASDAQ:HABT), Sonic (NASDAQ:SONC), Burger King (NYSE:QSR), Jack in the Box (NASDAQ:JACK) and Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) - while at the top of the heap the timing is tricky for McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) to become too aggressive with price increases amid its turnaround charge.

 A difficult decision is coming for McDonald's (MCD -0.4%) with a new leadership team now in place.
The restaurant chain has announced an ambitious Create Your Taste program which will allow consumers to customize their orders. The costly initiative is aimed at creating a fast-casual feel which will draw in millennials, but at the risk of worsening store execution and creating a mixed message globally.
If the company sticks with the plan, it might be without the full backing of franchisees. There's a growing number of reports indicating that franchisees back a McDonald's strategy of dropping attempts to clone Starbucks or Chipotle to focus on burgers and fries with a smaller menu.

 The CEO change at McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) is a signal to investors the company is serious about changing the status quo, according to analysts. The restaurant giant, which is coming off a 4.1% comp slide in 2014 and has already warned on pressure through the first half of the year, has also hired a new CFO and created a Chief Administrative Officer position. Much of the skepticism over the ability of the 36K-store chain to grow sales again hinges on a brand viewed by consumers as in decline (bloated menu, poor service, unhealthy) and being passed over by millennials.

 Analysts note McDonald's is not a bellwether stock for the restaurant industry anymore as the sector has many more names putting in gains today than losses despite the poor sales report from the Golden Arches. The quick (and perhaps obvious) take from within the sector is that chains sticking with a simple laser-focused message are winning out. Chipotle, Wendy's, and Domino's all fit that description. The copycat approach of McDonald's (McCafe, wings, premium burgers) and Olive Garden (prior to Starboard) hasn't worked, while a measured pace to expansion in new markets has also paid off (Starbucks vs. KFC).

 Analysts with Gasbuddy.com predict some gas stations in the U.S. will offer $2 per gallon gas by Christmas. The last time the average price of gas in the U.S. was below $2 was in March of 2009.
