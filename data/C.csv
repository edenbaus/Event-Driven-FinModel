The top five places in the global investment banking league table now firmly belong to U.S. banks, according to industry analytics firm Coalition, reflecting their domination over struggling European peers.The gap has widened consistently since 2011, when the U.S.-European split was roughly 50-50.American banks now take in around a two-thirds share of the investment banking revenue pie.Tickers by scores: JPM, C, GS, BAC, MS, DB, BCS, CS, HSBC|Yesterday, 12:09 PM|Bank bulls bail; BofA -4.5% leads decline: Kass says "short"

"Group stink has never been more conspicuous than in financial sector stocks," says Doug Kass, calling the top in the piping hot names.A strong economy, eased regulation, and higher interest rates have all been fully baked into valuations, says Kass, but being ignored: signs of a slowing economy, peaking auto sales, growing protectionism, and valuations at pre-crisis levels.Then there's the housing market, and it's "reached an inflection point in price and activity," says Kass. He notes prices of higher-end West and East coast homes have turned lower - usually a bell-ringer for the residential housing cycle.Favored shorts: MetLife (MET -1.1%), Lincoln Financial (LNC -2.9%), Goldman Sachs (GS -2%), Morgan Stanley (MS -2.7%).

There's nothing too new in Janet Yellen's 2nd day on Capital Hill. As with yesterday, she's giving off a more hawkish vibe than at least some may have expected. The 10-year Treasury yield is higher by three basis points to 2.50%, and Fed Funds futures are now pricing in nearly a 50% chance of a March rate hike (up from less than 25% a few days back).The Fed boss is naturally offering a defense of the current regulatory regime, including the Volcker Rule and the CCAR, but the Trump administration, its now-confirmed Treasury Secretary and the leaders of key congressional committees are working to roll back much of Dodd-Frank.XLF (XLF +0.6%), KBE (KBE +0.4%), KRE (KRE +0.2%)Bank of America (BAC +2.2%), Goldman Sachs (GS +0.8%), Citigroup (C +1.2%), Morgan Stanley (MS +1.1%), Wells Fargo (WFC +0.9%), JPMorgan (JPM +0.9%)|Tue, Feb. 14, 11:01 AM|Dollar, banks on the move as Yellen leans hawkish

Writing in the WSJ last night, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee called the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau a rogue agency, purposely created to be insulated from Congressional, presidential, or voter oversight."The regulatory web spun by the CFPB can make every provider of financial services guilty until proven innocent, inviting selective enforcement and financial shakedowns."He notes Dodd-Frank specifically excluded auto lenders from CFPB jurisdiction, but that hasn't stopped Richard Cordray (CFPB chief) and company, as the likes of Santander Consumer (SC +1.2%), Ally Financial (ALLY +1%), and Credit Acceptance Corp. (CACC +1.9%) have found out. The House two years ago voted overwhelmingly voted to stop the CFPB's efforts in this area, but Elizabeth Warren was able to halt the bill in the Senate.The president, says Hensarling, should fire Richard Cordray yesterday, put in place a new director to undo all harmful actions taken by the agency, and then get to work putting policies to work that actually protect consumers.Even with better leadership, though, the CFPB would still be unconstitutional, he continues, so the agency must be "functionally terminated" through a simple majority vote to cut off funding (which comes from the Fed, not Congress).In other Hensarling news, Bloomberg has seen a memo outlining other Dodd-Frank reforms, including reducing stress tests to just every other year.XLF +1.3%, KRE +1.5%, KBE +1.3%OneMain (OMF +4.4%), BofA (BAC +1.6%), Citigroup (C +1.7%), Wells Fargo (WFC +1.7%), JPMorgan (JPM +1.3%), Goldman Sachs (GS +1.7%), Morgan Stanley (MS +2.2%), Regions (RF +2.7%), KeyCorp (KEY +1%), SunTrust (STI +1.6%), BB&T (BBT +1.1%), M&T (MTB +1.2%), Zions (ZION +2%)|Thu, Feb. 9, 6:07 AM|Fiduciary rule still in focus

 The Fed votes to adopt a bailout prevention rule that will force big banks to issue substantial amounts of new long-term debt, largely upholding a draft issued early this year. Half of the eight largest U.S. banks would need to issue ~$70B in fresh debt or equity to satisfy the new Total Loss Absorbing Capacity standard, the Fed estimates. In all, the Fed says U.S. banks’ funding costs would increase by $680M-$2B annually, higher than the upper estimate of $1.5B in its October 2015 proposal. Fed officials do not identify the four banks that lack sufficient debt; Wells Fargo (WFC +1.6%) said in November it envisioned issuing at least an additional $29B in debt to satisfy the rule.

Today's rate hike and hawkish expectations for 2017 may have marked the top of the bank rally, he says. Not all higher rates are created equal, and if Fed rate boosts flatten the yield curve, it wouldn't be good for bank margins, he says.

Whether she get another four-year term after that, or simply moves back to the Board of Governors is a question for another day.2:59 ET Asked how she feels about the president elect's views on easing big chunks of post-crisis financial regulation, Yellen says she's thinks D.C. (Fed included) has done a good job of insuring against a repeat, and wouldn't be a fan of a big rollback. She does think the burden on smaller institutions needs to be relieved. As for any contact with the Trump team, Yellen says it's only been at the staff level and only to help ensure a smooth transition.2:53 ET I'm not trying to give advice to the incoming administration, says Yellen, after opining that additional fiscal stimulus at this point is probably not necessary to get the economy back to full employment.2:50 ET Up sharply in the immediate aftermath of the Fed rate hike and more hawkish expectations for next year, the banks have given up those gains, and turned lower. The KBE is down 0.4%.2:46 ET Asked by CNBC's Steve Liesman if plans for big fiscal spending and tax cuts would alter the Fed's plans, Yellen says she won't speculate on their impact without more details. Some at the central bank, however, did incorporate greater fiscal stimulus in their forecasts, she says.2:43 ET First questioner wants to know if the Fed hiked rates because Trump was elected. Yellen isn't biting, and notes today's hike, along with the more hawkish "dots" are just modest adjustements.2:40 ET Continued moderate economic growth will warrant "gradual tightening," but the outlook is "highly uncertain" and the path of fiscal policy is unknown.2:34 ET The post-FOMC meeting press conference is getting underway.

Customers of offerings like JPMorgan's (NYSE:JPM) Sapphire Reserve card can't believe their good fortune, but bank shareholders can't be faulted for wondering whether there's going to be any profits from the growing rewards war."You have five or six big national players and they are going around killing one another," says Oppenheimer's Chris Kotowski.It's the banking version of a loss leader.

"Large banks are going to be forced to take on more capital," says Dick Bove. "It will make the cost of funding more, not less, expensive. It will reduce the appeal for investors to put money at risk in the banking system."
Bove is commenting on a weekend announcement from Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo promising future stress tests will be geared to demanding even higher cash buffers for banks. Set to take effect next year, the new rule could raise capital requirements for the largest banks by 3 or 4 percentage points, writes Jeff Cox at CNBC.

The payoff: It was chosen as lead advisor on Saudi Arabia's first international bond sale next month which could be for up to $10B.

The head of the CFPB was on the tape earlier saying the Wells Fargo (WFC -3.1%) account opening case isn't a signal of a broader problem in the industry, but Cowen's Jaret Seiberg says not to underestimate the political risk to the likes of Wells, Bank of America (BAC -1.8%), Citigroup (C -1.9%), and JPMorgan (JPM -1.2%). With extra ammunition given to the "break up the banks crowd," this is no longer a negligible risk.
Wells Fargo has enjoyed special status compared to the other mega banks since the financial crisis, says Seiberg, but "life [is] about to get worse" for Warren Buffett's favorite. The bank, says Seiberg, will no longer get the benefit of the doubt. "[The] fall from golden child to problem child can be difficult and expensive."
The Senate Banking Committee is set to hold a hearing on the Wells Fargo matter on Sept. 20.
As for the industry as a whole, Treasury Sec. Jack Lew took to the Delivering Alpha conference this morning to wag a finger and say 'I told you so,' to those who complain about Dodd-Frank and over-regulation of banks, in general.

Regulators fined the company a total of $185M last Thursday, while Moody's warned the episode would negatively affect the bank's debt. Wells paid another $5M to customers for creating more than 2M fake accounts.

Wells Fargo (WFC -0.7%) yesterday was fined $185M over its employees opening millions of fraudulent deposit and credit card accounts in order to meet sales targets and collect bonuses. The bank has fired 5.3K over improper practices.
Over at Rafferty, Dick Bove downgrades Warren Buffett's ([BRK.A]], BRK.B) favorite bank, calling it a "very big problem," that's caused "significant" damage to Wells' business model.
While "cross-selling" is something most lenders try to do, Wells Fargo has built its brand around this theme more than its peers. The charges, says Bove, reopens the question about whether customers can trust their banks and to whether another wave of regulation is needed.
Compass Point's Isaac Boltansky says the news is "bigger than WFC" and should be viewed as "clear, undeniable warnings" to the entire industry on cross-selling. The bit firmly between its teeth now, look for more enforcement actions from the CFPB.

The Fed stress tests are the centerpiece of post-crisis bank regulatory reform, and that the banks would even consider challenging a bureaucracy that's not in the habit of being challenged is a shocker. The WSJ, however, reports bank trade groups and industry advisers are debating just that, but say talks are still in an early stage.Fans of Dodd-Frank will naturally argue the stress tests have made the banks far safer, but at what expense to investors? A main area of contention is the opacity of the tests, says the report, as well as the ability of regulators to block returns for subjective reasons (such as challenging them?).Perhaps lenders are feeling their oats following MetLife's successful challenge of its SIFI designation.

 Citigroup (NYSE:C) has prevailed in an $800M court action filed by a billionaire accusing it of fraud tied to subprime and toxic mortgages. Arthur Williams -- founder of what would become Primerica Financial Services -- had sued the bank and two CEOs (Charles Prince and Vikram Pandit) because he says he had planned to sell his 17.6M shares in May 2007. When the bank assured investors it was in good shape, he says, he sold just 1M shares instead around the prevailing price of $51.59/share. Two years later he sold the rest of his stake at $3.09/share, and sued for the difference. An appeals court in Manhattan today upheld an October 2013 ruling and said the defendants weren't liable to entities overseen by Williams and his wife. A Citigroup spokeswoman says the bank is pleased with the decision, while Williams' lawyer says their team is considering appeal options. |Aug. 5, 2016, 2:56 PM|Report: Citigroup buys credit-default swap portfolio from Credit Suisse

Having covered bank stocks on and off since 1985, the team at Oppenheimer says portfolio managers have never been fans of the sector, but the hatred today is off the charts - even as the reasons for that hatred have gone away.
Banks used to be opaque, they overpaid for acquisitions, and often had frothy growth that almost invariably backfired. It's hard to say that today. While banks will always be somewhat opaque, today they're returning capital rather than blowing it on acquisitions, and their "growth initiatives are the epitome of financial probity."
Oppenheimer's six large bank composite has on average churned out quarterly pretax earnings of $31.4B per quarter since 2013 (including $30.5B in Q1 this year, and $33.4B in Q2). That's a lot of money, especially since most of it is being used to buy back stock at less than 10x earnings and below tangible book value.
While lower-for-longer interest rates will continue to hamper earnings, banks are managing appropriately for the current environment, and the math of buying back stock below book will eventually win the day.
Favorite picks are Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).

"Banks are figuring out that providing every product and every service to every client in every country was just wrong," says former Citigroup (NYSE:C) CEO Vikram Pandit, who used to tout his bank's "globality." Prior to the financial crisis, Citi had 268M customers, and today - after selling or shutting down retail operations across the globe, cutting its U.S. branch network by two-thirds, exiting subprime lending, student loans, and life insurance - has lost about 25% of its customers (along with more than 40% of its workforce).
"We're not close to being done," says Pandit.
Similar changes have taken place at HSBC, which actually had an even larger global footprint than Citigroup. For its part, the bank's been using six "filters" to determine whether it needs to exit certain locations or businesses. Among them are profitability, efficiency, and risk of financial crime.
So far, the cuts haven't manifested themselves in increased profitability. ROE at both lenders remains low (8% for C, 7% for HSBC; both were 16% pre-crisis). And it hasn't stifled calls to break up the big banks.

The Republican convention has left Wall Street banks on edge by embracing a proposal to reinstate Glass-Steagall, the banking separation rule which was dropped during the Clinton administration after a bipartisan effort to overturn it.
The repeal is often cited as a cause of the financial crisis in 2008, even though two of the institutions at the core of the crisis, Lehman and Bear Stearns, were unaffected by the act's prohibition of combining investment and commercial banks.

Helping the quick cut in Street forecasts over the past few weeks, was CEO Michael Corbat in early June saying he thought Q2 trading revenue would be up only slightly vs. Q1. It ended up rising 12%, though this was likely due to a late-month, post-Brexit flurry of action, rather than Corbat low-balling.

|Jul. 11, 2016, 3:40 PM|Banks and insurers cheap for a reason


While nearly all major U.S. banks cruised through the stress tests last month, writes David Schawel, those exams are about determining if lenders have enough capital to get through a crisis, not whether they can earn the sort of risk-adjusted returns of the past.
On this front (for insurers as well as banks), there's plenty more for investors to worry about, he says, thanks to the vanishing spread between short rates (what the companies pay on their liabilities), and long rates (what they earn on their assets).
A new Fed study finds the adverse effect of weaker net interest margins is materially larger when rates are low. The reason: The lower bound of funding costs is zero as institutions are reticent to charge negative rates.
Investors interested in buying banks or insurers because of seemingly cheap valuations might want to look again. Bank multiples, says Schawel, typically move alongside ROE, and serious improvement in ROE is unlikely with rates remaining low.

At issue appear to be lengthy wait times and trouble activating accounts for the new Costco Anywhere Visa Card from Citigroup (NYSE:C). The cards became available for use on Monday as Citi took over the Costco (NASDAQ:COST) portfolio from American Express (NYSE:AXP).
Costco's sales have slowed of late, with one reason possibly being "friction" from the credit-card switch, says Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research.
Citi says it's issued 11M cards and had received 1.5M customer calls by late Wednesday, but also says call volumes are returning to normal.
Analysts are excited about the potential for lower costs at Costco. Morgan Stanley's Simeon Gutman figures 25% of Costco sales were made with AmEx, which carried a fee of 0.6%, costing the company $180M per year. With Visa, fees should fall to 0.1-0.4%, saving $60M-$150M annually.

Given recent production outages, the firm sees a risk of an H2 pullback yet also a long-term recovery that is "the bigger and a higher conviction event in a low conviction world and we add risk, yet not go 'all-in' here." Stanley upgrades Concho Resources (CXO +0.1%) and Cenovus Energy (CVE +0.9%) to Overweight from Equal Weight, and says it also remains positive on Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD +0.6%), Devon Energy (DVN +2.4%), Continental Resources (CLR +1.7%) and Cimarex Energy (C -0.8%); the firm cuts Occidental Petroleum (OXY -0.3%) to Equal Weight from Overweight on relative value. |Jun. 9, 2016, 2:48 PM|Stress tests results coming this month


The Dodd Frank stress test (DFAST) results are due on June 23 and the Comprehensive Capital Analysis (CCAR) on June 29.
Noting a severely adverse scenario even more rigorous than in the past, Morningstar's Dan Werner says it will be hard to read anything negative into a bank's passing the test.
Barclay's Jason Goldberg points out Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) as two poised to thrive if the government were to allow them to draw down capital, but "when" is the big question as next year's tests are expected to be even harder. The two are trading at about 1x book and sport ROEs of roughly 10% - both gauges were about twice those amounts prior to the financial crisis.
JPMorgan's Kian Abouhossein expects Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and SunTrust (NYSE:STI) to have outsized increases in capital return this year, driven mostly by buybacks.
One wild card: This year's tests requires banks to model for negative interest rates.

The already-concentrated nature of the local banking industry means any mergers should immediately be deemed "complex," says a member of Brazil's antitrust office.
“I am really uncomfortable approving any transaction in the banking industry, especially one made by the nation’s four biggest banks," says Cristiane Alkmin Junqueira Schmidt.
Citigroup (NYSE:C) earlier this year put its retail-banking and credit card operations in Brazil on the block, and the nation's top four lenders, including Itau Unibanco (NYSE:ITUB), and Banco Bradesco (NYSE:BBD) would be natural buyers.
The antitrust agency yesterday approved Bradesco's purchase of HSBC's Brazilian operation, with the restriction that the bank refrain from additional purchases for 30 months. That deal also required more than the normal review.

"It's a machine, no doubt about it," says one getting disgruntled customer of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), which is one of only two U.S. companies which have produced at least $5B of net income in each of the last 14 quarters (Apple is the other).
Worrying analysts though is that customers like the one above - his family has nine Wells products - appear to have had their fill, writes Ben McLannahan in the FT. Wells' lauded cross-sell ratio has fallen from an average of 6.36 products per household in Dec. 2013 to 6.29 a the end of last year."
While the bank trades at a premium to U.S. peers in terms of multiple of net assets, that premium has shrunk to half the level of two years ago, and Wells recently cut some financial targets.
Without a big rise in interest rates, says Standard Life's Chris Haimendorf, "it is very difficult to see how things can get even better from here."
CEO John Stumpf - though acknowledging the low-rate issue - says there are plenty of avenues for growth. He notes peers like BofA (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C) closing branches or even pulling out of certain cities. Wells, on the other hand, is keeping its footprint, but adjusting its format with smaller "bodega branches."
Stumpf: “All of our new account acquisition happens at one of our branches. If you shut that down, at least today, you shut down your front engine."

In separate public comments today, Fed governors Daniel Tarullo and Jerome Powell said the Fed will require the eight largest U.S. banks to hold even more capital if they want to pass stress tests.
The goal, says Powell, is to make capital requirements so difficult that the largest lenders have to honestly assess whether it would be a better idea to break themselves up.
For now, the Fed is going to make 2015's capital surcharges permanent, which alone makes things tougher. "Really quite significant, probably the most significant additional potential capital requirement on the horizon." says former OCC Director John Dugan.

About half of all share sales by public companies this year have been block trades, writes Corrie Driebusch, versus an average of about one-third over the past five years, and just one-fifth over the past decade.
To review, a block trade involves a bank buying a large chunk of stock from a company or its P-E backers at a discount, in the hopes of unloading it piece-by-piece later that day at a markup.
The increase in block trades, of course, comes as business slows at any number of other bank profit centers, particularly fixed-income trading.
For the most part, block deals have mostly proved profitable this year, with an average one-day return of 0.5%, according to Dealogic. The leaders in U.S. block trades this year are Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), with Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C) also notable participants.

U.S. credit card balances are on track to climb over $1T this year, closing in on the all-time high of $1.02T set just before things fell completely apart in 2008.
Slow, but steady economic growth, an improving job market, and lenders returning to offering credit to millions of subprime consumers are behind the numbers.
Lenders will take it where they can get it, as credit cards are one of the few areas working for banks right now, thanks to low margins on ordinary lending and a secular decline in trading profits. For now, delinquency rates are low, and profits are set to rise even more alongside Fed rate hikes.
Capital One's (NYSE:COF) strategy to boost card usage by raising spending limits and giving out new cards is paying off: The bank's customers spent 20% more on cards in Q1 this year than last. For Citigroup (NYSE:C), average balances posted their first Y/Y increase since 2008. Balances grew at Discover (NYSE:DFS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) as well.
Even American Express (NYSE:AXP), whose customers typically pay it all off every month, is now focusing on lending to those who will keep a balance.

With sharp declines in fixed-income revenue looking less cyclical and more secular with each passing quarter, banks like Citigroup (NYSE:C), UBS, and Deutshce Bank (NYSE:DB) are among those trying to grow their equities business.
It sounds like a good idea, but with everyone diving into the same low-margin pool at the same time, that business is likely to come under pressure as well. The newcomers are also fighting against more established players like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS).
"If everyone tries to grow equities, the economics aren't going to be that great," says analyst Guy Moszkowski. "It's also not going to be easy."
Along with razor-thin margins, launching and growing an equities trading business takes a big up-front investment that could take years to bear fruit. Will investors already grappling with low ROEs stand for it?

He notes NIMs expanded - meaning banks held onto most of the benefit from the Fed's December rate hike. Cost-cutting programs are beginning to bear fruit, with 9% Y/Y cuts in compensation costs, and 3% declines in non-comp expenses.
As for energy, provisions made for a 9% drag on EPS, but reserves now stand at 6% of funded energy loans, or 11% of E&P oilfield service loans.
Ramsden is looking for robust loan and deposit growth for the rest of this year.
His favorite name is Bank of America with a $17 price target (vs. current $14.39). The stock trades at 10.5x 2016 earnings, but probably has the most sensitivity to higher rates, and the most core and non-core expense leverage.

The bank did return $1.5B of capital to shareholders in Q1, including the repurchase of 31M shares (vs. a float of nearly 3B shares). If the "living will" situation is any indicator - Citi was the only one of the large banks not to have its plan deemed unacceptable - Citi might have finally hit the sweet spot with its D.C. regulators and investors can look forward to an accepted CCAR plan this spring.

More notes from the call: CFO John Gerspach says while March and April have been better than January and February, trading business can't yet be called "robust." He expects trading revenues in Q2 to be flat from Q1.
The efficiency ratio went the wrong way - rising to 60% from 54% a year ago, as cost-cutting efforts were overpowered by revenue declines. Gerspach: “Obviously the performance metrics are not where we want them to be."
"The outlook is still ripe with risks," says CEO Mike Corbat.

The move, which could come as soon as this week, would raise the prospect of higher capital requirements or other regulatory sanctions for some of the institutions, and underscore fears that the firms remain "too big to fail" without a taxpayer bailout.

Returns are part of the mix too, and if they're poor at the mega-banks, this limits credit creation in the economy - a signal, says KBW, that companies must "radically restructure" to get their stock prices above at least tangible book value.
Looking at the stock prices of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C) during the past five years, KBW says Wells has traded above TBV throughout the time period - suggesting the bank is consistently creating returns above its cost of capital. Citi, on the other hand, has not traded above TBV for the whole period - "a clear market signal that the company should consider much more radical restructuring to create profitable business that can grow."

According to a LinkedIn analysis done for the WSJ, analysts and associates who exited investment banks in 2015 had stayed an average of 17 months vs. 26 months a decade ago. Going back another ten years, the average tenure was 30 months.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) are among the banks altering age-old traditions for young bankers - crazy-long hours of drudgery, slow advancement - to better suit the attitudes of this particular generation of worker bees.

The 10-year Treasury yield at 1.69% has returned back to levels not seen since the panicky action in mid-February. And while the Fed has marked down its expectation of rate hikes this year to just two, short-term interest rate markets haven't even priced in one.
This leaves those whose business model depends on riding the yield curve having to contend with not only a middling macro picture, but - once again - a rates lower for longer picture (although Jamie Dimon says his big fear is that markets aren't pricing in nearly enough in the way of higher rates).

"We are confident in the capital strength of the large and mid-cap banks - and with that, their capacity for increased capital returns," says Credit Suisse's Susan Roth Katzke.
Stronger balance sheets, she says, should outweigh what is a harsher adverse scenario from the Fed.
Roth and team see a total net capital return increase of 77% vs. 58% in 2015, with a median payout ratio of 31% vs. 27%. Incremental dollars should be skewed to buybacks given cheap stock valuations and the Fed's preference for the flexibility afforded by repurchases.
Best positioned for the highest capital return are Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Regions Financial (NYSE:RF), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB), PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC), and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB).
The highest incremental capital returns should come from Zions Bancorp (NASDAQ:ZION), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and M&T Bank (NYSE:MTB).
The lower end of payout ratios should fall on Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN) and Bank of America.

The reward terms for Citigroup's (C -0.3%) new Costco (COST +1.3%) card (coming in May and to be named Costco Anywhere) are considerably better than what American Express (AXP -0.7%) offered, including 4% cash back on up to $7K of gasoline purchases per year (AmEx offered 3% on up to $4K).
Citi's Costco card will also give 3% cash back on restaurant purchases vs. 2% from AmEx.

Calling Citi's Costco Anywhere card "significantly more appealing" than AmEx's offering, Credit Suisse expects the Citi/Costco partnership to "aggressively pursue increased Costco membership, dominate in-store spending, and generate significant spending outside the store."

Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) were able to clear their books of about $1.8B of debt backed by Blackstone's purchase of BioMed Realty Trust. There was strong demand for the offering, inline with what one might expect given the strong rally in risk assets over the past six weeks.
There's also a "flight-to-quality" thanks to Blackstone's track record as a borrower.
Wall Street banks funded a full $14B of real estate buyouts last year - that fast pace combined with the market troubles early this year led to serious congestion on their balance sheets, and the spread between CMBS and Treasurys jumped to nearly three percentage points earlier this year from about one-and-a-half a year ago.

Return on average common equity (ROACE) is what determines the valuation of large, mature banks, says RBC's Gerard Cassidy, and those banks that cannot earn their cost of equity capital - estimated at 9-10% through the cycle - ought to consider alternative strategies, including breaking up.
The key here is interest rates, and should they remain at these levels for a prolonged period, reaching targeted ROACE will be difficult for all banks, particularly for Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C).
While a sum-of-the-parts analysis indicates value could be unlocked, the cost of doing so could be prohibitive, says Cassidy.
Long-term investors planning on holding through the cycle are better off with Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), but active investors managing their portfolios more aggressively might consider BofA and Citi.

The moves, says KBW, would deliver an estimated market value of $198B, or 57% more than investors currently value Citigroup (C).

Of this, fixed-income revenue fell to $56.8M from $126M. Equity trading revenue fell to just $1.7M from $203.5M thanks to markdowns on two equity block trades.
Good times ahead: Not only have markets stabilized, says management, they've "aggressively snapped back" in the early part of Q2.

The banks, writes Lisa Abramowicz, want some of that business back.
The issue for banks are new regulatory and capital rules which make it harder to hold big inventories are paper investors want to trade. Meanwhile, the ease of moving in and out of vehicles like BlackRock's $25B IG bond fund (NYSEARCA:LQD) or its $16B junk-bond fund (NYSEARCA:HYG) have led to surging volumes, even as the individual securities underlying those ETFs are more difficult to trade.

These instruments are not only quickly traded without having to deal with the underlying securities, but are pegged to some of the same indexes as the biggest credit ETFs.

The global economy has been powered by credit for more than 40 years, says Bill Gross - noting official credit outstanding today of $58T is 58x that of 1970. That expansion, though, looks to be ending, as private sector savers are growing leery, and regulators build fences against fast creation. And don't forget the meager returns, with negative interest rates in 40% of Euroland, and out ten years on the curve in Japan.
The collapse in bank stocks globally isn't necessarily about energy losses. Price charts since 2007 for players like Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS), Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) suggest the sector's either a screaming cheap buy, or "a permanently damaged victim of writes-offs, tighter regulation, and significantly lower futures margins. I'll vote for the latter."
Then there's insurers, whose business models - which depend on 7-8% returns from risk assets - are at risk. They're not going bankrupt, but future profitability for companies like MetLife (NYSE:MET), Prudential (NYSE:PRU), and Hartford (NYSE:HIG) will be stifled as claims can't be covered as easily when investment returns are so lame.

It's another nasty session for banks today, writes David Reilly, and the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index is now lower by almost 20% YTD, with names like Citigroup (C -2.3%) and Bank of America (BAC -2.3%) down nearly 30%.
The nasty feedback cycle begins with the crash in the oil price, which stings banks thanks to worries of big losses on energy-lending, and more broadly hurts lenders by dragging down the stocks in general. This in turn, leads to concern about a recession would further ding bank profits.
More ominous, the yield curve is flattening. Using the spread between two-year and 10-year Treasury notes isn't a bad proxy for bank profits and it's slumped to just 0.96% today. Old-timers will remember when this spread used to turn negative - a sure sign of looming recession.
The good news, says Reilly, is that the energy crash and low rates don't look to cause the sorts of losses seen in 2008. Take the long view - the cycle will someday turn.

Holding its investor day today, JPMorgan said it was going to add another $500M to energy-related loan-loss reserves. This followed a $67M provision in Q4, which at the time brought total oil and gas loss reserves to $815M (vs. a portfolio with book value of $44B).
In addition, the bank said it could need to add another $1.5B to reserves should oil hang around $25 per barrel over the next 18 months. For perspective, prior to Q4, JPMorgan hadn't had to add to reserves for six years - in fact reserve releases were a big boost to profits across the industry.
"When the biggest bank increases reserves for potential oil losses it sets a tone for the industry,” says Mike Mayo.

As leaked yesterday, Citigroup (NYSE:C) will sell its retail operations in Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia, while holding onto its institutional businesses in those countries.
The retail businesses will thus be transferred to Citi Holdings from Citicorp, and their results reported as part of Citi Holdings beginning in Q1.
The businesses comprise retail banking and credit card operations whose assets are valued at about $6B, and Citi says their income wasn't material to overall bank earnings last year.

Citigroup (C -2%) operates in 25 cities in Argentina and 26 in Brazil.

Just at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), employees have taken $400M in paper losses on their restricted stock paid out as bonus last year, according to the WSJ.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), BofA (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) haven't yet reported 2015 stock grants, but their share prices have been similarly hit.
Should slumping stock prices persist, it could add to the leakage of talent from Wall Street to tech and other industries, as bankers will be leaving a lot less money on the table.
The issue is a test for new Dodd-Frank rules which forced banks to tailor incentive packages towards rewarding long-term health, rather than short-term profits. The result: Banks are now more likely to award restricted shares which don't vest for several years.

The team sees 120% upside by year-end for the battered (off 50% YTD) OneMain Financial (OMF +5.2%). Look past the subprime lender's high leverage, they say, and value the stock on a forward P/E basis.
Investors will grow to appreciate Ted Pick's efforts to shrink low-multiple businesses, says BMO, seeing 104% upside for Morgan Stanley (MS +2.7%). This is a re-rating story, and will thus take more time to play out than, for instance, OneMain.
Capital One (COF +3.2%), they say, is a fast-growing regional bank being valued as if it were still a specialty monoline credit card lender. "A re-rating is long overdue."
"Faster-than-expected growth in regulatory capital (from the synergistic combination of litigation normalization and utilization of deferred tax assets) should allow for significant growth in Citigroup's (C +4%) dividend and share repurchases."
Buy Synchrony Financial (SYF +2.8%) ahead of what should be the commencement of capital returns in in H2.
MasterCard (MA +1.5%) has seen marked underperformance relative to Visa of late - this despite an historical 85% correlation. In the medium-term, look for higher-than-expected buybacks, and in the long-term, faster market share growth than Visa and AmEx in China.

Lawmakers, he says, should break up the largest banks into "smaller, less connected, less important entities." Other options would be turning the large lenders into public utilities by forcing them to hold so much capital that they can't fail, or taxing leverage throughout the financial system.

 It is the European banks and contagion concerns that are freaking out the markets today - not just the Fed, China and crude oil - according to David Rosenberg, noting that some of the European banks are trading at 2008 crisis levels after the group has tumbled 18% YTD vs. 11% for the STOXX 600 index. European financial firms are taking a beating amid fears of "a chronic profitability crisis that makes it impossible for banks to build up barely-adequate capital bases," WSJ reports.
Deutsche Bank (DB -9.8%) is down another ~10%, bringing its YTD loss to nearly 40% while its valuation has fallen to ~30% of book value, and its credit default swaps spiked to their highest levels since 2012. News of major withdrawals out of Credit Suisse (CS -4.2%) caused its shares to sink 11% last week, hitting a 24-year low, and Santander (SAN -6.2%), BBVA (BBVA -5.4%), and UniCredit (OTCPK:UNCFF -5.5%) are down to lows seen during the last eurozone financial crisis. "Oil and the flatter yield curve alone do not explain the 12% plunge we have seen in S&P Financials so far this year," Rosenberg says, adding that BofA (BAC -6.1%), Citigroup (C -6.2%) and Wells Fargo (WFC -3.5%) all briefly touched 52-week lows last week - "an ominous signpost."

Citigroup (C -5.4%) beat headline estimates, but Oppenheimer's Chris Kotowski - a bull on the stock - says it's nearly impossible to figure out the "true" operating earnings thanks to a large number of one-time items, and the bank's weak job in providing detail.
We do know profit at Citi Holdings soared to $704M from $87M a year ago thanks to, among other things, the sale of OneMain Financial. Income at the Global Consumer Banking unit, however, fell 20%, and at the Institutional Clients Group by 18%.
His bottom line: “It strikes us that the general picture is that consumer banking revenues were somewhat weaker than expected, but importantly that all the credit metrics, both domestically and abroad, were stable at excellent levels.”
Nomura's Steven Chubak calls the results "disappointing," citing the above numbers at GCB and ICG. He expects the stock to continue to underperform.
Back out the sales of Citi Holdings assets, says RBC's Gerard Cassidy, and Q4 missed by plenty.

Key to the issues are the computer models the central bank uses to simulate how banks might perform during a recession. The results spewed out by these programs effectively determine the level of dividends and buybacks of the nation's large banks (not to mention the career path of bank managers).

Internal reviews found shortcomings in the Fed's system for double-checking the models - too few staff, too heavy reliance on certain key personnel, and lacking clear procedures and policies about certain aspects of the validation process. “Similar findings identified at institutions supervised by the Federal Reserve have typically been characterized as matters requiring immediate attention," according to the report.
In response, the Fed has done what most bureaucracies do - hired more staff and created a supervisory committee. Nevertheless, the findings of the reviews are likely to add fuel to calls from bankers and lawmakers for the central bank to open up the "black box" of its stress-testing models.

The green in this yield-starved sector is everywhere: Bank of America (BAC +3.5%), Citigroup (C +3.4%), U.S. Bancorp (USB +2.8%), Regions Financial (RF +3.7%), PNC Financial (PNC +2.4%), Capital One (COF +1.4%), Bank of New York  Mellon (BK +1.9%), E*Trade (ETFC +3.5%), Schwab (SCHW +5.1%), Interactive Brokers (IBKR +3.4%), MetLife (MET +3.2%), Prudential (PRU +3.6%).

With Carl Icahn's targeting of AIG, activists are clearly climbing higher on the financial-services food chain, writes David Reilly. The goal is to make the companies small enough to not be subject to the sorts of stringent D.C. regulations associated with being too-big-to-fail.
A case in point is CIT Group, which last week announced the departure of John Thain and a plan to sell certain units. Thain's goal had been just the opposite - to turn CIT into a TBTF.
The biggest of the big won't be quaking in their boots, says Reilly, noting the typical tools of the activist - boosting capital returns or levering up - would be dead on arrival in Washington. As much as investors would like to see Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) broken up in order to realize value - they haven't traded above book value in seven years - it's not going to happen this way.

Speaking to the media ahead of the investor call Citigroup (C +2%) CFO John Gerspach says trading activity is up early in Q4, but still running at muted levels - Markets and Securities services revenue fell 5% Y/Y in Q3, led by fixed income's 16% decline.
Despite a 25% decline in revenue at the investment banking unit, Gerspach says he feels good about Citi's M&A franchise. Advisory revenue fell 24%, debt underwriting dropped 17%, and equity underwriting tumbled 43%.
The revamp of the credit-card division is a long-term project, says Gerspach on the investor call, and will probably take up to two years. Q3 card revenue fell 9% Y/Y to $1.93B. Credit card loans fell 3% to $64.8B. Gerspach hopes those balances start to increase early next year.

The Street has priced in earnings declines for pretty much every sector, but Q3 and Q4 estimates for the financials have barely budged, and consensus sees Q3 results 10% above that of a year ago.
Morgan Stanley's Huw van Steenis, however, sees FICC revenue declines of 10-25% - far more than the 5% or so that's been talked about by bank managements at recent investor conferences - as the commodity price crash combines with collapsing fixed-income trading, and the lack of volatility in forex action.
With just $20B in FICC revenues, says van Steenis, Q3 is shaping up to be the second worst quarter for banks in the last two years. Leaving his own bank (NYSE:MS) out of the analysis, he sees FICC revenue declines of 17% at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), 9% at Goldman (NYSE:GS), and 6% at BofA (NYSE:BAC) and Citi (NYSE:C).
Bottom line: "On EPS, we are 4% below consensus on average across our coverage for 2015, and 5% below for 2016. The biggest delta is for Barclays (NYSE:BCS), BNP Paribas (OTCQX:BNPQY), and Goldman in 2015, and SocGen (OTCPK:SCGLY), HSBC, and BNP in 2016."

Merger-and-acquisition volume in 2016-17 should be $3.3T-$4.5T, says Guggenheim, up from its previous forecast of $2.7T-$4.5T. The current drivers of M&A are likely to remain in place; macroeconomic conditions may remain uneven; and several specific factors may compel consolidation in certain industries. Health care, media, and telecom activity has been robust, and should stay so. Activity in energy should increase, but banking M&A should stay subdued.
The winners? U.S. bulge bracket and boutique firms have gained market share at the expense of European and other non-U.S. companies. Showing the most market share gains is Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), followed by Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C). Goldman remains Guggenheim's Best Idea, and BofA and Ciit remain buys, partly thanks to the M&A thesis.

With Q2 results for the nation's largest banks now all in, Dick Bove says the key takeaway is operating earnings - which eliminates taxes, and the impact from loan losses and reserve releases - are not just growing, they're jumping. By his calculation, the operating earnings for BAC, C, JPM, and WFC are up 23% for the last twelve months compared to the previous period.
Asset quality is far better nowadays as well, he says, noting the new regulatory regime has forced lenders to hold a higher amount of government-guaranteed paper on their books. "The addition of capital, cash, and government-backed securities means that the book value of these companies is very real. Yet, at least two of the big banks sell at a discount to this value."
More bullish points: The most onerous and costly of the new regulations are already out there, litigation - while continuing - won't be nearly as expensive going forward, M&A is on the rise, and trading activity is coming back.
Most importantly, says Bove, is that investment psychology is shifting. "The attitude that banks are utilities that can never show earnings gains is disappearing. The view that bank asset values are overstated is gone or should be gone. The view that the government has multiple new ways to attack these companies is also disappearing."

The Street is underestimating MGIC Investment's (NYSE:MTG) earnings growth trajectory in a subnormalized loss environment.
Nasdaq OMX (NASDAQ:NDAQ) remains a top pick thanks to: 1) attractive valuation; 2) recurring and diversified revenue base; 3) strong free cash flow supporting capital returns.
Prologis (NYSE:PLD) has strong earnings growth and compelling valuation compared to net asset value.
Citigroup (NYSE:C) should outperform its big-cap peers thanks to: 1) Finally meaningful capital deployment after this year's CCAR; 2) increased focus on execution in core markets; 3) big footprint in faster-growing emerging markets; 4) utilization of the $48B DTA; 5) continued reduction in Citi Holdings.
Also making the list: Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) and SVB Financial (NASDAQ:SIVB).

"Asia will grow disproportionately to the rest of the world," says Jonathan Larsen - global head of retail banking for Citi (NYSE:C), and head of consumer banking for Asia Pacific - who aims to double to 1M the number of wealth-management clients in Asia in the next five years.
Current numbers: Citi's Asian consumer bank accounted for 21% of global consumer-banking revenue in Q1. Asia revenue from consumer banking of $7.5B was 51% of total Asia revenue in 2014.
Larsen will focus on those customers with investible assets between $100K and $1M, and total assets of $1M-$10M.
Of the competition from so-called robo advising, Larsen notes clients working across multiple currencies and investing in assets like real estate are going to need a wealth manager, not a robo adviser.

"Guilty" is the new "neither admitting nor denying the charges."

Barclays (NYSE:BCS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup (NYSE:C), RBS, and UBS are the five whose holding companies will plead guilty, according to the report.
While the guilty pleas are a nice feather in the caps of prosecutors, they seem to me more symbol than substance - too harsh a penalty would imperil banking operations, and behind the scenes, bank lawyers are working the phones with regulators to assure the felons won't be barred from certain businesses.

More than seven years after the global financial collapse, regulators and investors are still working through a mile-high pile of lawsuits and other civil actions, and it seems like the fines keep on coming.
Since the crisis, banks and other institutions have paid more than $150B in fines, settlements and other penalties, according to a tally by FT. That compares with the roughly $700B in profits generated by U.S. banks between 2007 and 2014.
So where have all the payments gone? The biggest have landed in the Justice Department, which has collected some $50B. Other heavy collectors include the FHFA, Fannie Mae, HUD and the SEC.

In the sort of things dreams are made of for retailers, Costco's (COST -1.7%) new deal with Visa (V -1.6%) and Citigroup (C -1.6%) will have the company paying next to nothing for transactions vs. the roughly 0.6% it pays current partner American Express (AXP -4.2%).
"The numbers didn't add up," said AmEx CEO Ken Chenault last month when telling his shareholders why the company let the Costco relationship go. "We couldn't accept their financial terms."
For Citigroup, it's plan is to make money by customers carrying loan balances, and for Visa it hopes to earn when customers use those cards at other retailers where fees are higher. Banks generally make about 80% of their credit card revenue from interest balances and other fees, with interchange making up the rest, according to Bernstein's Lisa Ellis.
To put some numbers on it, Costco had about $100B in sales last year, with its customers accounting for 20% of AmEx's loans and 8% of spending.

Bird has been with Citigroup (C +0.8%) for 17 years - most of it in Asia - and had been considered a leading contender for the consumer banking job.
Francisco Aristeguieta, head of the bank's Latin American operations, will relocate from Miami to Hong Kong to replace Bird, and Jane Fraser - who heads the bank's global mortgage unit along with U.S. consumer and commercial banking - will move to Miami to take over for Aristeguieta.

While the DOJ wants Citigroup's (NYSE:C) main banking subsidiary - Citibank - to plead guilty, reports Bloomberg, Citi has countered, offering that plea from a smaller unit.
An agreement could come as soon as next month, and is likely to include a fine of nearly $1B.
At issue for Citi: A guilty plea from Ciitbank might hinder its ability to operate certain types of businesses (Citibank accounted for 70% of Citigroup revenue in 2014). The DOJ, on the other hand, wants guilty pleas from important entities within banks, and one from Citibank would be a rather large scalp to hang on the wall at DOJ headquarters.

Looking for some kind of growth wherever they can find it, banks are about to get their wish as Fair Isaac is set to launch a new credit scoring metric which should expand by tens of millions the field of those eligible to get credit.
The new score will pull payment histories for things like utilities to calculate credit scores for consumers who might otherwise not have one. Other things - like how often someone changes address - will be used to help calculate a score.
FICO and 10 unnamed credit card issuers have been testing the new score since November, and Fair Isaac intends to roll things out nationwide by year-end. Right now, about 15M of the 53M previously unscorable Americans can be scored using the new system.

Citigroup (C -2.6%) last month disclosed CEO Michael Corbat's total pay of $13M for 2014, down from $14.5M the previous year. Behind the pay cut were the bank's failure to have its capital return plan approved by the Fed, and the fraud-related issues at Banamex, says the bank in its annual report.
2015 is looking better as Citi passed the CCAR with ease and Banamex fades further into the past.
From the CEO's letter: "Citi is not the bank that entered, endured, or emerged from the financial crisis ... It's a vast understatement to say that we merely 'rebuilt' our capital position since the crisis. In fact, our capital strength now far exceeds even pre-crisis levels."

"We've been pretty shy about dipping back into energy names," says a loan-portfolio manager at DoubleLine, summing up the industry attitude.
It's a sizable setback for Wall Street (not to mention energy companies whose financing has dried up), which has earned $31B in energy company-related fees over the last five years, according to Dealogic.

JPMorgan's (JPM +1%) $6.4B buyback was shy of Trone's $7B estimate, but the 10% dividend increase was better than forecast. The total capital return of $12.9B vs. his $13.2B forecast is a "marginal negative."

At this point for Citi, exiting non-core investments is of more import than wringing every last dollar out of them, nevertheless, some analysts say Citi's willingness to take a big loss on the Turkish lender signals more trouble for that stock market (NYSEARCA:TUR) - the globe's 2nd worst-performer in February.

The unit's ROA of 6.7% is about seven times better than the Citi as a whole, and while earnings of nearly $600M this year are only a fraction of the many billions the entire bank might earn, Citi could use all it can get.
Citi boss Michael Corbat, however, has plenty with which he can offset that hit, says Currie, noting a pretax gain of about $1B on the sale along with the opportunity to tap into the bank's roughly $50B DTA. There's also the freeing up of capital from the removal of OneMain's nearly $10B in assets. Assuming Citi holds 10% of that, Corbat can either reinvest $1B or ask the Fed to allow it to be returned to shareholders.

The Costco co-branding deal adds a third leg to the Citigroup (C +0.6%) story, says analyst Vivek Juneja, upgrading the stock to Overweight with price target boosted to $58 from $54.
One of his concerns with Citi, says Juneja, has been tepid growth and loss of market share in key businesses like U.S. credit cards, and the Costco deal should reverse this worry. The bank, he assumes, was likely able to win a very competitive bidding process because of its ability to utilize its DTAs.
He's not boosting his EPS estimates just yet because Citi has not announced an agreement for Costco's $14B in estimated receivables held by AmEx, but he expects one should follow a la the Best Buy deal in 2013.
Turning to the stress test and CCAR, Juneja expects Citigroup to be approved for capital returns this year. He also expects the bank to hit its operating efficiency targets in 2015.

In a deal that's been talked about since Sandy Weill ran Citigroup (NYSE:C), Springleaf Financial (NYSE:LEAF) has agreed to purchase Citi's OneMain Financial for $4.25B in cash. The transaction is expected to close in Q3.
Citi's consumer finance unit, OneMain has been reported under the Citi Holdings unit, of which the bank has feverishly trying to work its way down to as close to zero dollars in assets as possible. In a presentation yesterday, the bank noted assets at Citi Holdings have fallen to just 5% of total bank assets from 32% in 2008.
Citi will use the sale proceeds to pay down Citi Holdings debt, and the bank expects to see earnings boosted by about $1B thanks to the deal.
For Fortress Investment (NYSE:FIG)-backed Springleaf (Fortress purchased LEAF from AIG in 2010), it gets a natural fit in a complimentary consumer finance business

Presenting at the Raymond James conference, Citigroup (C +1.6%) CFO John Gerspach expects Q1 FICC revenue down in the mid-to-high single digits from a year earlier thanks to a slow start in spread products and a hit (reported at $150M) from the SNB's shock franc revaluation in January.

Webcast and presentation slides.
The presentation of Citi's transformation since the crisis is pretty interesting. The bank had $1.9T of assets balanced on just $23B of CET1 capital in 2008, and now has $1.8T of assets on a full $137B of CET1 capital. Citi Holdings assets of $619B or 32% of total assets in 2008 have been cut to $98B and just 5% of the total.
As for headcount, it's been cut to 323K from 241K, but it's a bull market for regulatory and compliance staff, where headcount has been boosted to 26K from 14K.

Citigroup (NYSE:C) executives are facing a critical hurdle this month, as they prepare for the institution's "stress test" results, FT reports quoting senior figures at the bank.
A year ago Citi became one of a handful of banks to have its capital plan rejected by the Fed, on the grounds that it had inadequate processes in place for assessing its capital needs in the event of a severe recession.
If the bank were to fail again, CEO Mike Corbat, CFO John Gerspach and Brian Leach, head of risk, would be under strong pressure from investors to step down.

OneMain Financial is Citigroup's (C +1.2%) consumer/subprime lending business, and Springleaf's natural fit perhaps allowed it to pay more than P-E firms who might otherwise have been buyers.

Citigroup (NYSE:C) CEO Mike Corbat's total pay for 2014 of $13.2M was 9% lower than the previous year. This year's compensation includes deferred stock valued at $3.51B, the same amount in performance-share units, a cash bonus of $4.68M, and a salary of $1.5M.
The scorecard: Citigroup's stock was the worst performer among the six largest U.S. banks in 2014, gaining 3.8%, the lender disclosed a $400M loan fraud at its Mexican unit, and the bank failed to win Fed approval for boosted capital returns.

2015 has opened much like 2014, with interest rates doing the exact opposite of what most expected, and falling sharply. It's a tough start for bank investors who have been counting on higher interest rates to help boost earnings for a number of years.
In the meantime, deposits keep rolling in, and the pace of lending growth isn't quick enough to absorb all the money. In 2014, loan balances rose 4.4%, but securities holdings popped 12%, and cash assets jumped 22%.
The good part of falling yields are unrealized gains on those security portfolios - negative a year ago, they're were in the green by about $15B on Dec. 31. More good news, says Goldman's Richard Ramsden: Valuations. The big banks are priced at about 9.9x estimated 2016 earnings, allowing for some nice upside if and when rates do decide to go higher.
Reporting Q4 results tomorrow are JPMorgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC -0.8%), and on Thursday are Bank of America (BAC -1.4%) and Citigroup  (C -0.9%).
|Jan. 13, 2015, 8:20 AM|Citigroup quietly scales back global consumer banking


The bank last year went from targeting 120 of the world's top150 cities to focusing its efforts on 100 cities where it has the greatest scale and potential. The result so far is the withdrawal from towns like Tokyo, Lima, Panama City, Dallas, and Houston. In the U.S. Citi (NYSE:C) is now focused on six cities vs. 14 previously.
The challenge: Shrink in locations where the bank lacks critical mass, while not losing the brand of having a global network.
Jonathan Larsen, who oversees Citi's overseas retail branch business: "We have to make sure that we are not subsidizing marginal operations for long periods."
|Jan. 12, 2015, 12:33 PM|Should Citigroup be split up?


Goldman made a bunch of headlines at the year's start by suggesting JPMorgan was worth more broken up, and now the WSJ's John Carney takes a look at a similar thesis for Citigroup (C -0.6%). To preview the answer: Citi is an even more attractive break-up candidate.
Carney first notes the market isn't exactly pining for a JPMorgan split - its shares trade north of book value, as opposed to Citi which has sold for below book since September 2008.
A Citi split could be among its four main businesses, suggests Carney: A global investment bank, a broker dealer focused on FICC trading, a global network of consumer banks, and a U.S. retail bank. Valuing each of these segments similar to smaller peers implies a total value of about $180B vs. today's $160B.
Yes, the bank could lose its $50B DTA, but the market may be valuing that at pretty close to zero anyway, says Carney, and the potential for regulatory relief might far outweigh that or any other hurdles.
|Jan. 12, 2015, 8:43 AM|Energy banking boom is over


The collapse in oil prices is set to crimp one of the few fast growth areas for banks since the financial crisis - lending to the energy industry. Right now, we're just talking about a slowdown in lending, but Charles Peabody - who saw the losses incurred by Texas banks during the 1980s energy slump - expects the current situation to lead to losses as well.
"It’s been a hot industry, probably a little too hot,” says Cullen/Frost (NYSE:CFR) CEO Dick Evans, whose bank has a sizable energy business. “But it is not time to panic. We have been in the game a long time. I am comfortable with what we have been doing.”
The flip side of energy issues might be stronger business for banks elsewhere as consumers find themselves with more money in their pockets after filling up.
Among the more sizable banks, Scotiabank (NYSE:BNS) leads the way with 34.6% of its investment banking revenue coming from energy companies. Next is RBC (NYSE:RY), with 20.2%, and then Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) with 14.9% and Citigroup (NYSE:C) with 11.8%. Others include Barclays (NYSE:BCS) with 10.7%, Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) with 8.1%, and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) with 7.4%.

|Dec. 31, 2014, 10:17 AM|Citi's "boring" strategy not exactly playing out


Citigroup (C -0.3%) CEO Mike Corbat had a 2014 New Year's resolution to make his bank boring, but instead Citi has pushed into commodities trading, kept a more aggressive prop desk than competitors, and expanded its derivatives business. Alongside, the bank has sold or planned to sell 19 "boring" consumer units across the globe.
“They are moving their chips from global consumer to capital markets,” says a GW law professor. "That's troubling because they’ve repeatedly gotten into enormous difficulties with these kinds of speculative trading operations.”
Corbat is walking a line between pleasing regulators who this spring will need to approve Citi's capital plans, and meeting his own performance targets. Missing those goals "is clearly a threat to management's tenure," says banking analyst Charles Peabody.
Scoreboard: Since Corbat took over as CEO, Citi is up 50% vs. a 49% gain for the KBW Bank Index. In 2014, Citi is higher by 5%, lagging the Index by 300 basis points.

Jefferies yesterday posted a 73% plunge in fixed-income trading revenue for the quarter ended Nov. 30, and a 45% fall in equity-trading revenue. “You’re going to see weaker trading results because of what I’d call bad volatility,” says Charles Peabody, as firms cut back on stock and bond offerings.
That Q4 trading revenue is going to be a weak one for the likes of JPM, C, BAC, GS, and MS shouldn't be a major surprise as Ciit's Mike Corbat, BofA's Brian Moynihan, and JPM's Marianne Lake said as much when presenting at a financial services conference earlier this month. But the weakness they described is nowhere near what was reported at Jefferies.
Alongside the weak trading results, Jefferies is also looking to get rid of Bache - its commodities-trading business. "The fact that they are throwing in the towel on this business just a few years in would suggest that maybe that opportunity is not nearly as robust as they thought it would be,” says UBS's Brennan Hawken.

 "My feeling is that if a bank has proper reserves and it’s trading well below tangible book value, that is an undervalued bank," Mohnish Pabrai tells Barron's, quickly summing up the investment case for two of his holdings, Bank of America (BAC -1.1%) and Citigroup (C -1.1%). "You could shut down a bank today and if the reserves are correct you would get back the tangible book value." Both are trading a lot closer to book (or even above) then they were when he first invested, but Pabrai considers them still undervalued and expects they'll eventually trade more inline with the higher P/B and P/E multiples of Wells Fargo and JPMorgan. Of his $700M AUM fund which has outperformed the S&P by about 150 basis points annually over the last decade, the Buffett disciple Pabrai keeps fees down thanks to low overhead - he's the sole analyst and portfolio manager. |Dec. 9, 2014, 10:17 AM|Citigroup taking nearly another $3B in legal charges

"We believe these legal charges should cover a significant portion of our outstanding legal matters based on current information."

A combination of new regulations and near-zero interest rates has some banks - including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup (NYSE:C), HSBC, Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) - privately telling larger clients to take their deposits elsewhere or face fees on accounts which have long been free.
“Ultimately my balances aren’t as profitable for the banks, and that’s going to impact my business,” says an executive with a title insurance company, complaining of sleepless nights amid negotiations with his bankers.
BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) has begun charging institutional clients money to park money in euros, and State Street (NYSE:STT) says itwill soon begin doing so.
Some bankers are advising large clients to break up large deposits across a number of lenders (including smaller banks not subject to the new regulations), and other corporations are going to find themselves needing to build more sophisticated (and riskier) portfolios likely including vehicles like short-term bond funds and uninsured money-market funds.

Once a debt is voided through bankruptcy, creditors must update credit reports showing that debt is cleared. Banks, however, routinely fail to do so, instead leaving notations of "past due" or "charged off."

"The exchanges (apparently ICE's NYSE and NDAQ) who have a hand in this and seek to benefit from the onerous version of a trade-at basically put the screws to us," says Michael Masone, legal counsel for equities at Citigroup (NYSE:C), speaking at a SIFMA-sponsored conference.
At issue is a SEC pilot program meant to boost trading in smaller-cap names. One of the provisions - the so-called "trade-at" rule - is a stealth attempt at hurting brokerages which run private trading systems (dark pools), said both JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Citi at the conference.
The one-year program - if approved (the SEC began seeking public comment this month) - would begin next year and widen the minimum tick at which bids and asks are quoted on exchanges to more than a penny. The plan would create four groups of companies with market caps of less than $5B. One segment would require quotes in increments of a nickel or more, and another will require both quotes and trades to be in five-cent steps. In a third group, trading will be discouraged in dark pools. A fourth group would trade normally.
Opposition has been pretty fierce - even within the SEC - but the agency for now has decided to move forward anyway.

Citi's move comes as the feds have upped pressure on lenders to provide credit scores to customers, and the CFPB sent a letter to the country's largest card issuers in February requesting they take this step.

Bank earnings models will no doubt need to be tweaked as the sure thing of higher rates becomes somewhat less sure, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield plunging all the way down to 2%, and 30-day Fed Funds futures - just weeks ago pricing in 100% chance of a rate hike by June 2015 - now sees no move until December 2015.

Manuel Medina-Mora, head of Citi's (NYSE:C) consumer banking unit and chairman of troubled Banamex, is preparing to leave in the coming months, reports the WSJ. A number of board members have pushed for Medina-Mora's exit in wake of the Banamex troubles, but - apparently up until now - he's had the support of CEO Michael Corbat and Chairman Michael O'Neill.
Alongside earnings yesterday, Citi announced the discovery of alleged improprieties at the Banamex personal-security unit - it's nonmaterial, said Corbat on the earnings call, but it is giving additional fuel to those pressing for Medina-Mora to step down.

Global growth, foreign-exchange, oil, and small caps are the subject of every client inquiry, says David Kostin. His team's recommendation: Buy "American exceptionalism."
In Kostin's view, U.S. economy and corporate fundamentals are still strong, with economic growth expected by Goldman economists to be 3.2% next year, the fastest expansion since 2005. Europe is expected to grow just 1%.
What his team likes are those stocks of companies which have a high proportion of domestic sales, plus sectors like Consumer Staples (XLP -0.1%) and Discretionary (XLY +0.7%) which stand to benefit from lower oil prices (plunging again today).
As for small caps (IWM +0.9%), Kostin is wary, noting downward earnings revisions have boosted small cap P/E ratios even as prices have declined.

Assets at Citi Holdings fell to $103B by the end of Q3, says Citigroup (C +2.3%) CFO John Gerspach on the earnings call. He notes that's just 5% of total Citigroup assets. In the meantime, lower legal expenses allowed Citi Holdings to post positive net income of $272M during Q3, and $224M YTD.
For perspective, Citicorp net income was $3.395B in Q3.
Webcast and slide presentation
Of the bank's plan to exit consumer operations in 11 overseas markets, Gerspach says sales processes are underway and they will be reported as part of Citi Holdings in 2015 Q1. The 11 units had revenue of $1.624B over the last twelve months vs. $37.78B for all of Global Consumer Banking, and net income of $34M vs. $6.785B for all of Global Consumer Banking.
Turning to expenses, the efficiency ratio in Global Consumer Banking of 56% in Q3 is roughly in line with what it's been over the past few Qs. The bank's goal is for 49-52% next year.
Net interest margin of 2.91% was actually 10 basis points higher in Q3 than a year ago (Wells Fargo and JPMorgan both saw declines as those lenders aggressively sought deposits). Net interest income of $11.3B rose from $10.7B one year ago.
Tangible book value per share of $57.53 is up from $54.52 a year ago. The current price of $51.10 is an 11.5% discount to TBV per share.

 The U.K.'s Financial Services Authority has accused six banks, including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and UBS (NYSE:UBS), of system and control failures in their forex operations, the FT reports. The allegations are part of the FSA's investigation into the possible manipulation of currency markets, which is one of a number of probes by authorities around the world. Last month, the U.K. regulator started settlement talks with the two banks, as well as with Barclays (NYSE:BCS), Citigroup (NYSE:C), HSBC (NYSE:HSBC) and RBS (NYSE:RBS). The discussions could lead to fines of £1.5B in total. By focusing on an inability to stop staff from engaging in misconduct rather than on actual manipulation, the FSA could help the banks limit the impact of lawsuits that have been filed in the U.S. over forex rigging. |Oct. 9, 2014, 10:04 AM|Morgan Stanley bankers set to reap rewards for jump in business

Springleaf Financial (LEAF -1.4%) has held discussions with bankers about financing a potential purchase of OneMain Financial, Citigroup's (C -0.7%) subprime consumer lender, reports the WSJ.
Perhaps trying to move things along, Citi two weeks ago let leak it was prepping to imminently file for an IPO of the unit. The Journal's sources say Springleaf's financing talks are at an early stage, and will probably speed up once those IPO papers are filed.
Citi has been trying to unload Springleaf for some time, but some investors - with subprime maybe about to make a comeback - wonder whether what seemed like a smart move one or two years ago is such a bright idea today. In a strict numbers sense, it may not be, but there's D.C. to think about, and Citi has enough regulatory issues on its plate without adding a subprime business to them.

Isn't this one of the ways we got into the housing mess? Citigroup (NYSE:C) signs on with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) to fund 15-year mortgages at below-market rates for borrowers with low incomes, spotty credit histories, or both.
The loans are being originated by the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America (NACA), a group - that has the ear of HUD - known for pushing banks to show they're fulfilling the terms required of them by the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (no redlining).
The moves also follow the banks' massive mortgage settlements, part of which were agreements to provide assistance to troubled mortgagees, though both say this new program is not related.
For its part, NACA says the foreclosure-loss rate on more than 18K purchase loans it has originated since 2006 is about 0%, with one of the reasons being NACA making up to three months of mortgage payments when borrowers run into trouble.

"Most of the reason that banks are underearning relative to their historical norms ... is economic and not regulatory," says Richard Pzena (NYSE:PZN), who remains bullish on the TBTFs. Low interest rates, weak trading, and "government persecution" are the three factors, and - should these normalize - earnings could nearly double at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C), though JPMorgan's (NYSE:JPM) boost would be more modest. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is another favorite.

Another cheap sector is energy, says Pzena, and based on relative valuation against the broader market - whether price-to-book or price-to-earnings - the major integrated oil companies are selling near all-time lows.
What the market is missing, says Pzena, is the nature of oil investment. The old days saw capital spending one year, and boosted volume the next.

Bank officials, trade groups and lawmakers are quietly pressing the Federal Reserve for a delay of up to seven years regarding the rule that limits their investments in private-equity and venture-capital funds
The "Volcker rule," part of the Dodd-Frank legislation, restricts banks' ownership stake in hedge funds and private equity funds, and prohibits banks from making speculative bets with their own money.
Regulators finalized the rule in December but agreed not to enforce it until 2015.

The Federal Reserve and the FDIC say the bankruptcy plans submitted by 11 of the largest banks make "unrealistic or inadequately supported" assumptions and "fail to make, or even to identify, the kinds of changes in firm structure and practices that would be necessary to enhance the prospects for" an orderly failure. Ouch!
Full feedback
The 11 dinged: BAC, BK, C, GS, JPM, MS, STT, and the U.S. units of BCS, CS, DB, and UBS.
To review: Dodd-Frank requires banks annually submit a "living will" detailing their operations and exposures and how they could be dismantled without the need of a bailout in the event they near failure. Pleasing the regulators is a must as they have the power to force tougher capital rules or restrictions on growth, or even mandate a breakup of the lenders. As for the current failures, the banks have about a year to address D.C.'s concerns.
"Despite the thousands of pages of material these firms submitted, the plans provide no credible or clear path through bankruptcy that doesn't require unrealistic assumptions and direct or indirect public support," says the FDIC's #2 official, Thomas Hoenig.

The big banks aren't quite ready to let go of their reserve releases: The big four - JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) - released a combined $2.25B of their bad-loan reserves in Q2, up nearly 20% from the $1.88B they released in Q1.
The banks continue to see improvement in their customers’ credit quality, but their earnings continue to rely in part on freeing up some of their rainy-day cushions, rather than being able to generate strong earnings from their operating businesses.
Even with the Q2 uptick, the banks are releasing less in the way of reserves than they have for most of the past four years, and analysts see the practice ending before too much longer.

 Citigroup (NYSE:C) +3.7% premarket as Q2 results solidly beat analyst expectations while investors show relief that the bank reached a settlement with the Justice Department over mortgage securities it sold in the run-up to the financial crisis. Citi took a Q2 pretax charge of $3.8B tied to the deal, which sent Q2 earnings falling 96% Y/Y to $181M but adjusted net income, which excludes the settlement charge, was $3.93B, or $1.24/share, vs. $3.89B, or $1.25/share a year earlier and analyst expectations of ~$1.05. The 12% drop in adjusted revenue from fixed income markets and the 15% fall in trading revenue were much better results than CFO John Gerspach had warned earlier. After stripping out the settlement charge, Q2 operating expenses fell ~3% from both the year-ago quarter and Q1 to $11.77B.
Mortgage originations fell 64% Y/Y but were 19% higher Q/Q, as the refinancing boom continues to wane amid higher interest rates; overall revenue in consumer banking, which includes mortgage banking, fell 3.5% Y/Y but rose 0.9% Q/Q to $9.38B.

The reported $7B settlement would amount to 7.7% of Citigroup's (C -0.3%) pre-crisis issuance vs. JPMorgan's 2% settlement - this despite the fact that losses on Citi's MBS book were inline with its peer group. Nevertheless, the team notes these press rumors have been somewhat on the mark and cut their Q2 EPS estimate by $0.70 to $0.40 to account for the $4B hard-dollar amount (the other $3B is for borrower relief).

Banks could lose up to $4.5B in annual revenue as new regulations alter how swaps are traded, according to a report from McKinsey & Co. That amount is equal to 35% of the $13B in revenue booked by banks from trading in rate derivatives, and it comes at a time when FICC business is already on the decline.
At issue are new rules requiring swaps trade on electronic systems rather than over the phone ("Thanks, big boy"), and the greater transparency should bite into profits. To counter this, says McKinsey's Roger Rudisuli, banks will have to cut costs and realign teams to focus attention on fewer customers.
The usual suspects make up the 5 largest U.S. swaps dealers: JPM, C, BAC, GS, and MS.

"I'll put my jacket on and walk out the door," Citigroup (C) CEO Michael Corbat has told Chairman Michael O'Neill should the bank flunk the Fed's stress test next year. In a WSJ "inside baseball" account of the failure and Citi's efforts since, Corbat is described as having turned his attention away from moving the business forward for instead a laser focus on proving to bureaucrats at the Fed that Citi's global business model is one that can survive the next crisis.
"Are you targeting our business model? Our strategy," asked Corbat point-blank to Fed officials in a person-to-person meeting shortly after the stress test failure. For Citi to continue to operate all over the world, replied the Fed group, the bank needed to significantly improve its ability to operate and assess risk.
Corbat returned from the meeting with an urgency to simplify operations and overhaul aspects of the bank's risk apparatus, and Citi has since sold its Greek consumer unit and put its Spanish one on the block. "The federal government's overreach is excessive over these big banks, particularly of Citi," says longtime investor William Smith of SAM Advisors, urging Corbat to instead push back against regulators.
Becoming more clear is that a stress test failure next year will mean not just Corbat's job, but also a likely break-up of the bank. "Two extremes, from agitated investors to tough-minded regulators, will unite to break up Citigroup as too big to manage," says Mike Mayo.

As recently as February, Citi was still in first place, but then the loan-fraud was discovered. The bank has slipped from first to sixth in dollar-denominated bonds by Mexican issuers as well.

Citigroup (C -0.9%) and a number of other large Western banks active in commodity financing deals in China are frantically trying to assess if they've fallen victim to suspected commodities fraud emanating from the giant Qingdao port, reports the NYT. At issue are whether loans the banks made actually have the collateral they're supposed to have at the port.
A typical deal in this murky world of finance: Copper (or another metal) is imported using a letter of credit, then warehoused in duty-free zones and pledged as collateral for cheap bank loans, the money from which is then used to speculate. After a few months, the importer either sells the copper or the speculation. Goldman estimates up to $160B has flowed into China since 2010 through these types of loans.
The investigation centers around one importer who may have pledged the same stocks of metals as collateral for multiple loans, amassing a debt of more than $160M.
Citigroup is focusing on loans to Mercuria Group, and late last month Mercuria informed Citi improprieties may have taken place at metals warehouses. Citi is already dealing with the fallout from the Mexican fraud, and this could raise further issues about controls at the bank.

Of the two reasons - a new regulatory regime putting the squeeze on bank business practices and the absence of volatility, one may go away, but the other isn't.
The new regime has banks cutting staff and restructuring units - especially from the likes of European players like Barclays (BCS +0.2%), Credit Suisse (CS +0.3%), and UBS (UBS -0.7%).
“What these companies have decided to do, some more dramatic more than others, is restructure their business,” says Cassidy. “You just have to manage your business differently by realigning your cost structure to the new level of revenues due to the changes form rules, regulations and laws."

Mexican authorities are asking why Citigroup's (C +0.4%) Mexican unit extended due dates and raised credit limits for Oceanografia more than a year before the fraud was discovered. "You could argue they were being flexible," says Jamie Gonzalez, head of Mexico's CNBV, which is conducting the probe. "What is surprising is that the controls weren't there."
In 2012, Citigroup extended the time between when it lent funds to Oceanografia and when Pemex repaid to 90 days from 20, and the next year it boosted to amount of financing available. "While the flow of resources was coming in, everybody was happy," says Gonzalez.
The bulk of the disputed $400M was lent within about 90 days before the fraud was discovered.

The way I see it, regulation is secular and low interest rates and volatility are cyclical, says Citigroup (C +0.3%) boss Michael Corbat in a wide-ranging Q&A at the Bernstein conference. Similar to Goldman's Gary Cohn's comments yesterday, Corbat says it's low volatility in markets, rates, and currencies that's helping to hold back trading activity, but it's only a matter of time before that changes.
Previously: Goldman's Cohn: "Abnormal" lack of action in markets

The next leg of the economic recovery, says Corbat, needs to come from corporations parting with some of their cash to spend on M&A and capex, and he sees signs of this beginning to happen.

Citigroup (C +0.6%) gives up much of the day's gain after CFO John Gerspach - taking questions after presenting at the Deutsche conference - says Q2 trading revenue could drop up to 25% Y/Y. This is well above the 20% figure JPMorgan talked about at the start of May which had the big banks shuddering for a couple of weeks.

Execution priorities are 1) Growing Citicorp while improving efficiency 2) Winding down Citi Holdings 3) Capital management and DTA utilization, says Citigroup (C +1.9%) CFO John Gerspach, presenting at the Deutsche Bank conference.

Presentation slides and webcast

For Citicorp, the efficiency ratio has dipped to 59% for the 12 months ending March 31 vs. 63% in 2011.
As for winding down Citi Holdings, a sale of OneMain Financial would mark a major step, and Gerspach says a recent $750M securitization of loans from the business marks big progress towards that goal.
The Q&A begins momentarily.

"The break-up of the universal banks is inevitable," says MKM Partner's David Trone, "not a question of 'if,' but 'when.'"

"We think today we are below our natural market share," says Citigroup (C +0.1%) chief of U.S. consumer and commercial banking, Jane Fraser, speaking at a Mortgage Banker's Association conference.
The bank's share of mortgage originations dipped to just 3.4% last year vs. 8.1% when then-CEO Charles Prince was "dancing" in 2007. Part of the plan to boost mortgages will be a renewed focus on buying them from correspondent lenders (hasn't BofA stopped this practice?).
Promising to be "extremely careful" with lending quality, Fraser also says, "Citi is no longer reacting to the crisis ... It’s a strategy agreed to with our senior management and our board, and they’re comfortable with it.”

The bank plans to double its commodities trade finance team within the next three years, according its global head of commodities Kris Van Broekhoven. A big player in trade finance - short-term lending guaranteeing payment on international shipments - Citigroup (C -0.3%) started building a commodity trade finance team in 2012, first in energy, then metals and minerals, and next up is agricultural commodities.The move comes as rivals like Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan exit the business of trading physical commodities. When these operations were part of investment banks, traders could rely on quick access to financing. "When they move, their funding changes, and they turn to the commodity trade finance banks to fund them, so that creates an expanded market for us," says Van Broekhoven.|May 14, 2014, 11:01 AM|Banamex scandal claims another 11 scalps at Citi


"We have unfortunately identified additional employees across business and functional lines whose actions or inactions failed to protect our company from this fraud," says Ciitgroup (C -0.7%) CEO Michael Corbat in an employee memo. The eleven fired include four managing directors, two of whom are business heads in Mexico. "The financial impact of this fraud has been significant ...  the impact to our credibility is harder to calculate. Arguably, it is more damaging than the financial costs."
In other Citi news, the bank is reportedly looking to boost its commodities business as many of the other big banks scale back. According to Reuters, Citi plans to begin trading physical Canadian crude oil. "There has been this negative attention but it seems there's still space to maneuver and to operate profitably, and to serve the needs of their clients," says Raymond James analyst Daniel Marchon.

Fortunately, this sort of thing never happens in the U.S.
At issue are possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act which bars U.S. companies from anything that could resemble a bribe to foreign officials.

|May 5, 2014, 6:59 AM|Big business win for Citi


Citigroup (C) grabs some business from JPMorgan (JPM) winning a contract to deliver custody and securities-lending services to Norway's mammoth sovereign wealth fund ($866B AUM). The mandate is "believed to be one of the largest of its kind in the industry," says Citi, which didn't provide any details on the contract, but it's believed to be "long term."
Citi is the custodian for about $12.8T in assets, and the win comes just months after it created a new unit combining custody with financing and fund services, and as JPMorgan continues to undergo management upheaval.
|May 3, 2014, 8:21 AM|Cyclical or secular? JPMorgan warns again on trading business


With Q1 results for the global banks just in the books, JPMorgan (JPM) becomes the first to warn on trading revenues in Q2, expecting markets revenue to slip 20% after declining 17% in Q1.
SEC Form 10-Q
As in the past, the biggest driver of the slide is weakness in fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) as investors continue to shy from exotic fixed-income vehicles contrived by bankers, and instead favor less profitable (for the bond desks) government and high-grade corporate bonds. There's also new regulations which have forced banks away from lucrative businesses like energy trading.
"I don't look at the $5 billion in markets revenue and cry in my soup," said CEO Jamie Dimon on Q1's earnings call (the bank did $5.37B in trading business in Q1), stressing his belief that the current tough time for trading is cyclical not secular.
JPMorgan fell 1.5% in after hours trading following the news last night. Morgan Stanley (MS) -0.5%, Goldman Sachs (GS) -0.1%, Bank of America (BAC) -0.7%, Citigroup (C) -0.4%: "Certainly J.P. Morgan's forecast does not bode well for the other big banks," says RBC's Gerard Cassidy.

In its 10-Q released today, Citigroup (C -0.1%) discloses the DOJ, the SEC, and Mexico's banking regulator are all looking into the bank's Mexican unit Banamex after it lost up to $400M due to fraud.
Breaking out some of the costs associated with the fraud, Citi says $113M of $165M of credit costs in Q1 is related to whether Mexican oil giant Pemex is obligated to pay the bank for some accounts receivable. Citi also says it has discovered "incidence of fraud" at another Pemex supplier, but didn't name the company.
In other news, Citi says it's ratcheted down its exposure to Russia to $9.4B from $10.3B amid the Ukraine tensions and Western sanctions.

 Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) are on a Fed list of 15 U.S. and foreign financial firms that "may pose elevated risks to U.S. financial stability" and so will receive extra supervision by a cross-disciplinary special unit called the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee. Other firms on the list include  JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), AIG (AIG), GE (GE), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), State Street (STT), Prudential Financial (PRU), Barclays (BCS), Credit Suisse (CS), Deutsche Bank (DB) and UBS (UBS). As a major clearing and custody bank, Bank of New York Mellon (BK), will also receive the extra attention. |Apr. 25, 2014, 8:30 PM|Citigroup up next for DOJ on mortgage settlement


JPMorgan cut a deal for $13B late last year, Bank of America is reportedly in talks for a settlement figure greater than that, and now the WSJ reports Citigroup (C) and the DOJ are ready to sit down to begin negotiating how many billions that bank will have to part with over MBS created during the housing bubble.
Citigroup was a smaller player in mortgages than JPMorgan or BofA, and its mortgage-related settlements have tended to be smaller as well. Bernstein analysts estimate Citi issued $91B of private-label MBS between 2004 and 2008 vs. $965B at Bank of America (and Countrywide) and $450B at JPMorgan (and Bear Stearns and Wamu). Trying to put a ballpark number on a settlement figure, Bernstein's thinking about $5B.

"They're impressive thinkers ... They just have to execute a little better. That was encouraging."
Mayo - who made news on Citi's earnings call last week by calling for heads to roll (specifically CFO John Gerspach) - reiterates his Buy rating and $58 one-year price target. Over four years, he thinks the stock's a double.
Among encouraging signs he took away from the execs performance: The restructuring story isn't over and divestitures are not out of the question, Starting mid-year, the bank will begin disclosing returns by business line - "Progress for shareholder rights." Mayo also notes Citi will begin webcasting its annual meeting next year, leaving Wells Fargo alone among the major banks not yet doing so.

There had been some rumblings over executive pay following the bank's CCAR failure, but it wasn't enough to derail the package. It was two years ago at this time that management had its pay deal tossed out by the bank's owners, and CEO Vikram Pandit was excused from his job a couple of months later.
|Apr. 21, 2014, 3:25 PM|Primary dealers stung by Treasury rally


Caught in the Treasury rally this month are Wall Street's primary dealers who amassed a $5.2B short position in government paper in March - the first net short position since September 2011 - amid the hawkish rumblings out of the Fed.
“We had that big selloff and the dealers got short then, and then we turned around and the Fed says, ‘Whoa, whoa, whoa: it’s lower for longer again,’” says fund manager Mark MacQueen. “The dealers are really worried here. You get really punished if you take a lot of risk.”
Dealers used to short Treasurys to hedge their holdings of other types of debt like corporate bonds and mortgages, but that changed after the crisis. Corporate debt inventories have been slashed 76% from the 2007 peak thanks to capital requirements (which essentially force them to hold little but Treasurys).
“During the crisis, the Fed went to great pains to save primary dealers,” says Christ Whalen. “Now, because of quantitative easing and other dynamics in the market, it’s not just treacherous, it’s almost a guaranteed loss.”
Among the dealers who have reported Q1 results so far, JPMorgan (JPM) saw a 21% drop in fixed-income business, Citigroup (C) 18%, and Credit Suisse (CS) 25%.

Mixed signals from the Fed were a major reason Citigroup (C) execs were so shocked the bank's capital plan was rejected by the central bank last month, reports the WSJ. The FRBNY reportedly told Citi it had more time to fix a series of shortcomings, but Fed officials in D.C. flunked the bank because it hadn't made enough progress.
The episode is the latest in a series of communications issues surrounding the now-annual D.C. assessment of the banking industry. RBC's Gerald Cassidy sums up the feeling among many on both the buy and sell-side: "Do you always need to have somebody fail to make the test look strong and rigorous?"

Wanting somebody's scalp, Mayo is unsatisfied with Corbat taking responsibility and likely a pay cut over CCAR. Corbat reminds he's asked Gene McQuade to delay his retirement as Citibank CEO to lead the capital approval resubmission process.
Earlier earnings and conference call coverage
In a quick note following Q1 results, Goldman's Richard Ramsden says core EPS of $1.54 beat his team's $1.36 estimate thanks to fee income in Institutional Services, and the news, combined with recent troubles for the stock makes for an obvious bounce today.

Cuts to continue in global consumer banking (pg. 11): Headcount of 158K at the end of 2012 is down to 149K today and expected to be less than 145K by this year's end. Branches stood at 4,008 at the end of 2012, 3,601 today, and are expected to be less than 3,525 at the end of 2014. Cards products totaling more than 800 in 2012, are down to 478 today and expected to fall to less than 440 at the end of the year. CFO John Gerspach says U.S. branches will be concentrated in major urban areas and a shift to online banking will be a focus.
Progress at Citi Holdings: Mortgages at $71B are down from $73B in Q4 and $86B one year ago. Loan loss reserves of $4.6B provide for 42 months of net credit loss coverage.
Disclosed today is another fraud discovery at a supplier to Mexican oil giant Pemex. The new fraud involves "similar issues" to the previous one when the bank had to cut Q4 net income by about $235M. "We have not adjusted our result for these additional credit costs.”

Finalizing the criteria on the eight largest banks' leverage ratios - a minimum 5% at the holding company level and 6% at the bank subsidiary level - U.S. regulators impose a far tougher standard than international norms of 3%.
The eight affected: BK, BAC, C, GS, JPM, MS, STT, WFC.
The regulators at work were the Fed, the FDIC, and the OCC, and the Fed's Dan Tarullo indicates he wants to go further, signaling the central bank may boost the risk-based capital surcharge to a higher level than the international standard. The most to lose in this scenario would be investment banks like Goldman and Morgan Stanley who don't have the deposit bases of their retail brethren.
Banks have until January 1, 2018 to comply with the new rule.

Prior to the rejection, Goldman had estimated Citi would be allowed to return just $15B - $10B less than it would need to in order to hit that 10% figure. WIth the Fed only approving Citi to maintain 2013's level of capital return, Goldman figures the bank's shortfall has risen to $17B.
The excess capital isn't going anywhere, reminds Mike Mayo, but with it on Citi's balance sheet, the bank probably can't hit that ROE forecast. He's lowered his to 9% from 10%.

"Mixed economic data, geopolitical volatility, and uncertainty surrounding Fed policy actions have weighed on capital markets revenues, with declines exceeding levels indicated by public proxies," says analyst Steven Chubak, cutting his estimates on the TBTFs ahead of Q1 earnings season.
"We anticipate the greatest cuts at the banks with heavier gearing to capital markets (e.g. GS), though none of the Universals are immune; we expect further downgrades across the group. 2014 consensus reflects a level of optimism not supported by recent company guidance or by trends evident in public proxies."
Goldman - whose price target is also cut by $5 to $163 - FY14 EPS is estimated at $14.62 vs. $14.95 previously. Bank of America (BAC) $0.97 vs. $1.22. Citigroup (C) $4.60 vs. $4.96. JPMorgan (JPM) $5.29 vs. $5.35. Morgan Stanley (MS) $2.23 to $2.29.

Absent reforms, another financial crisis is likely to leave taxpayers on the hook for hundreds of billions, warns the IMF, estimating the world's biggest banks receive up to $590B in implicit public subsidies because of their TBTF status.
Said subsidies include bankers who still have a "heads I win, tails you lose" attitude, and investors who lend at lower cost to banks than they might otherwise. The IMF calculated the size of the subsidies by comparing the CDS prices and credit ratings across larger and smaller banks. While the amount has fallen since the crisis, it still remains sizable. "All in all ... the expected probability that systemically important banks will be bailed out remains high in all regions."
Subsidies for the biggest players are "like insurance for which banks don't need to pay a premium," says senior IMF analyst Gaston Gelos.

Count Credit Suisse's Moshe Orenbuch as surprised about the Fed's denial of Citigroup's (C -0.5%) capital return plan. Maybe Citi is just too tough for regulators to get their arms around as it is the most complicated of all the bank holding companies.
Included in the Credit Suisse report is this handy chart of dividends, buybacks, and payout ratios for all of the CCAR banks for 2013 and 2014. Things are loosening up - the median payout ratio (includes dividends and buybacks) this year of 71% compares to 59% in 2013. The dividend payout ratio rises to 26% from 23%.
It helps to be smaller - among the TBTFs, Citi's payout ratio is just 8%, BofA (BAC) 37%, JPMorgan (JPM) 56%, Morgan Stanley (MS) 41%. Wells Fargo is above the median though, being allowed a payout of 79%.
The regionals (KRE), trust banks, and credit card companies - for the most part - were all allowed payout ratios above the median.
The strongest capital returns vs. CS's expectations are those for BNY Mellon (BK), Capital One (COF), KeyCorp (KEY), Huntington Bancshares (HBAN), PNC Financial, and Wells Fargo.

"Surprise would be an understatement," says one Citigroup (C -5.5%) executive when the top brass learned - 24 hours ahead of the markets - of the Fed rejecting the bank's capital return plan. Traveling on business in Korea, CEO Michael Corbat - who was on the conference call when the Fed relayed its decision - cut his trip short to get back to NYC for a board meeting. Following the meeting, he sat down with FRBNY boss Bill Dudley.
"It's too early ... why are you returning capital when you need it," is the message the Fed is trying to get across, according to a source, who adds the central bank looks like it wants Citi to continue selling off noncore operations.
Will heads roll? “Since becoming CEO, I have spoken with many of you about the need to hold ourselves accountable for what takes place at our firm," said Corbat in a staff memo today. "I am accountable for getting this right.”

It's a slow grind for bank capital returns (at least those subject to the CCAR), notes Goldman' Richard Ramsden, with payout ratios boosted just four percentage points to 62% this year. There are clear winners, he says: The credit card companies led by AXP and COF and the trust banks led by BK. Regional banks (KRE) boosted returns but generally fell short of expectations (with HBAN and PNC being the exceptions). Worst-performing were the TBTFs, though JPM and WFC were positives.
"CCAR highlighted the challenges large-caps have in returning excess capital," he says, with Citigroup's (C) failure a reminder the process is unpredictable. With all that excess capital remaining on the balance sheet, Ciit's 2015 goal of a 10% ROTCE appears unlikely to be met.
For Bank of America (BAC), it's resubmission - a better outcome than outright failure - reminds that even well-capitalized banks are "bound by stressed capital and could have trouble returning outsized capital."

It's a sluggish day for the TBTFs after yesterday's post-close stress test results. Satiated investors may be selling the news, or perhaps the lenders didn't pass with enough flying colors.
Credit Suisse's Moshe Orenbuch's team had estimated a Tier 1 common ratio under the severely adverse scenario of 8.6% for Bank of America (BAC -1.5%), but it came in at just 6% from the Fed - only 100 basis points higher than the minimum. Citigroup (C -0.1%) - estimated at 10% - came in at 7%, JPMorgan (JPM +0.4%) - estimated at 6.5% - came in at 6.3%.
Morgan Stanley (MS -0.5%), meanwhile, missed CS's estimate by a whopping 400 basis points, while Goldman missed by 170. "Not surprisingly, the capital markets sensitive banks appear on the lower end of the range given losses associated with a large counterparty default, in addition to higher trading losses vs. regional bank peers," says Orenbuch.
Jefferies' Ken Usdin says the lower numbers confirm the "teeth" of the stress tests. "Our initial take is that discrepancies were largely driven by higher charge-off and balance sheet growth assumptions used by the Fed."

Half a million doesn't buy much anymore.

He says they deserve to pay up for the lower borrowing costs they receive because of their perceived government backstop, a notion the banks dispute.
The proposal is part of larger tax reform expected to get serious discussion after the mid-term elections, and a Camp spokeswoman says the overall plan will make banks "some of the biggest winners."

Smaller bankers join in with their much larger brethren: "We're going to beat this like a rented mule," says Cam Fine, who heads the Independent Community Bankers Association. "This is a united effort."
Camp's tax would apply to financial firms with assets greater than $500B, levying a 0.035% tax on total assets each year. Among those affected (in addition to Goldman) are AIG, BAC, C, GE Capital, JPM MET, MS, PRU, and WFC. The largest could pay more than $2B per year under the plan.

He continues to have a Hold rating on the name with $55 price target
The move comes after CFO John Gerspach - speaking at an institutional investor conference on Monday  - said markets revenues this quarter were off by a high mid-teens percentage, investment banking revenue was tracking lower, and expenses headed higher.
Credit Suisse's Moshe Orenbuch cut his Q1 forecast to $1.21 from $1.41 and FY14 to $5 from $5.25. He still rates the stock an Outperform with $65 price target.

In the U.S., the  FBI and SEC are also looking at the case, which is connected to Mexican oil-services company Oceanografia allegedly filing almost $400M of fraudulent invoices for short-term credit from Citigroup. The apparent theft has caused Citigroup to lower its Q4 earnings by $235M. The bank could face questions from U.S. authorities about its controls and disclosures. It has already been rebuked over such issues in the past. |Feb. 28, 2014, 3:56 PM|Mexico takes over company involved in fraud against Citi


The government has taken control of Oceanografia after Citigroup (C -0.2%) discovered fraud on loans made to the oil-services company and requested an investigation. The supposed fraud began to unravel after Pemex found inconsistencies in how Oceanografia billed it. Shortly after, Mexico banned the Oceanografia from bidding on government contracts for 21 months, prompting Citigroup to review its dealings with the company.
“If this is not the first time Mexico is taking over such a private energy company this size, it would be one of the very few in history,” says former Deputy Energy Minister Mario Gabriel.
Earlier: Citi to lower Q4 earnings by $235M after discovering fraud.

Citigroup (C) will adjust downward its Q4 results by $235M as a result of a fraud discovered in its Mexican operations. Full year net income will now be $13.7B.
The shennanigans surrounds loans made to a Mexican oil services company (a key supplier to Pemex) through an accounts receivable financing program.
"While Citi's review of these matters is ongoing, Citi believes the fraud is isolated to this particular client."

OneMain Financial (formerly CitiFinancial) is housed in Citi Holdings - a crisis-era creation of Citigroup (C +0.3%) to house assets it wished to sell or wind down. Speaking recently at a conference, CFO John Gerspach said the business was profitable, but did not fit with the wealthier customers the bank is targeting.

Among the P-E firms sniffing around is Fortress Investment Group (FIG), a majority owner of another subprime finance player, Springleaf Holdings (LEAF +6.4%). Fortress picked up its stake in Springleaf from AIG amid the financial crisis. A combination of Springleaf and OneMain has been bandied about for years, and Hank Greenberg and Sandy Weill talked about a deal more than a decade ago when they respectively ran AIG and Citi.
The sale of OneMain presents a dilemma for Citi: One hand it continues to chip away at the assets in Ciit Holdings - $117B at year's end vs. a peak of more than $875B - but, the business is profitable and the bank needs the income stream to help take advantage of its $53B in DTAs. One option would be the sale of a minority stake.

In his first full year as CEO of Citigroup (C) Michael Corbat earned an estimated $14.1M, 23% more than he received in 2012. Of that amount, $1.5M was base salary and $3.78M was deferred stock.
Corbat's pay is roughly inline with the $14M received by BofA chief Brian Moynihan, but less than the $20M of JPM's Jamie Dimon.
Citigroup, of course - under a good deal of pressure from shareholders - overhauled its executive pay structure in 2013.

Expecting dividends to grow 49% on average for the banks subject to the Fed's stress tests (about the same as last year), Markit, says Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) will lead the way with 400% boosts. "They are the last of the major banks paying minimal dividends ... change is overdue."
While 400% is a big number, Citi and BofA will continue to lag their peers in terms of yield (400% growth on a penny just leads to a nickel).
Also expected to have a significant pop is Morgan Stanley (MS) - a doubling of the payout to $0.10 per share and a 1.4% yield. Others in the top 5 in increases are Zions Bancorp (ZION) with a 75% boost to $0.07 and Regions Financial (RF) up 67% to $0.05.
The others: KEY +27%, HBAN +20%, BK +20%, STI +20%, COF +17%, DFS +15%, AXP +13%, STT +12%, JPM +11%, CMA +11%, PNC +9%, USB +9%, GS +9%, FITB +8%, WFC +7%, NTRS +6%, and no soup for BBT and MTB where the dividends are expected to be flat at $0.23 and $0.70 per share, respectively.
As for ETFs, the dividend jumps are expected to have the biggest impact on the XLF which would see a 25% increase in payout: The ETF has 81 companies, but the top 5 holdings - BofA, Wells, JPM, Citi, USB - make up 41% of assets. In contrast, just two CCAR banks make up the top five holdings of the KBE and it should see a more muted increase of just 18%.

Under particular pressure this year because of its exposure to emerging markets, Citigroup (C) isn't shying away from boosting investment in Africa. "We're counting on Africa to be a major contributor," says EMEA chief Jim Cowles, boasting of "a new strategic plan for sub-Saharan Africa."
Citi isn't alone: Barclays last month said it plans to extend brokerage, trading, and other services available in South Africa to the rest of the continent, while UBS' wealth management division is targeting clients in oil-rich Nigeria and Angola.
Cowles' comments come as Citi CEO Corbat has recently said the bank should no longer be expected to be everything to everyone everywhere. Corbat, of course, was CEO for EMEA before being elevated to the top job at the bank.
|Feb. 14, 2014, 12:07 PM|Citi bet on emerging markets not paying off


The good news on Citigroup's (C -0.7%) exposure to weakening emerging markets might be that it's already reflected in the stock price - off 5% YTD vs. JPMorgan -1%, Wells Fargo +1.3%, and BofA +7.1%.
Over 40% of Citicorp revenue and earnings came from EM in 2013, says JPMorgan's Vivek Juneja, so expect declining revenues from slower EM trading activity, lower underwriting volumes, and weaker investment sale fees.
If the weakness persists, says Juneja, you can throw in boosted credit losses as creating a further hit. Loan loss reserves at Citicorp are at currently at a relatively low level of 2.29%.

There have been a number of suits against the global banks over claims of forex manipulation, but this latest by the City of Philadelphia Board of Pensions and Retirement is the first to include research highlighting unusual movements in major currencies.
Using data compiled by Fideres, the plaintiffs analyzed daily trading right around the 4 PM fix of currency prices ... curiously, anomalous price movements became rarer and less pronounced after the initial reports of rigging surfaced last summer.
Morgan Stanley has spent some time looking at euro/dollar spikes at 4 PM and also concluded they were unrelated to economic events. Instead of collusion though, Morgan pins the blame on computerized trading programs.
The seven banks sued by Philadelphia which is seeking damages as high as $10B: Barclays (BCS), Citigroup (C), Deutsche Bank (DB), HSBC, JPMorgan (JPM), RBS, and UBS.

"We believe bank stocks deserve to trade below tangible book if: 1) balance sheet risk threatens TBV; or 2) it can't earn its cost of capital. We think Citigroup (C +1.1%) will disprove these worries over the next 12 months," writes analyst Erica Najarian. "We believe the pullback in the stock has created an especially compelling entry point for investors."
The bank trades for 0.9x Dec. 31 tangible book value of $55.38, and at 8.4x consensus 2015 earnings - among the cheapest ratios for all U.S. bank stocks, and the only big-cap bank trading at less than tangible book.
At root of this is Citi's exposure to struggling emerging markets - last year 56% of bank revenue and 62% of adjusted net income came from outside of the States. Najarian's team ran brutal scenarios occurring all at once in Mexico, Hong Kong, Korea, and India - and came up with just a 7% hit to EPS, but continued growth in TBV.
There's also increased deployment of excess capital to look forward to - mainly share repurchases - thanks to the continued wind-down of (capital-intensive) Citi Holdings assets and the recapture of the DTA.

Citi ranked just 8th last year in the U.K. deal scene, and is 14th so far in 2014. This is in contrast to Europe overall, where the bank rose to 5th last year from 10th previously after brining in a number of rainmakers.

The regulations will not force banks to count 100% of their off-balance-sheet assets, such as much of their exposure to derivatives, and guarantees and letters of credit. That alterations will lower the need for banks to sell assets or raise capital to meet the Basel leverage-ratio requirements, which might be set at 3% or higher from 2018.

"BAC's current business mix, improving efficiency, and higher rate sensitivity should support ~15% mid-cycle returns (on required capital) by 2016. Legal costs should remain elevated, but analysis suggests BAC is only moderately under-reserved for remaining Private Label exposure. Long-term ROE potential of ~15% supports PT of $19, or 14% potential upside."

Barron's top 10 stock picks for 2014 shows an affinity for low P/E ratios, with 6 of the group sporting multiples of 10 or lower. The 2013 picks - which are up 35.2% on average, 900 bps ahead of the S&P 500 - had five names with single-digit P/Es. This year's list:
A depressed play on a depressed commodity, don't be surprised if Barrick Gold (ABX) gets the attention of an activist investor next year.
Up just 11% YTD, Canadian Natural Resources' (CNQ) free cash flow is set to quintuple to $5B in 2018 once the Horizon oil-sands facility expansion is completed.
A rising world population needs food. At less than 10x earnings, Deere (DE) is the kind of company Warren Buffett might like to buy if it became available. "Stranger things have happened," writes Andrew Bary.
Even after gaining 55% YTD, MetLife (MET) sells for less than 10x 2014 EPS and just above book value, but bigger gains are ahead once the company is given regulatory permission to buy back stock and boost its dividend. Met's also a good hedge against rising rates, as life insurers will benefit by having higher yields to invest in.
The rest: Citigroup (C), GM, Intel (INTC), Nestle (NSRGY, NSRGF), Simon Property (SPG), U.S. Airways (LCC).

BofA Merrill Lynch is a more cautious buyer of stocks after this year's gains, and its top 10 large-cap stocks to buy for 2014 are mostly under-owned and unloved on Wall Street: ADM, Caterpillar (CAT), CenturyLink (CTL), Citigroup (C), Cisco (CSCO), DaVita (DVA), Exxon (XOM), GM, NextEra Energy (NEE) and Nucor (NUE).
On CAT, the Lynch analysts point to high foreign sales prospects for 2014, and see strength in energy-related profits offsetting weakness in global mining; the firm has a $100 price target vs. ~$90 consensus.
XOM is considered inexpensive compared to many large-cap energy names, it is expected to continue its large share buyback program and should increase the dividend; Lynch's target is $110 vs. $96 consensus.
NUE is the ultimate contrarian play, as Wall Street is underwhelmed by steel stocks, but Lynch sees a rebound in commercial building as a big boost for 2014 earnings; the firm has a $60 target vs. $55 consensus.

Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) find themselves the subject of a lawsuit by the city of Los Angeles which claims lost tax revenue due to their alleged discriminatory mortgage lending practices.
Citi and Wells "engaged in a continuous pattern and practice of mortgage discrimination in Los Angeles since at least 2004 by imposing different terms or conditions on a discriminatory and legally prohibited basis," says L.A. city attorney Mike Feuer in the filing. "The misconduct has profound financial consequences for the cities in which mortgaged properties exist, and banks should be responsible for those financial consequences. Banks should reimburse such cities for lost tax revenues due to discriminatory lending."

The Too Big To Fail banks lead to the downside amid a report the set-to-be-voted on Volcker rule will not contain language allowing portfolio hedging - trades supposedly designed to protect against losses in a broad portfolio of assets.
Banks can thank JPMorgan's (JPM -1.7%) London Whale fiasco for this as the Whale's trades were ostensibly set up for this portfolio hedging, but ended up costing the bank $6B.
The move is a big blow to the banks which had sent their big lobbying guns in to try and prevent the disallowing of this practice. Banks often hedge to offset risks from trading with clients, but often there is no great hedge, and this is where portfolio hedging comes in ... or used to.
"Volcker has morphed a bit, thanks to the Whale," says UBS' Brennan Hawken. "Now a big component of it has become about hedging. What can you hedge, and what can't you? It's really unclear." The CFTC and SEC are each set to vote on the rule on Dec. 10.

While P/E expansion for the banks in 2014 is probable should economic growth pick up and rates remain low (on a relative basis), says O'Conner, "we worry about the potential combination of widening credit spreads and rising interest rates."

Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C -1.3%), and JPMorgan (JPM +0.5%) each failed at least 2 of 29 metrics used to gauge compliance with the national $25B mortgage settlement, according to a court filing from Joseph Smith, the watchdog overseeing the process. The last report - filed in June - cited JPM, Citi, and Wells Fargo for missing on 3 metrics.
The failures stem from the complexity of the banks' systems, says Smith, and fixes can be expensive, but all the banks have implemented plans to address to issues.
In one example, BofA failed on one test as to whether loans were actually delinquent at the time foreclosure was initiated, and another about how quickly it was notifying borrowers of missing documents in their loan modification applications.

Goldman cashes in its chips on its Conviction Buy call of Citigroup (C), downgrading 2 notches to Hold after a 27% move for the stock since being added to the list at the start of the year.
Other than the outsized capital returns, all of the other catalysts for owning the stock have been priced in, says analyst Richard Ramsden. "With the introduction of much more onerous capital rules for large-cap banks (LCR, Basel 3 CCAR, supplementary leverage ratio), we see risk that Citi's capital return story will be more muted in the near term than we had previously expected."

 As flagged, the EU Commission has fined international banks €1.71B for the manipulation of inter-bank interest rates, including. The banks fined are Citigroup (C) [€70M], Deutsche Bank (DB) [€726M], Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) [€391M], JPMorgan (JPM) [€79.9M] and Societe Generale (SCGLF) [€446M]. UBS (UBS), Barclays (BCS) and Citigroup helped expose the cartels and so received immunity for their violations. UBS avoided a fine of €2.5B and Barclays €690M, while Citigroup's was €55M lower as a result. The EU has opened proceedings against HSBC (HSBC) and Credit Agricole (CRARF), as well as against JPMorgan (JPM), for Euribor infractions. JPM's fine is for Tibor violations.

 The EU Commission will reportedly fine a group of leading multinational banks €1.7B for rigging inter-bank interest rates in what would be the largest antitrust penalty that the commission has ever levied. The banks to be fined include all the old favorites - Citigroup (C), Deutsche Bank (DB), Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), JPMorgan (JPM) and Barclays (BCS), as well as Societe Generale (SCGLF). The banks have admitted liability in return for a 10% reduction in their punishment.
However, HSBC (HSBC) and Credit Agricole (CRARF) are contesting the proposed sanctions from the EU and are set to be formally charged today. UBS (UBS), which paid $1.5B to U.S. and U.K. authorities for similar sins, is escaping a penalty, as it alerted the EU to the Libor and Tibor cases.

The CFTC sets a December 10 vote on the so-called Volcker rule which is supposed to ban banks from prop trading. It sounded so simple when politicians trumpeted it in 2010, but the reality of what banks do is slightly more complex and the text of the rule has mushroomed to 1K pages. GS, MS, JPM, BAC, and C, among others, will be eager to see what the regulations entail.
Any hopes for a watering-down of the rule likely ended with JPMorgan's $6B London Whale loss.
The SEC indicates it will act on the rule around the same time as the CFTC (3 other agencies must approve as well).

The nation's largest retail banks - WFC, BAC, C, and JPM - all expect to originate mortgages beginning in January falling outside of the standards mandated by Washington. To review, Dodd-Frank doesn't prohibit mortgages not meeting the definition of a so-called qualified mortgage (as defined by the CFPB), but banks can face greater legal liability on those loans.
The impact of the new rules has yet to be seen, but the worry is they would curtail lending at the exact time when it ought to be encouraged. At this point, the bank's lending outside of these standards looks like it will be mostly to affluent customers (jumbo mortgages), and not a large proportion of total activity. Wells estimates about 5% of its lending this year wouldn't fall within QM guidelines.
Wells' EVP of home mortgages Brad Blackwell: "It's clear the borrowers we're lending to today have an ability to repay ... We don't see a significant reason to contract our lending...because these are very high-quality borrowers."
Deutsche estimates 13% of jumbo loans made since 2010 wouldn't be "qualified" mortgages.

American Express (AXP +0.4%), Discover (DFS +0.3%), U.S. Bancorp (USB +0.2%), and Wells Fargo (WFC -0.1%) are best positioned to be allowed large capital returns (about 70%) after the Fed's early 2014 stress tests, says Credit Suisse's Moshe Orenbuch, while Ciitgroup (C +0.2%) and PNC Financial (PNC +0.9%) are likely to show the biggest improvement from last year.
Overall, his team expects large cap bank capital returns to be 65% next year vs. about 48% in 2013. The median dividend payout ratio is expected at 22%, level with this year.
Orenbuch notes the CCAR will be tougher this time around - notably by assuming a global, not just domestic meltdown, and assuming a significant reversal in the property market - with commercial real estate exposure particularly harshly judged.
Balanced against that and likely winning, however, are far stronger capital positions of the banks, says Orenbuch.

"Mortgage-related litigation has recently gotten a second wind and has expanded beyond investor claims,” says S&P, now estimating legal tab for U.S. banks could be another $56.5B-$104B. The good news is banks have gotten ahead of even these crazy numbers by boosting litigation reserves to nearly $155B.
The bad news would be if Bank of America's (BAC) $8.5B mortgage settlement with private parties gets tossed out by a federal judge (see Article 77 hearing coverage), the litigation losses could "escalate significantly ...  the ability of US banks with the largest exposures to withstand additional expenses is not unlimited.”

Not bound by Basel, specialty servicers like Nationstar (NSM), Walter Investment (WAC), and Ocwen (OCN, HLSS, ASPS, AAMC) are picking up these rights and making fortunes for their shareholders.|Oct. 24, 2013, 4:49 AM|DOJ probes nine leading banks over sale of mortgage debt

 The Department of Justice is reportedly investigating nine major banks over the sale of problematic mortgage bonds, although the probes are for civil infractions rather than criminal ones. The banks are Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Credit Suisse (CS), Deutsche Bank (DB), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), RBS (RBS), UBS (UBS) and Wells Fargo (WFC). The inquiries span U.S. attorney's offices from California to Massachusetts, and come as JPMorgan tries to reach a multi-billion dollar settlement over the issue. |Oct. 23, 2013, 3:36 PM|SL Green breathes easier as Citi close to renewing lease


SL Green (SLG) is about to ink one of the largest leases in years in NYC, reports the WSJ, as Citigroup (C) is close to renewing its lease and consolidating some offices at a large lower Manhattan office complex owned by the REIT. The deal is not yet sealed and if Citi doesn't renew, it would leave SL Green needing to fill the entire 2.6M square foot property.
The deal would be a nice get for SL Green at a time when the financial services industry is shrinking, and millions of square feet formerly occupied by Citi's big bank brethren are now on the market. Up until a few days ago, according to sources, Citi also had its eye on Silverstein's new construction at the WTC, but recently informed the group that it's out of the running.

Saying the move "would help enhance liquidity," Citigroup (C) - in a letter to the SEC - proposes a one-year pilot program testing the pricing of stocks in nickels or dimes instead of pennies.
The letter comes as those in the industry and regulators talk about adjusting tick sizes for less-frequently traded stocks, and Citi is one of Wall Street's largest market-making firms. Stocks only shifted from trading in "teenies" to pennies in 2001.
"In some cases, increasing the minimum quoting increment from a penny to a nickel makes sense; in other cases, increasing the increment to a dime (depending on average daily volume traded and stock price) or even a quarter (particularly for very high-prices securities) may be warranted."

As part of the global probe into possible currency-market manipulation, the CFTC has the major fx-dealing banks scouring their records in order to hand over any evidence of wrongdoing to the agency, reports the WSJ. Deutsche Bank (DB) and Citigroup (C) are among those so-ordered and Deutsche - according to an insider - is spending millions going through emails and chat sessions. Sources say neither lender has yet handed over any material to the CFTC.
Earlier this month, the chairman of Credit Suisse (CS) told a Swiss newspaper his bank was combing through records in connection with the investigation and had thus far found "no evidence of malpractice."
The key issue is the foreign-exchange fixes at 4 PM London time, off of which is based a wide range of other rates and securities pricing.
Any examination of banter among traders is sure to turn up a good deal of pejorative language and information-sharing among participants - none of which would be unusual or necessarily illegal. The investigation will turn on whether regulators feel such color crosses the line into inappropriate disclosure, says a source close to Citi's internal investigation.

The three firms - along with their clients, Lehman, Citigroup (C) and Morgan Stanley (MS) - put up $8.3B when they bought the Texas power utility for $48B in 2007. The rest was financed by debt.

Not surprising given negative feelings about the bond market, the utility sector garners the most votes (32%) for being the worst expected performer over the next year. Taking first place for the sector expected to perform best is - what else - tech.
WIth 91% of managers in agreement, Sears (SHLD) tops the list of most-hated stocks. Next at 87% is Tesla (TSLA). After that with 80% Is Herbalife (HLF), followed closely by ZIllow (Z) and Netflix (NFLX).

"Nobody's been more negative on C than me," says CLSA's Mike Mayo one year after Mike Corbat took over as CEO, and after yesterday's earnings report. "I can say that Citi is now more on the right long-term track than at anytime in the past decade."
Mayo spent much of his time on yesterday's earnings call (transcript) wondering where future operating leverage is going to come from. The bank has nearly hit its targeted savings level, he notes, but revenues came down even faster last quarter. Management urges patience, arguing to judge the program a year from now rather than on a quarter-to-quarter basis.

Assets at Citi Holdings are down to 6% of total Citigroup (C +0.4%) assets from 9% a year ago (presentation slide #15), says management on the earnings call (live on Seeking Alpha). Net credit losses of $635M fell from $1.8B a year ago, and the drag on bank income fell to just $102M from $670M a year ago. The amount of mortgages past due fell to $4.97B from $8.29B a year ago.
Turning to Citigroup, the higher interest rates didn't yet make an impact, with net interest margin slipping to 2.81% in Q3 from 2.85% in Q2, and 2.88% at the start of the year.
A focus of questioning early in the call is on the unexpected build in loan-loss reserves, and management says it's related to about $300M in exposure to three Mexican home builders amid two hurricanes that hit in September.
In a pre-call call with reporters, CFO John Gerspach says Citi no longer holds any Treasury paper coming due on October 31 or earlier, adding that his bank isn't the only lender dumping its short-term bills. "We're in uncharted waters."

 Analysts have cut their earnings estimates for the top five U.S. banks by over $1B in total, due to increasing fears about a sharp fall in trading revenue - especially from fixed-income operations - and higher legal costs.

Analysts have lowered their net income for Bank of America (BAC) by $128M, for Goldman Sachs (GS) by $123M, for Morgan Stanley (MS) by $97M, and for Citigroup (C) by $210M.

Any revisions lower are little more than "noise," and will be a blip on the screen a few months from now. Morgan Stanley gets just 15% of revenue from fixed-income trading - sluggishness in this area is no excuse not to own the stock, says Mayo."Revenues stink in the banking industry," he allows, and that's why he likes Morgan Stanley (and Citigroup C as well) - "the restructuring story can cut through the revenue weakness."What about Bank of America (BAC) which has moved nearly tick for tick with Morgan Stanley this year?

Also started at Buy is Citigroup (C -0.6%) as rising home prices could boost Citi Holdings - the unit into which the bank's legacy assets have been placed. Better earnings should also allow the recapture of Citi's $45B deferred tax asset. He sees 2015 adjusted EPS of $6.31 vs. $4.93 this year.

Back in China, Chanos says the country's credit system has "gone crazy" - new debt is growing at 30-40% of GDP per year vs. about 10% nominal GDP growth (and Chanos doesn't buy the GDP numbers).

Worst-case estimates of legal losses stemming from pre-crisis mortgage sales at the three largest U.S. banks "are clearly manageable," says Drexel Hamilton's David Hilder. His conclusion comes after studying "reasonably possible losses" in the Q2 filings of BAC, C, JPM, and WFC.
"Initial estimates of mortgage-related losses and litigation settlement costs were too low ... at this point, more than 5 years since the mortgage-driven parts of the crisis began to explode ... we believe the banks' estimates ... are likely to be more accurate than externally-derived estimates."

Maybe a victory for prospective homeowners, but certainly a victory for anyone dependent upon a speedy housing market, the new proposal for the Qualified Residential Mortgage rule (QRM) is quite a bit less-restrictive than the original version.
The new standard would allow a no downpayment option similar to that allowed by the CFPB - that rule protects banks from being sued by mortgage investors on zero-down loans as long as the borrower's debt to income ratio is less than 43%.
The new plan also requires banks to hold onto a slice of mortgages (for those with less than 20% down) when debt/income is above 43% as opposed to 36% in the initial proposal.
The agencies will await public comment before a vote on the final rule.

0% balance transfers are nothing new, but today's teasers come with unusually lengthy periods - up to 2 years - and are being offered to a wider swath of customers than in the past, say industry executives (anyone who lived through the last credit cycle will find that hard to believe).
Naturally, it comes with a catch, and lenders make money by charging a one-time transfer fee - typically 3%. Kudos to the credit card operators for slipping "0%" by regulators, while charging 3%.
While JPMorgan (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Discover (DFS) are among those aggressively going after the business, American Express (AXP) CEO Ken Chenault isn't a fan. "Putting out a substantial number of 0% offers doesn't appear to target the affluent prospects some competitors claim to be after, nor is it a net revenue driver over the short term," he told investors earlier this month.
The others claim the practice allows them to grow their loan portfolios after they shrank dramatically in wake of the financial crisis.

"Rates businesses could have lower revenues over the next few years as European sovereign opportunities recede," says Citigroup (C) global head of rates Andrew Morton.
Revenues in rates trading at investment banks fell 36% in H1, according to research group Coalition. It's a big move in a segment which has become the banks' most lucrative since the financial crisis and makes up 20% of overall revenue, according to Boston Consulting Group.
"We expect revenues and headcount productivity to sharply decline as the business moves to more efficient trading venues," says Deutsch's Matt Spick. Those with the biggest market share like Citigroup, Barclays (BCS), and Deutsche (DB) should cope better than smaller rivals like Credit Suisse (CS), which has already cut capital allocated to the business and has announced more cuts are on the way.

A bill exempting broad swathes of trades from new regulation - which cruised through the House Financial Services Committee this month - was essentially written by Citigroup (C), according to emails reviewed by the NYT. Is this even news? Fans of The Aviator have seen it before.         |May 22, 2013, 11:07 AM|AIG remains at the top Goldman's list of hedge fund hotels (the 50 stocks appearing most frequently among hedge fund top 10 holdings). Google (GOOG) retains its #2 position. Apple (APPL) - in the top spot for 3 years until February - remains at #3. Goldman notes the basket has outperformed the S&P a bit this year and the top 20 has done better by more than 1000 basis points. We smell an ETF offering. The rest of the top 20: C, GM, PCLN, VMED, NWSA, MSFT, HTZ, JPM, APC, PFE, QCOM, CHTR, HES, CBS, EBAY, DAL, EQIX.         |May 21, 2013, 12:24 PM|Low rates and sluggish loan growth will continue to pressure profits of the big banks in 2013, writes Credit Suisse. At the top of the list of those best-positioned to grow revenue, manage expenses, and deploy capital: Citigroup (C), JPMorgan (JPM), and U.S. Bancorp (USB). JPMorgan has already tipped that trading results are looking good in Q2. Look to upcoming investor conferences for more pre-earnings clues.|May 21, 2013, 11:06 AM|Citigroup (C) looks to enhance its Latin American commercial card business, launching its Global Issuing platform for that region. Puerto Rico will be the first to adopt the new technology, making Citi the first local issuer with a chip card solution for that market. Further countries will soon roll it out. (PR)|May 18, 2013, 9:15 AM|Leon Cooperman and partner Steve Einhorn keep it simple: Stocks (VTI) are cheap relative to interest rates and inflation. The guy who bought T-bills (SHY) has migrated to T-bonds (TLT), the guy who bought T-bonds has moved to investment grade corporates (LQD), the guy who bought IG is now in high-yield (HYG, JNK), and so on (glasses clink in the FOMC board room). Their largest position is Sprint Nextel (S) - as fans of Masayoshi Son and long-time owners of DISH, the duo like seeing two industry titans both wanting the same asset. New Citigroup (C) management should be able to double ROE over the next 2-3 years, and Transocean (RIG) sells for a significant discount to asset value.|May 17, 2013, 2:59 PM|Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citigroup (C) have halted the vast majority of foreclosure sales in numerous states following the release of new standards from the OCC, reports the American Banker. Harkening back to the days of the robo-signing scandal, Wells' foreclosure sales across 5 westerns states dropped to fewer than 10 per day in April from more than 300 previously. JPMorgan (JPM) also slowed sales, but has returned to normal activity. BofA (BAC) is proceeding as usual.|May 16, 2013, 3:55 PM|Described as a win for Wall Street's biggest swaps dealers - JPM, BAC, C, MS, and GS - the CFTC approves new swap trading rules 3 years after the passage of Dodd-Frank. The rules mandate new trading platforms making bids and offers public, but require traders send request for bids to just two firms before execution rather than the five some had called for. Smaller exchanges aren't sweating it, instead happy they now have a defined system to operate under.|May 16, 2013, 7:27 AM|Citigroup (C) joins AIG in the hedge fund hotel (Apple was kicked out in late 2012/early 2013), with this week's 13F filings showing a number of well-known funds adding or initiating positions in Q1 (though Tepper's Appaloosa pared his). The stock's up 40% since Michael Corbat took the reins from Vikram Pandit and hit another 52-week high yesterday.         |May 15, 2013, 7:21 AM|Citigroup (C) agrees to sell its Brazilian credit card and consumer finance business to Itau Unibanco (ITUB) for $1.37B, subject to regulatory approval. The transaction is expected to generate an after-tax gain-on-sale of about $300M ($0.10/share).|May 14, 2013, 8:22 AM|More Tepper: Turning to individual ideas, he says Citigroup (C) has become one of his biggest positions. On Apple (AAPL): If the company doesn't have something "revolutionary" coming, it better do something "evolutionary" - bigger screen, cheap iPhone. If we don't see anything by September, then it's "Houston we got a problem," and Tepper hopes he's quicker on the sell button than everybody else.|May 9, 2013, 3:18 PM|U.K. mobile banking specialist Monitise PLC (MONIF.PK +9.1%) pops as Lee Cooperman - presenting at SALT in Las Vegas - calls it his top conviction pick: "no financial risk .. no debt ... the blessing of Visa." He owns more than 10% of the company. Other top picks: ESRX, QCOM, C, AIG, MET, and RIG.|May 9, 2013, 6:11 AM|Citigroup (C) gains on Deutsche Bank (DB) in the race for currency trading supremacy. C (which came in second in a Euromoney Institutional Investor poll), cut DB's market share lead to just 0.28%, which is about as tight as the race for the top spot has ever been. C's ascent is partially attributable to its strong showing in emerging-market foreign exchange, where it leads DB by more than 2 percentage points.|May 7, 2013, 11:48 AM|Citigroup (C) sues Barclays (BCS) to recover nearly $142M related to foreign exchange trading amidst the Lehman bankruptcy. Citi claims Barclays promised to indemnify Citi against any losses from settling trades for Lehman between Sept. 17-19, 2008. Citi says it lost $580M during this period, but has reduced the amount (plus legal fees) to $141.8M.|May 6, 2013, 9:09 AM|Bacon Bradesco (BBD) drops out of the bidding for Citigroup's (C) Brazilian consumer finance unit, according to a local newspaper, after getting no reply on its $1.49B offer. With Banco Santander (SAN) not yet indicating any interest, it could leave just Itau Unibanco (ITUB) as the lone potential buyer.         |Apr. 30, 2013, 9:52 AM|More on Case-Shiller: Home prices increased 9.3% Y/Y for the 20-city composite, the fastest gain in 7 years. Phoenix (+23%), San Francisco, Las Vegas, and Atlanta saw the biggest increases, while NYC, Boston, and Chicago had the smallest. Nationally, prices are back at autumn 2003 levels and about 30% below their summer 2006 peaks. Maybe more levered than any other large bank to home price recovery, Citigroup (C) is flat. (full report)|Apr. 29, 2013, 10:26 AM|Citigroup's (C) reluctance to pare its mortgage assets at fire-sale prices could pay off, says KBW, as it now stands to greatly benefit from rising home prices. It's a flow vs. stock argument as Citi - compared to WFC, JPM, or USB - does a relatively small amount of (now under profit-pressure) mortgage origination volume, but still has loads of questionable paper on its books. Also positioned to benefit is BAC.|Apr. 25, 2013, 7:25 PM|Citigroup Inc. (C) declares $0.01/share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. Forward yield 0.08%. For shareholders of record May 06. Payable May 24. Ex-div date May 02.

That's roughly 25M shares vs. a 3B share float. The announcement was made in conjunction with the declaration of the $0.01 quarterly dividend.

A purchase would turn Itau into Uruguay's 2nd largest bank after Santander.         |Apr. 25, 2013, 8:22 AM|Citigroup (C) beefs up its commodities operations, hiring Rick McIntire (previously of UBS) as global head of base metals sales, and Dylan Morgan (also UBS) as co-head of base metals trading. The bank also makes a number of hires (all from Deutsche) for its Houston energy team. (PR)|Apr. 24, 2013, 3:58 PM|Richard Pzena (PZN) - still heavily overweight financials (XLF) and mature tech (XLK) - makes his case for global banks in today's earnings call (transcript): With capital levels of 11-13% at JPM, C, and BCS double what they were pre-crisis, will regulators allow banks to earn a decent return on said capital? A definite "yes," says Pzena, seeing no reason demand for financial products won't continue to grow faster than GDP, and noting bank managers' "laser-like focus" on improving returns. An average price-to-book ratio of 0.7x combined with a modest ROE of 12-13% suggests fair value more than double current prices.|Apr. 24, 2013, 12:04 PM|"The Mike and Mike show is off to a great start," says CLSA's Mike Mayo (not one of the Mikes), sounding very much like a fan, not critic, of Citigroup (C +1.8%). Speaking outside the bank's annual meeting, Mayo says the shareholders in attendance - still smarting over losses from the financial crisis - couldn't care less about the bank's recent progress. Preferring to focus on today, Mayo notes the ROE last quarter was an impressive 14% once tax credits are stripped out.|Apr. 23, 2013, 10:44 AM|Maybe marking a new shareholder-friendly attitude, Citigroup (C) reaches out to Mike Mayo, offering the oft-critical analyst a one-on-one with CEO Mike Corbat just ahead of the annual shareholder meeting (Mayo passed due to an earlier appointment). "It's gone from cold war to detente to engagement," says Mayo who has a Buy rating on the stock and purchased shares so he could attend the shareholder meeting.         |Apr. 17, 2013, 1:38 PM|"Too little has been changed to avoid a repeat of the problem," says the Boston Fed's Eric Rosengren, arguing banks with broker-dealer units continue to hold too little capital. "The status quo represents an ongoing financial stability risk." The largest ones still standing are MS, UBS, GS, C, DB, CS, BAC, BCS, and JPM, and each of the U.S. ones passed the Fed stress test and are returning capital.|Apr. 16, 2013, 3:20 PM|Citigroup (C) shareholders (and Mike Corbat) might want to say a thank you to departed CEO Vikram Pandit and his team as a number of costly hires of rainmakers nearly 3 years ago is paying big dividends now.

Banks would need 12 years of earnings to build this amount organically, though the bill would give just 5 - say goodbye to lending. Break up the banks? BAC, C, JPM, and WFC all have multiple divisions with more than $400M in assets - the level at which the bill gets tough on lenders.         |Apr. 15, 2013, 11:17 AM|Reducing the drag on earnings from Citi Holdings remains a key focus, says Citigroup (C +2.5%) CEO Mike Corbat on the earnings call, noting the unit's toxic assets were cut 29% Y/Y to $149B (presentation slides). Citi Holdings posted a loss of $788M in Q1 vs. $1.1B a year ago (Citicorp net income was $4.8B in Q1). Legal costs alone at Citi Holdings were $644M in Q1 vs. just $66M for the rest of the bank.
