European Commissioner for Competition claims U.S. Senate hearing sparked Apple tax inspection



Margrethe Vestager in reference to a 2013 U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearing : "Because the U.S. Senate cares as much as we do about making sure companies pay their fair share of tax. And it was their investigation into Apple -- and U.S. transparency rules -- that tipped us off that the company might have received state aid.”
The European Commission opened an investigation into Apple's (AAPL -0.5%) Irish tax arrangements a year after the Senate inquiry.
Apple plans to aggressively challenge the $14.B retroactive tax ruling with Ireland now squarely in its corner.
