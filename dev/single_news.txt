FDA updates nutrition labeling on packaged foods

The FDA has updated and modernized the Nutrition Facts labeling on packaged foods and beverages with the aim of better informing consumers about food choices that support a healthy diet.Key changes:Serving size and number of servings per container are more prominently displayed. Serving size updated to reflect what people actually eat and drink (as compared to the mouse-sized portions previously listed).The daily values for nutrients updated based on new scientific evidence. The daily values reflect amounts to consume or not to exceed. Data for %Daily Value make it easier for consumers to determine how much a nutrient in a serving contributes to a daily diet.Added sugars are now required on the label. Vitamin D and potassium are also required because many consumers fall short of the recommended amounts. Vitamins A & C are no longer required since deficiencies in these vitamins are rare today.Larger manufacturers have until July 26, 2018 to institute the new labeling requirements. Small businesses have an additional year to comply.Related tickers: (XLP)(VDC -0.1%)(FXG -0.6%)(IYK)(PBJ -0.6%)(PSCC -0.7%)(OTCPK:NSRGY -0.4%)(PG -0.2%)(UL -0.2%)(PEP +0.3%)(KO +0.3%)(GIS -0.1%).
