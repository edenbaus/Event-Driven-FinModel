Lenders lead advance as House's Hensarling lays out his plans

Writing in the WSJ last night, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee called the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau a rogue agency, purposely created to be insulated from Congressional, presidential, or voter oversight."The regulatory web spun by the CFPB can make every provider of financial services guilty until proven innocent, inviting selective enforcement and financial shakedowns."He notes Dodd-Frank specifically excluded auto lenders from CFPB jurisdiction, but that hasn't stopped Richard Cordray (CFPB chief) and company, as the likes of Santander Consumer (SC +1.2%), Ally Financial (ALLY +1%), and Credit Acceptance Corp. (CACC +1.9%) have found out. The House two years ago voted overwhelmingly voted to stop the CFPB's efforts in this area, but Elizabeth Warren was able to halt the bill in the Senate.The president, says Hensarling, should fire Richard Cordray yesterday, put in place a new director to undo all harmful actions taken by the agency, and then get to work putting policies to work that actually protect consumers.Even with better leadership, though, the CFPB would still be unconstitutional, he continues, so the agency must be "functionally terminated" through a simple majority vote to cut off funding (which comes from the Fed, not Congress).In other Hensarling news, Bloomberg has seen a memo outlining other Dodd-Frank reforms, including reducing stress tests to just every other year.XLF +1.3%, KRE +1.5%, KBE +1.3%OneMain (OMF +4.4%), BofA (BAC +1.6%), Citigroup (C +1.7%), Wells Fargo (WFC +1.7%), JPMorgan (JPM +1.3%), Goldman Sachs (GS +1.7%), Morgan Stanley (MS +2.2%), Regions (RF +2.7%), KeyCorp (KEY +1%), SunTrust (STI +1.6%), BB&T (BBT +1.1%), M&T (MTB +1.2%), Zions (ZION +2%).
