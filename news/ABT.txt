Abbott to back out of Alere deal
Abbott (ABT -1.5%) files a complaint in a Delaware court seeking to terminate its planned $5.8B acquisition of point-of-care diagnostics outfit Alere (ALR -0.4%). The deal has been on the rocks amidst criminal and civil investigations into its business practices and revelations about inappropriate revenue recognition.Abbott spokesman Scott Stoffel says, "Alere is no longer the company Abbott agreed to buy 10 months ago. These numerous negative developments are unprecedented and are not isolated incidents brought on by chance. We have attempted to secure details and information to assess these issues for months and Alere has blocked every attempt. This damage to Alere's business can only be the result of a systematic failure of internal controls which, combined with the lack of transparency, led us to file this complaint."The deal was announced almost a year ago.Previously: Abbott Labs buys Alere for $5.8B; shares up 46% premarket (Feb. 1)

Abbott files lawsuit against Alere in effort to obtain merger-related information
Abbott's (NYSE:ABT) pending takeover of Alere (NYSE:ALR) remains rocky and contentious. Yesterday, it filed a breach-of-contract lawsuit against the point-of-care diagnostics firm in an effort to obtain documentation and other information as stipulated under their merger agreement. The information relates to its business practices that are under U.S. criminal and civil investigations under federal anti-corruption and anti-kickback laws.Abbott spokesperson Scott Stoffel says his company's intent is to gain access to the information before the transaction is completed so it can understand the issues and address them promptly, not to ask the court to back out of the deal. He adds that his organization has been unsuccessful in obtaining the information despite months of effort.Alere sued Abbott in late August accusing it of dragging its feet in securing antitrust approval for the merger. The drop dead date is April 30, 2017. Last month, the companies agreed to use a mediator to resolve their differences. Earlier this year, Abbott reportedly offering Alere $50M to terminate the marriage but it refused.

Obama hopeful about Zika funding bill
After meeting with the top four congressional leaders on Monday, President Obama said he was encouraged that lawmakers would be able to reach an agreement on funding to fight the Zika virus.In February, Obama had asked Congress to approve $1.9B in emergency funds to battle Zika with diagnostic tools and vaccines, but disagreements over side issues related to abortion led to divisions about full funding.Related tickers: SNY, ABT, INO, AEMD, XON, CEMI, BCRX, TMO, OTCQB:GOVX, OSUR Sep. 13, 2016, 2:49 AM | 19 Comments

Abbott and Alere to mediate merger dispute
Alere (ALR +0.2%) and cold-footed Abbott Laboratories (ABT -0.2%) have agreed to work with a mediator to settle their disagreements over Abbott's now-rocky $5.8B bid for the point-of-care diagnostics firm. According to court filings, the companies are considering former Delaware Chancellor William Chandler for the job. Alere recently filed a lawsuit in Delaware to force Abbott to follow through on its offer.Abbott appears to have lost enthusiasm for the deal at its current valuation, influenced, no doubt, by a rash of problems at Alere including restating financials due to inappropriate revenue recognition and a government inquiry into its billing and marketing practices.Alere has accused Abbott of cooling to the deal because of its $25B St. Jude Medical takeover. Abbott counters by saying the delay in closing the transaction is due to Alere's failure to file its regulatory submissions on time.Read now Merger Arbitrage - Alere and Abbott Sep. 8, 2016, 1:07 PM | 7 Comments
Candidate Clinton has an Rx for unjustified drug price hikes
In a factsheet just published on Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's website, she outlines her plan to reign in rogue drug companies who aggressively increase the prices of their medicines.Her plan features three methods for containing runaway drug costs: make alternatives available and increase competition; enable emergency importation of safe treatments and fine drug firms for unjustified price increases.Her first action, as President, will be to create a dedicated group of representatives from Federal agencies that oversee health and safety and fair competition that will be charged with protecting consumers from "outlier" price increases. The group will establish criteria for determining if a price increase is justified for a long-available treatment and investigate and consider enforcement in certain situations.In cases where the level of competition is light, her plan will enable the emergency purchases of alternative versions and make them available to patients in need while encouraging competition from additional suppliers.She also calls for legislation to safely and securely import drugs from foreign nations whose regulatory regimes are as robust as the FDA, with the proviso of a "careful review" by the agency (more temporary than permanent).In cases where miscreant drug firms are fined, the funds will be used to support new programs to make lower-cost alternatives available and speed up approvals in order to beef up competition (specifics are not provided).In her broader plan to lower prescription drug costs for all Americans, she proposes a cap on out-of-pocket costs, additional funding to support the clearing of the FDA's backlog of generic drug applications, prohibit "pay for delay" deals (long overdue), a moratorium on direct-to-consumer advertising and allowing Medicare to negotiate drug and biologic prices.Representative tickers: (NASDAQ:IBB)(NASDAQ:AMGN)(NASDAQ:BIIB)(NASDAQ:GILD)(NASDAQ:CELG)(NYSE:BMY)(NYSE:ABT)(NYSE:MRK)(NYSE:PFE)(NASDAQ:MYL)(NYSE:VRX)(NASDAQ:TEVA)(NASDAQ:PRGO)(NYSE:AGN) Sep. 2, 2016, 1:19 PM | 454 Comments
Singapore confirms locally transmitted Zika cases
Singapore authorities have identified 41 Zika cases that were transmitted locally, and warned that they expect to find more.The cases appear to be the largest single beachhead the virus has made in Asia in the current epidemic, which has also been detected in countries like Bangladesh, Malaysia and the Philippines.On Thursday, China added the U.S. to a list of Zika-infected countries, worrying U.S. exporters, who fear they will be required to fumigate containers destined for Chinese ports.Related tickers: SNY, ABT, INO, AEMD, XON, CEMI, BCRX, TMO, OTCQB:GOVX, OSUR

Alere files lawsuit to force Abbott to complete acquisition
Abbott's (ABT +0.4%) wobbly deal to acquire point-of-care diagnostics outfit Alere (ALR -1.9%) just got nastier. Yesterday, the Waltham, MA-based firm filed a complaint in Delaware Chancery Court aiming to force Abbott to go through with its $56/share offer ($5.8B) announced earlier this year. Abbott is trying to back out of the transaction because it has lost confidence in the robustness of Alere's internal controls. In April, Abbott reportedly offered Alere $50M to call it off, an offer it rejected.Five months after Abbott announced the intended takeover, Alere disclosed that it would need to restate its annual financial statements for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015, in addition to two interim reports for 2015, due to revenue recognition issues in certain ex-U.S. markets. It also stated that it expected to report one or more material weaknesses in its disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting.A short time later, the news broke that Alere was being investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice over its government billing practices in its toxicology unit, specifically the offering of inducements to doctors to order its tests. The Feds regard these activities as illegal kickbacks.Previously: Alere almost there with 2015 10-K filing; analysts say Abbott deal on track; ALR shares up 8% (July 15)Previously: Alere in Feds' crosshairs over billing practices as woes mount; Abbott deal on the rocks; shares slump 30% at close (July 27) Aug. 26, 2016, 11:47 AM | 36 Comments
FDA recommends Zika screening of blood components in all states and territories
The FDA revises its guidance on screening whole blood and blood components for the Zika virus. It now recommends all U.S. states and territories implement testing to ensure the safety of the blood supply. Collection/processing centers can use either an investigational test authorized by the FDA under an IND or a licensed test when available.In February, the agency recommended the safety measure only in areas with active Zika virus transmission. All such areas (i.e., FL and Puerto Rico) are now in compliance with the guidance.Related tickers: (NASDAQ:CEMI)(NASDAQ:OSUR)(NYSE:SNY)(NYSE:ABT)(NASDAQ:AEMD)(NYSE:TMO)(OTCQX:RHHBY)(OTCPK:SIEGY) Aug. 26, 2016, 11:01 AM | 1 Comment
Abbott's 'inhuman and unnatural' pressure to sell led one salesman to suicide
“I’m going to commit suicide because I can’t meet my company’s sales targets and my company is pressuring me," the suicide note from an Abbott (NYSE:ABT) salesman who killed himself recently read.A six-month investigation by the NYT finds that in the push to win customers in India’s highly competitive drug market, some Abbott managers instructed employees to pursue sales at virtually any cost - in violation of Indian law, professional medical standards and the company’s own ethics guidelines.Some experts say its aggressive tactics raise the prospect that people may be inappropriately diagnosed and could receive unnecessary treatment.

Alere in Feds' crosshairs over billing practices as woes mount; Abbott deal on the rocks; shares slump 30% at close
The problems continue to mount for point-of-care diagnostics firm Alere (NYSE:ALR). The latest stumble is the news that U.S. Department of Justice investigators have requested information from the company about its government billing practices, specifically its toxicology unit, which provides drug testing for employers and government bodies. The business accounts for about a quarter of Alere's revenues.The company received a subpoena last month seeking patient billing records. Its specific area of interest is Alere's efforts to collect co-payments from patients and alleged submission of forms to government programs like Medicare on patients' behalf. Federal law prohibits healthcare firms from covering payments for patients insured under programs like Medicare and Medicaid. The feds are also looking into whether Alere made payments or provided other inducements to doctors in order to influence their ordering of its tests. The government regards these activities as illegal kickbacks. The situation has the earmarks of a whistleblower suit.In February, Alere agreed to be acquired by Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) for almost $6B. Since then, however, the company has faced one embarrassing snafu after another, including having to restate its financial reports due to inappropriate revenue recognition (including "bill-and-hold" activities in China) and recalling products due to safety concerns related to the potential misreporting of results.In April, Abbott purportedly offered to pay as much as $50M to back out of the deal, a proposal Alere's board rejected. It is a virtual certainty that Abbott will wash its hands of Alere, though. It's just a matter of price at this point.Shares were down 29% today, but have rebounded 7% after hours on robust volume.Read now A Deal Worth A Leer Update: In a statement, the company says the billing records of interest, dating back to 2010, are related to its Austin, TX pain management laboratory. It is fully cooperating with the inquiry. It also says the billings in question accounted for less than 1% of its revenues and the matter is "not material." Jul. 27, 2016, 5:58 PM | 7 Comments

FDA OKs Abbott's Symfony Intraocular Lenses
The FDA approves Abbott Medical Optics' (ABT -0.4%) Tecnis Symfony Extended Range of Vision Intraocular Lens (IOL), the first IOL that provides cataract patients with an extended depth-of-focus, enhancing visual acuity over a range of distances. The FDA approval includes the Tecnis Symfony Toric IOL for patients with astigmatism (misshapen cornea).By age 80, over 50% of Americans have a cataract or have had cataract surgery. About 4M cataract surgeries are performed each year in the U.S. with ~25% being performed on people younger than 65. During the procedure, the natural lens of the eye is removed and the IOL is inserted. Typically, IOLs are monofocal (clear vision at a distance), but the Symfony enables clear near and intermediate vision as well. Jul. 15, 2016, 3:39 PM | 7 Comments
Alere almost there with 2015 10-K filing; analysts say Abbott deal on track; ALR shares up 8%
In a statement, point-of-care diagnostics firm Alere (ALR +7.6%) confirms that will restate its annual financial statements for 2013, 2014 and 2015 and interim statements for the periods ended March 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015 after identifying the specific revenue recognition issues that have delayed the filing of its 2015 reports.The specific areas pertaining to the timing of revenue recognition were mainly confined to Africa, where revenue was recorded when product was shipped to the distributor but the title did not transfer until the distributor paid for the products in full or the distributor was not obligated to pay the bill until the products were sold to end users.Another problem was "bill and hold" transactions (an invoice is generated but the product remains in inventory), principally in China (any legitimate accounting firm will consider this a significant "no-no").There were other unspecified transactions where Alere recognized revenue prior to satisfying all the contractual criteria for the transfer of title and risk to the customer.The company says the revisions will not be material since they do not impact the total amount of recorded revenue other than the change brought about by establishing a returns allowance for its Indian subsidiary. It plans to file its 2015 financials as soon as feasible, followed by its Q1 2016 10-Q. It admits that it expects to report one or more material weaknesses in its disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.On a preliminary basis, revenue ($M) for 2015 and Q1 2016 will be $2,447 - 2477 and $573 - 593, respectively. Net income will be $10 - 25 and $(8) - 2, respectively, and non-GAAP EBITDA $505 - 520 and $106 - 116.Analysts expect the $5.8B takeover by Abbott Laboratories (ABT -0.4%) to proceed.

Alere voluntarily withdraws INRatio and INRatio2 PT/INR Monitoring System from U.S. market
Following a collaborative process with the FDA, point-of-care diagnostic firm Alere (NYSE:ALR) will be initiating a voluntary withdrawal of its Alere INRatio and INRatio2 PT/INR Monitoring System.In December 2014, the company initiated a voluntary correction to inform users of the device that patients with certain medical conditions should not be tested with the product due to the potential misreporting of results. Over the past two years, Alere updated the software to address the issue. At the end of 2015, the FDA notified the company that it did not agree that the problem was fixed and advised the company to submit a plan for the voluntary removal of INRatio from the market.Alere is working with the FDA to determine the most appropriate timing for product discontinuation and will provide guidance on transitioning patients to an alternate solution to allow them to continue anti-coagulation monitoring in the least disruptive manner possible.Related ticker: (NYSE:ABT) Jul. 12, 2016, 8:01 AM

Abbott's FreeStyle Libre continuous glucose monitor enables type 1 diabetics to cut hypoglycemic time 38%
Results from a six-month study called IMPACT showed patients using Abbott Laboratories' (ABT -1.1%) continuous glucose monitor, FreeStyle Libre, reduced the time spent in hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) 38% compared to traditional systems that rely on self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) via a finger-stick blood sample. The data were presented at the 76th Scientific Sessions at the American Diabetes Association meeting in New Orleans, LA.IMPACT's primary endpoint was the difference in number of hours per day in hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) between the FreeStyle Libre cohort and the SMBG cohort from days 194 - 208. 252 adults participated in the study across 23 sites in Europe.Key findings included a 38% reduction in time spent in hypoglycemia, a 40% reduction in time spent in nocturnal (11 pm - 6 am) hypoglycemia and a 50% reduction in serious hypoglycemia (<55 mg/dL). In addition, there was no increase in HbA1c at month 6.FreeStyle Libre consists of a small round sensor worn on the back of the upper arm for up to 14 days, measuring glucose in interstitial fluid every minute through a small filament (5 mm long, 0.4 mm wide) inserted under the skin and held in place with a small adhesive pad. A smartphone-sized reader is scanned over the sensor to obtain a glucose result almost simultaneously.The device was approved in Europe in September 2014. Its marketing application was submitted in the U.S. in August 2015. Approval is expected later this year. Jun. 13, 2016, 3:37 PM

Abbott Labs continues slog through Depakote birth defect lawsuits; new trial in Illinois to start next month
Epilepsy drug Depakote (divalproex sodium) continues to be an albatross for inventor Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT). Originally approved by the FDA in 1978, it was once among the company's top sellers, pulling in $1.6B in sales in 2007 before going off patent.The company's promotional practices came under scrutiny when four whistleblower lawsuits were filed between 2007 and 2010 accusing the Abbott Park, IL firm of promoting off-label uses of the drug and paying kickbacks to prescribers to drive sales. In 2012, the company paid $1.6B to settle claims from the Feds and 24 states over its alleged illegal marketing of the product.Abbott's troubles with Depakote were far from over, though. Plaintiffs began filing personal injury lawsuits in August 2011, now totaling over 800, alleging the use of the drug during pregnancy caused birth defects, including spina bifida. The first suit to go to trial, Kaleta vs. Abbott Labs, was held in St. Louis. It ended with a $38M judgement against the company ($15M compensatory damages + $23M in punitive damages). In November 2015, however, Abbott prevailed in an Ohio case.Unsurprisingly, Abbott denies culpability and intends to vigorously defend itself in court. A new trial, slated to begin next month in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, will hear two cases at once. Judge Nancy Rosenstengel appears less than enthused about her crowded docket of pending Depakote cases, now totaling 13, saying she was "more than a little disappointed" over the impasse to settlement. Nevertheless, Abbott believes it will ultimately prevail, guaranteeing a lengthy process and healthy returns for lawyers. May 12, 2016, 6:12 PM

Theranos just another story of smoke and mirrors says NYT columnist Stross
Looking in the rear view mirror, author and New York Time columnist Randall Stross says the red flags were numerous surrounding discredited diagnostics firm Theranos and its relentlessly self-promoting chief Elizabeth Holmes.First, the company failed to elicit investments from the major Silicon Valley venture capital players despite numerous pitches/presentations. Professor Stross says it was turned down twice by GV (formerly Google Ventures) due to the apparent lack of substance (technical data) backing up its claims.Second, the company refused to publish in peer-reviewed journals, a tried-and-true way to credential the technology.Third, the make-up of the board was puzzling, since no member had experience in the diagnostics industry. Celebrity members, in this case former Secretary of State George Schultz and former National Security Advisor and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, reinforced the perception that the constituency was for show instead of advancing the business.At least Ms. Holmes is famous, sporting the covers of Fortune, Forbes, Inc., and T: The New York Times Style Magazine.

Alere down 7% on Abbott chief's non-committal comments during earnings call
Point-of-care diagnostics firm Alere (ALR -6.9%) slumps on an 80% spike in volume in apparent response to comments made by Abbott Labs' (ABT -0.3%) Chairman Miles White during this morning's Q1 earnings call. When asked about his commitment to the $5.8B deal, announced in February, he deferred and said it would be inappropriate to comment on the transaction, citing Alere's delay in filing its 2015 annual report.Alere received a notice of non-compliance from the NYSE last month over the matter. The reason for the delay is an analysis of certain aspects of the timing of revenue recognition (cutoff) in Africa and China for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015. Per NYSE rules, the company has six months from March 15 to file the 10-K.Read now Abbott's Acquisition Of Alere May Lead To Value Destruction For Abbott Shareholders  Apr. 20, 2016, 10:26 AM | 1 Comment

Theranos adds blue chip experts to advisory board; technology passes muster with leading scientists
Rumors doubting upstart blood tester Theranos' technology may be bit premature. The company recently hosted three scientific review sessions with leading experts who were invited to review its proprietary technologies with full access to its systems, devices and data. The group reviewed development and validation reports for tests performed on small volume samples, including finger-sticks, using Theranos' gear for a range of assays, including those chosen by the experts. They appear to have been favorably impressed.Co-chair of the company's Scientific and Medical Advisory Board David Helfet, M.D., director of the Orthopedic Trauma Service, Hospital for Special Surgery and New York-Presbyterian Hospital says, "It is clear that Theranos has done what people thought was impossible. Theranos invited groups of independent experts in the fields of pathology and laboratory medicine and literally took the lid off of the box. Experts were shown Theranos' technology, met with Theranos scientists and had access to any data. Theranos' technology is a ground-breaking feat of science and engineering, making it possible to accurately analyze micro amounts of blood for the same tests routinely done today with traditional venipuncture."After the three sessions, the company added eight prominent laboratory and medical experts to its Scientific and Medical Advisory Board. The group will advise company management and internal teams regarding the full integration of its technology into routine clinical practice. Those with laboratory management expertise will assist the company in inspecting its own labs and will help clinical lab directors implement best practices in their operations.Say what you will about the company and its "black box" technology, but it would not be possible to engage a large group of experts without technical credibility.Clinical diagnostics-related tickers: (NYSE:ABT)(OTCQX:RHHBY)(NYSE:TMO) Apr. 7, 2016, 4:39 PM | 2 Comments
FDA allows the use of Roche's investigational test for Zika to screen donated blood
With the aim of maintaining the safety of the nation's blood supply, the FDA allows the use of Roche's (OTCQX:RHHBY) investigational test for the Zika virus to be used to screen donated blood in areas with active mosquito-borne transmission. The agency's decision should reduce the pressure on Puerto Rico, which has been importing blood from the continental U.S. after suspending local collections to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to local patients.Per FDA guidance, local blood collections may resume if a licensed or investigational test for the Zika virus is available. The FDA's recommendations for Zika blood donor referrals remain in place.Related ticker: (ABT +0.5%)Update: Roche will roll out the test, performed on its automated cobas 6800/8800 systems, in Puerto Rico first, followed by sites in the southern U.S. Mar. 30, 2016, 11:26 AM
FDA panel gives unanimous go-ahead to Abbott Labs dissolving stent
An FDA advisory panel has given unanimous support to a one-of-a-kind dissolving heart stent from Abbott Laboratories (ABT -1.5%).The "Absorb" stent is made to dissolve within three years of implantation, after it restores blood flow to a blocked artery. In a 9-0 vote, the FDA's panel decided the benefits of Absorb outweighed the risks, forecasting a likelihood of full FDA approval.Such a stent would eventually provide more natural artery motion in comparison with Abbott's market-leading Xience metal stent, which is permanently implanted.If approved, the new stent would compete with those made by competitors: Resolute, by Medtronic (MDT -0.9%), and Synergy and Promus, from Boston Scientific (BSX -1.3%). Wells Fargo has estimated that Absorb could initially capture about 5% of the drug-eluting stent market. Mar. 15, 2016, 6:49 PM | 11 Comments
ViiV Healthcare's injectable HIV prevention regimen passes Phase 2 test; albeit with some discomfort to most participants
ViiV Healthcare, the HIV-focused joint venture between GlaxoSmithKline (GSK -1.1%), Pfizer (PFE -0.5%) and Shionogi Limited (OTC:SGIOF)(OTCPK:SGIOY), announces the results from a 41-week Phase 2a study, ECLAIR, assessing the safety, tolerability, dosing and satisfaction with long-acting, injectable cabotegravir as monotherapy for the prevention of HIV infection in adult males not at high risk of acquiring HIV. The data were presented at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Boston.ECLAIR randomized 127 HIV-negative subjects 5:1 to cabotegravir or placebo beginning with a safety assessment on oral cabotegravir 30 mg or placebo tablet for four weeks followed by an intramuscular injection of 800 mg cabotegravir or placebo (sterile saline) every 12 weeks for three cycles.The proportions of participants who completed three injections for cabotegravir and placebo were 93% (n=87/94) and 95% (n=20/21), respectively. The incidences of Grade 2 (moderate) to Grade 4 (life-threatening or disabling) adverse events during the injection phase were 80% (n=75/94) and 48% (n=10/21), respectively. The most common Grade 2-4 AE was injection site pain (59% and 5%, respectively). The incidences of all grades of adverse events during the injection phase were 98% (n=92/94) and 90% (n=19/21), respectively.Following repeat injections, 74% (n=67/91) favored long-acting cabotegravir over the oral version.ViiV intends to advance cabotegravir to Phase 3 development later this year.Related tickers: (NASDAQ:GILD)(NYSE:ABT)(NYSE:BMY)(NYSE:JNJ)(NYSE:MRK)(OTCQX:RHHBY) Feb. 24, 2016, 1:40 PM | 14 Comments

Competition fierce in India over HCV meds
HCV-positive Indians are benefiting from the intense competition between the 11 firms authorized to manufacture and distribute generic versions of Gilead Sciences' (NASDAQ:GILD) Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) in India. Market share-grabbing tactics include screening drives, free diagnostic test kits and bulk discounts to entire villages.Dr. Reddy's has established a venture with Arogya Finance to offer no-interest loans to patients while Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) has teamed up with French medical equipment firm Echosens SAS to supply Indian hospitals with 13 ultrasound machines for performing liver scans to determine the level of fibrosis without a liver biopsy. Scans can be performed for ~3,500 rupees (~US$53).The price per pill, initially $10 back in March, is now as low as $4.29, over 99% lower than the $1,000 per pill list price in the U.S.An estimated 12M Indians are HCV-positive. The incidence is greatest in the Punjab state where certain areas have as high as a 50% infection rate. Dec. 29, 2015, 7:34 AM | 58 Comments

BG Medicine and Abbott revise galectin-3 agreement to improve penetration of reference labs
BG Medicine (NASDAQ:BGMD) amends its License and Distribution Agreement with Abbott Diagnostics (NYSE:ABT) lowering the fees paid to BG for galectin-3 tests sold by Abbott to reference laboratories. The specific amount of the reduction is undisclosed. The original fees will remain unchanged for all other customer segments.BG chief Paul Sohmer, M.D., says, "We believe this modification to our agreement will open up a new customer segment for automated testing as well as expedite the transition for existing customers from manual to automated testing for galectin-3. We expect that, as a result, the majority of revenues currently generated from sales of manual test kits will, over time, likely be replaced by product fees generated from the sale of automated tests by our automated partners when their automated tests become available. This modification to our agreement further bolsters our efforts to accelerate adoption of galectin-3 testing.Abbott's Diagnostics Division is marketing the automated galectin-3 test as part of the test menu of its Architect immunoassay analyzer. The test is used to help identify chronic heart failure patients who are clinically stable but have a higher risk of adverse events such as hospitalization and mortality.

Walgreens halts openings of new Theranos centers
“We’re trying to figure out where we are and what we do going forward," a Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) source tells the WSJ. "We need to understand the truth."The drugstore chain has "no concrete plans at this stage" to expand its partnership with Theranos beyond the 41 stores in Arizona and California which already include Theranos "wellness centers," reports the Journal. That partnership also includes an equity stake in the startup.Walgreens made the move after meeting late this week with top brass at Theranos, including CEO Elizabeth Holmes. Said meeting came about after stories questioning the viability of the startup's technology. Walgreens was also unaware of the FDA's surprise inspection of Theranos facilities in August and September, according to sources.Previously: Theranos chief Holmes says technology sound (Oct. 21)Related tickers: Abbot Labs (NYSE:ABT), Quest Diagnostics (NYSE:DGX), Lab Corp.

Theranos chief Holmes says technology sound
During a technology conference in California hosted by the Wall Street Journal, Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes defended her company and its technology against critics who claim things are not what they seem at the high-flying early-stage firm.She said the company has moved away from one of its devices only briefly as it proceeds to getting FDA clearance for all of its tests. She also cites her personal involvement in enacting a law in Arizona that allows patients to get blood tests without a doctor's order, saying, "I personally in Arizona worked very hard to change the law. I can't do that without knowing that the tests that are offered are of the highest quality."Related tickers: (ABT +1.2%)(OTCQX:RHHBY -1%)(LH -1.2%)(DGX -0.7%)Previously: Upstart Theranos has arrived, the ax grinding has begun (Oct. 16)Previously: FDA clears upstart Theranos' test system (July 2) Oct. 21, 2015, 12:44 PM | 9 Comments

Upstart Theranos has arrived, the ax grinding has begun
Start-ups, especially biotechs, typically enjoy an "image honeymoon" period with stakeholders, constituency groups and the press as they try to pull themselves up from a "little company that could" to establishing themselves as sustainable enterprises and legitimate players in their respective markets. Anyone remotely familiar to the biotech arena knows how extraordinarily difficult it is to pull this off so it is rare to see anything but encouraging references to the upstarts as they pursue their visions of successful disruptions and the monetary rewards that follow. Once the company gets momentum and grows in size and valuation, the situation evolves as insiders position themselves for the big payday and competitors wake up to the potential threat. Those who feel threatened or disadvantaged typically use the press to drum up negative news either as "payback" for being excluded from the money train or to dim the aura of the upstart's halo.Palo Alto, CA-base Theranos is a case in point. The medical diagnostics firm, started by a teen-aged Stanford University drop-out in 2003, now sports a $9B market cap based on the disruptive potential of its automated microfluidics-based system to the $50B global diagnostics industry. Founder Elizabeth Holmes is a billionaire at age 31. The enormous amount of money at stake inevitably leads to "haves" and "have-nots."An article published in the Wall Street Journal yesterday is a superb example of this dynamic. The reporter based his article on information provided by four former (disgruntled) employees who allege that Theranos' dream is quite a distance from reality, saying, among other things, that most of the tests currently being offered are performed by traditional instruments rather than its proprietary Edison system. Other missteps cited in the article, such as providing an incorrect result, occur every day in the diagnostics industry. The selective use of individual examples paints a very biased view of reality. Some of the information may be true, but it is impossible to determine fact from fiction. No one said being a billionaire was easy.Previously: FDA clears upstart Theranos' test system (July 2)Previously: Upstart Theranos receives CLIA waiver for test system clearing the way for rapid diagnostics in Wellness Center setting (July 16)Related tickers: (LH +0.7%)(DGX +1.5%)(ABT -0.4%)(OTCQX:RHHBY +1.6%) Oct. 16, 2015, 2:00 PM | 18 Comments
One-year data show Abbott's Absorb stent on par with XIENCE
Results from a late-stage clinical trial, called ABSORB III, showed Abbott's (NYSE:ABT) fully dissolving Absorb heart stent was non-inferior (no worse than) to its top-selling XIENCE metallic drug-eluting stent. The results, presented today at the 27th Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics annual scientific symposium of the Cardiovascular Research Foundation, were used to support a regulatory application in the U.S.The data from ABSORB III demonstrated that there was no statistically significant difference in the two devices after one year. Specifically, the target lesion failure rate (the primary endpoint) for Absorb and XIENCE was 7.8% and 6.1%, respectively (non-inferiority p<0.007). All other pre-specified secondary endpoints were not statistically different, including the rate of definite and/or probable stent thrombosis (blood clot).During the meeting, Abbott also presented results from ABSORB China, a 480-subject study comparing Absorb to XIENCE that was conducted to support regulatory approval there. The primary endpoint, non-inferiority defined by in-segment late loss at one year, was also met (non-inferiority p=0.01).Absorb is currently cleared in over 100 countries. The company's regulatory application has been filed in the U.S. and will be filed in China in the near future. Oct. 12, 2015, 4:38 PM

Abbott's fully dissolving heart stent non-inferior to XIENCE stent in Japan study
One-year results from Abbott's (NYSE:ABT) ABSORB Japan clinical trial show that its fully dissolving Absorb heart stent was non-inferior (no worse than) its XIENCE permanent drug eluting stent (p<0.0001). Target lesion failure (TLF), the primary endpoint, was 4.2% for Absorb compared to 3.8% for XIENCE. TLF is a composite of heart disease-related deaths, heart attacks attributed to the treated vessel and repeat procedures with the treated lesion caused by ischemia (lack of oxygen), powered for non-inferiority at one year.The data will be presented today at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in London.Fully dissolving stents are the "next big thing" in percutaneous coronary intervention because they enable the blood vessel to restore more naturally over time, something permanent stents cannot achieve.Absorb is commercially available in more than 90 countries, but not yet in Japan and the U.S. Sep. 1, 2015, 7:44 AM

Upstart Theranos receives CLIA waiver for test system clearing the way for rapid diagnostics in Wellness Center setting
The FDA grants a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) Waiver to privately-held Theranos for its diagnostic test system. The waiver allows the testing to be performed in non-traditional locations such as Theranos Wellness Centers, currently 42 in Arizona, one in Palo Alto, CA and one in Harrisburg, PA.The automated system the company has developed utilizes microfluidics to perform a wide array of tests on small volume blood samples, including those from a finger stick. Some observers believe Theranos will upend the clinical diagnostics industry with its modest costs. The company's herpes test, for example, will sell for only $9.07 compared to ~$175 from leading reference labs.Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes is one the newest celebrity entrepreneurs. Based on the company's current valuation, she is the youngest self-made female billionaire in U.S. history.Related tickers: (NYSE:ABT) (OTCQX:RHHBY) (NYSE:TMO) (NYSE:DGX) (NASDAQ:BRLI) (NYSE:LH) Jul. 16, 2015, 8:04 AM | 1 Comment

Although, the launch of the automated test means that BG will be less reliant on sales of the manual version, Health Diagnostics' continued financial troubles could have a material effect on BG's business.Health Diagnostic Laboratory accounted for 80% of BG's sales for the fiscal year ended December 2014 and 60% of its top line in Q1 2015.Abbott's (NYSE:ABT) Diagnostics Division is marketing the automated Galectin-3 Test as part of the test menu of its Architect immunoassay analyzer. The test is used to help identify chronic heart failure patients who are clinically stable but have a higher risk of adverse events such as hospitalization and mortality.Previously: BG Medicine up big on approval of automated test (Dec. 30, 2014) Jul. 6, 2015, 7:46 AM | 2 Comments
FDA clears upstart Theranos' test system
The FDA issues 510(k) clearance for privately-held Theranos' diagnostic testing system and its test for herpes simplex 1 IgG, the 153rd test that the company provides for less than $10 in its service offering. The automated system the company has developed utilizes microfluidics to perform a wide array of tests on small volume blood samples, including those from a finger stick. Some observers believe Theranos will upend the clinical diagnostics industry with its modest costs. The herpes test, for example, will sell for only $9.07 compared to ~$175 from leading reference labs.Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes is one the newest celebrity entrepreneurs. Based on the company's current valuation, she is the youngest self-made female billionaire in U.S. history.Some diagnostics-related tickers: (NYSE:ABT) (OTCQX:RHHBY) (NASDAQ:QDEL) (NYSE:BIO) (NASDAQ:QGEN) (NASDAQ:CPHD) (NASDAQ:CEMI) (NASDAQ:TRIB) (NASDAQ:AXDX) (NASDAQ:CBMX) (NYSE:TMO) Jul. 2, 2015, 4:07 PM

California Supreme Court says no to pharma's pay-for-delay deals
In a setback for branded drug makers, the California Supreme Court rules that financial payments from makers of patented drugs to competitor firms to delay the commercialization of cheaper generic versions of their branded medicines, called pay-to-delay deals, illegally restrain trade and violate the Cartwright Act, the state's primary antitrust law.The court reversed a summary judgement to Bayer (OTCPK:BAYRY) and Barr, whose $398.1M deal blocked the launch of generic versions of the antibiotic Cipro (ciprofoxacin) for almost seven years. It found it was immaterial that the companies' agreement settled patent litigation since antitrust principles prohibit a patentee's purchase of a potential competitor's consent to stay out of the market, even when the patent is likely valid.The Court's rule also applies to collusive non-cash settlements. An excerpt from its opinion reads: "courts considering Cartwright Act claims should not let creative variations in the form of consideration result in the purchase of freedom from competition escaping detection."The U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit last year against AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) charging the firms with violating antitrust laws and harming consumers with their pay-to-delay transactions related to AndroGel testosterone replacement therapy.

FDA to hold public meeting on off-label drug promotion
Spurred by the progress of a bill moving through Congress that will speed new drugs to market for conditions lacking cures, called The 21st Century Cures Act, the FDA has scheduled a public meeting this summer to address concerns by the drugs industry that regulatory restrictions on what they can say about the off-label use of their products violates their First Amendment right to free speech. Language in the bill is ratcheting up the pressure on the agency to relax its guidelines.Drug makers were emboldened on its prospects of changing the rules after an appeals court overturned the conviction of a pharmaceutical sales representative in 2012 who was convicted of promoting off-label uses of the narcolepsy drug Xyrem. The court ruling was based on First Amendment protection for truthful and non-misleading off-label speech.The American Medical Association supports the need for physicians to have access to accurate and unbiased information about off-label uses of drugs since it already accounts for as much as 20% of prescribing, with higher levels in oncology and pediatric rare diseases.Giving drug firms more leeway in this arena has its detractors, however. Rita Redberg, M.D., Professor of Medicine at the UC-San Francisco says, "At my own medical center we have banned pharmaceutical reps from coming because we don't think they are a good source of information. You don't ask the barber if you need a haircut."Pharma companies have a dubious history of breaking the rules governing off-label promotion. Over the past 10 years, 17 firms have paid more than $16B in settlements related to inappropriate off-label selling.Further complicating matters is the fact that up to 75% of published pre-clinical trial results cannot be reproduced in later studies.ETFs: IBB, BIB, IRY, BIS, IXJ, DRGS Related tickers: (MRK +0.4%)(LLY -0.1%)(PFE +0.3%)(BMY +0.7%)(GSK -4.1%)(OTCQX:RHHBY -1.1%)(SNY -0.6%)(OTCPK:BAYRY -0.5%)(NVS +0.1%)(AZN -0.3%)(JNJ +0.2%)(ABT -0.1%)(ABBV +0.1%) May 7, 2015, 11:13 AM | 6 Comments

Makers of pricey drugs working on new payment model
Facing ever-increasing pushback from payers over the high price of new treatments, some biotech firms are working on a new payment model that rewards them for the long-term performance of their drugs. Gene therapy developers, including BioMarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN +0.4%) and Sangamo BioSciences (SGMO -0.1%), are leading the effort.The industry says that a one-time cure, even if priced greater than $1M, saves money over the long term but acknowledges that payers will balk at paying the cost upfront. The general consensus is that an upfront payment over $1M will be unacceptable.Under a pay-for-performance scheme, the annuity-like payments would cease if medical testing showed that the therapy was not working. Much work remains to be done, though, before this approach could be implemented. For example, legislation may be required to force insurers to pick up the tab for patients that switch coverage.Some proponents of the new scheme say that the payment streams could be securitized and sold to investors, like consumer debt.Gene therapies represent the highest priced treatments. Only one has cleared the regulatory hurdle to date, UniQure's (QURE +1.5%) Glybera, which costs 850K euros ($1M) in Germany. It will be sold for a one-time payment because it is too difficult to measure how well it works (this reasoning will undoubtedly pop up again).Previously: UniQure sets price record with Glybera (Nov. 26, 2014)Related tickers: (CELG +1.3%)(AMGN -0.2%)(BIIB +0.5%)(GILD +0.1%)(MRK -0.3%)(GSK -0.2%)(AZN +0.9%)(LLY +0.3%)(NVS +0.1%)(PFE -0.5%)(JNJ -0.3%)(OTCQX:RHHBY +1.4%)(BMY -0.4%)(ABT)(BAX -1.1%) Feb. 19, 2015, 10:10 AM | 32 Comments

Express Scripts is Biotech's Grinch
Express Scripts' (NASDAQ:ESRX) success in containing the prices of new HCV therapies by pitting Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) against AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) is sending shock waves through the biotech/pharma industry. Most of the big players slumped yesterday as investors fear that ESRX's tactics will spread to other high cost areas like cancer and cholesterol.At JPM15 yesterday, CEO George Paz said that the new cholesterol-lowering post-statin PCSK9 inhibitors will be the next big opportunity to pit drug firms against each other in order to drive costs down. FDA clearance of the first two therapies, one from Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and the other from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) (NYSE:SNY), is expected to occur at about the same time.The prices of emerging cancer therapies will also be in payers' crosshairs.

Drug makers face pushback on pricey meds
Pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX) is at the forefront of an increasing wave of resistance to the high prices of new drugs from pharma and biotech firms, some which cost as much as $50K per month. Pharmaceutical spending in the U.S. is $270B and may breach $500B in five years. ESRX's method of controlling costs is to refuse to pay for them. For 2015, for example, it is excluding 66 branded drugs from its main formulary, an increase of 18 from 2014's 48. On the list is Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) rheumatoid arthritis drug Simponi (golimumab) which costs $3K per month.Other prescription benefits managers are employing similar tactics. CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) will exclude 95 drugs from its 2015 formulary including Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE) multiple sclerosis med Rebif (interferon beta-1a) which costs $5K for a four-week supply.Governments are pushing back as well. Among 42 state Medicaid programs, 27 pay for Gilead Sciences' HCV med Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) only for patients with severe liver damage while others impose coverage limitations for patients with recent substance-abuse problems.

Abbott's dissolving stent comparable to metallic version
In a randomized controlled trial, Abbott's (ABT +0.1%) absorbable scaffold, Absorb, performed comparably to the company's metallic stent, Xience, in patients with coronary artery disease.At one year, the patient-oriented clinical endpoint of all adverse events (death, heart attacks, revascularizations) was 7.3% for Absorb and 9.1% for Xience. The device-oriented clinical endpoint of target lesion failure was 4.8% for Absorb and 3.0% for Xience. The rate of definite stent thrombosis was 0.6% for Absorb.Absorb is a first-of-its-kind device that functions like a stent by opening a blocked artery and restoring blood flow, but dissolves over time. It is made of polyactide, the same material as dissolving sutures. It is the world's first drug-eluting vascular scaffold to be commercially available internationally. It achieved CE Mark clearance in Europe in January 2011. Sep. 15, 2014, 9:47 AM

Abbott and DoD team up on concussion tests
Abbott Laboratories (ABT +0.6%) and the Department of Defense will collaborate on developing portable blood tests to help evaluate potential concussions. The tests will be developed on Abbott's i-STAT System, a hand-held diagnostic analyzer.U.S. Army Medical Research and Material Command Brain Health Coordinator Col. Dallas C. Hack, M.D., says, "The quick and accurate diagnosis of a concussion is critical so that soldiers who are affected - whether in the battlefield or not - can be removed from duty to recover and to prevent further injury."Research suggests that certain proteins are released in the bloodstream following a brain injury. Detecting a mild traumatic brain injury such as a concussion can be difficult with imaging technology because it may not show abnormalities and the symptoms can be similar to or be mistaken for other conditions.

India likely to cap prices on more drugs
An Indian health ministry panel meets today to consider adding more drugs to the government's National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM). Membership on the list means that there is a cap on the price. It makes drugs more affordable for the >1B people, 70% who live on <$2/day.Many observers are surprised by the formation of the committee considering the business-friendly posture of new Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Last year the number of drugs on the NLEM increased from 74 to 348, covering ~30% of the total drugs sold in India.Drug firms can protest and complain, but in the end there is little they can do. Even if the NLEM expands further, India remains an attractive growth market for the industry.Related tickers: (GSK) (ABT) (PFE) Jun. 24, 2014, 7:15 AM
