Analysts foreseeing steady execution in Cisco Systems earnings
Don't expect "fireworks" in Cisco Systems' (CSCO +1.6%) fiscal Q2 earnings report after the closing bell, says Drexel Hamilton -- "just more execution."And perhaps some color on an acquisition of AppDynamics in the 11th hour before that company planned to go public.Switching and routing will keep weighing on results, says the firm's Brian White: He's modeling NGN Routing revenues down by 8% sequentially, Newer Products down 10, Switching down 12%, Other Products down 5% and Services up 2%. But the dividend (forward yield 3.22%) may be reason enough to own, he says.It's a tough quarter to forecast, says Credit Suisse's Kulbinder Garcha, but "expectations remain too high." Cisco had a 14-week quarter in fiscal Q3 2016, and Street estimates may be too high for the next quarter, he says. "Taking out the extra week, Street estimates are pointing to a revenue growth of ~6% Y/Y, which we believe is optimistic."The company's had tough competition from Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) and Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR), Garcha adds. Their strength shows an accelerated share shift is under way and means that "Cisco’s switching market position remains vulnerable, and switching revenues continued to decelerate."

Juniper Networks will seek new CTO as current one focuses on start-up
Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) says in an SEC filing and blog entry that its chief technology officer is cutting the time he spends at the company to focus on his start-up.The company and its executive VP and CTO Pradeep Sindhu have agreed to redefine his duties so that he can spend a majority of time at Fungible Inc., the company he co-founded in 2015.He'll stay with Juniper as executive VP and chief scientist, the company says, and it will search for a CTO successor.The move means Sindhu will give up his board seat as well, as he won't stand for re-election at the annual meeting.

Juniper hardware powering Tokyo Stock Exchange overhaul
The Tokyo Stock Exchange is going with Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) for a major upgrade to its trading platform, the company says.The TSE's proprietary trading system, "arrowhead," is going to "arrowhead v2" thanks to Juniper's MX480 3D Universal Edge Router.Previously, users required separate network connections based on a number of factors.

Bernstein resets Juniper Networks to Neutral stance
Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) has moved 0.9% lower after Bernstein downgraded the firm to Market Perform, from Outperform.Analyst Pierre Ferragu has updated Bernstein's price target, to $33 from a previous $30. That implies 15% upside from today's lower price.There's limited upside with shares trading about 10% below fair value, Ferragu suggests. "Following cautious guidance and the resignation of the CFO, Juniper fell heavily in the first five weeks of 2016. However, the stock has rebounded ~30% since this point on the back of excellent execution and momentum in its 'cloud' business in recent quarters." Mon, Jan. 9, 10:16 AM

Trading at $94.72 presently, analyst Mark Moskowitz highlights Arista Networks' (ANET +0.8%) arrangement with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, cloud positioning and routing market opportunity.Recalculates from $90 prior and maintains rating at Outperform.Update: On Arista Networks' routing possibilities, considers implications for major players like Juniper Networks (JNPR +1.8%) and to a more subdued extent, Cisco Systems (CSCO +1.2%).

Goldman makes Juniper Conviction Buy on Switching sales momentum
Goldman Sachs has added Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) to its Conviction Buy list, with an eye to momentum from the company's Switching product and upside ahead in its estimates.Switching makes up 17% of sales estimates, and Goldman sees Switching revenues at nearly $100M (10% higher than consensus), writes analyst Simona Jankowski.She has a price target of $31, near 19% upside from here.“Juniper’s new switching products expand its TAM in the high growth data center switching segment, where it can gain share from Cisco Systems and compete with Arista Networks," she writes. The company has seen good traction and with a last QFX product out in Q4, switching growth should accelerate from there. Nov. 16, 2016, 11:36 AM | 1 Comment
Juniper Networks -1.8% as Morgan Stanley cuts to Underweight
Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) is off 1.8% as Morgan Stanley downgrades shares to Underweight, noting shrinking partnerships in a time when the company faces headwinds in services margins.Analyst James Faucette cut the firm's price target on JNPR to $20, from $24, implying another 23% downside from today's price.Tech providers will need to subsidize initial investments for carriers moving to all-IP networks, Faucette notes. "Capital scarcity and negotiating leverage will pressure services margins, favoring vendors that leverage other technology providers' services arms. Cisco's partnership with Ericsson and Nokia's acquisition of Alcatel will force Juniper to bear the margin headwinds alone."Strategic options are probably limited, he says, and "Underinvesting in an overinvested industry elevates market share risk and pricing pressure."Over the weekend, FBN reiterated its Sector Perform rating and bumped its price target to $28 from $25.The company just noted that the National Credit Union Federation of Korea chose it for a major data center modernization project. The federation manages almost $62B in assets through 906 nationwide cooperatives. Nov. 1, 2016, 10:39 AM

Juniper tumbles on Q1 warning; Cisco also lower
Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) now expects Q1 revenue of $1.09B-$1.1B and EPS of $0.35-$0.37. That's below prior guidance of $1.15B-$1.19B and $0.42-$0.46, and a consensus of $1.18B and $0.45.The networking hardware vendor primarily blames "weaker than anticipated demand from Enterprise and timing of deployments of certain U.S. and EMEA Tier 1 Telecoms."

Official Q1 results are due on the afternoon of April 28.Juniper is down 8.4% after hours to $22.79. Carrier router archrival Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is down 1.5% to $27.20.

Juniper and Lenovo form data center hardware alliance
Looking to better compete against common rivals such as Cisco, HP, and Dell, Juniper (JNPR +1.5%) and Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) have struck a global reseller deal and product-integration partnership encompassing each company's data center hardware lineups.Some of the elements of the deal: 1) Companies will be able to buy Juniper's networking hardware from Lenovo, which bought IBM's x86 server unit in 2014. 2) Juniper and Lenovo plan to develop "simplified" data center management and orchestration tools using the latter's Network Director and Contrail SDN software, and the former's xClarity management software. 3) The companies plan to develop "go-to-market plans and a tailor-made resell model to address unique localization requirements in China."The deal is also said to cover hyper-converged (integrated server/storage/networking) and hyper-scale data center hardware - EMC, Cisco, HP, Dell, and Oracle are all going after the hyper-converged market, while many Internet companies (as well as some enterprises) have embraced hyper-scale data center architectures.Juniper's enterprise revenue rose 8% Y/Y in Q4 to $386.4M, and accounted for 29% of its total revenue. News of the Lenovo deal comes a week after Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) unveiled a refresh for its Nexus data center switch line, as well as new switch ASICs (referred to as Cloud Scale) said to deliver unmatched performance and latency.

Bernstein upgrades Juniper after post-earnings plunge, downplays guidance
Believing shares are at attractive levels following Thursday's 15.4% post-earnings drop, Bernstein's Pierre Ferragu has upgraded Juniper (NYSE:JNPR) to Outperform.

Terms are undisclosed.Juniper: "We expect the acquisition will allow Juniper to accelerate the delivery of open and automated packet optical transport solutions that integrate with our NorthStar [WAN SDN] Controller and include network management features that enable end-to-end provisioning of new services. The combination of BTI Systems’ accomplished team, innovative and open solutions with Juniper’s longstanding switching and IP routing expertise positions the company well to take advantage of the fast growing DCI and Metro markets."The metro/DCI optical networking segment is expected to see healthy growth, aided by 100G metro buildouts by carriers and growing optical network investments by Web/cloud data center owners. Ciena, Infinera, Cisco, Alcatel-Lucent, and Huawei are among the firms competing in this space. Jan. 26, 2016, 1:25 PM
Juniper downgraded by Bernstein and Oppenheimer, upgraded by Deutsche
Bernstein's Pierre Ferragu and Oppenheimer's Ittai Kidron have respectively downgraded Juniper (JNPR -0.1%) to Market Perform and Perform. Deutsche's Vijay Bhagavath has upgraded to Buy.Ferragu thinks 2015 catalysts (capital returns, cost cuts, rebounding demand) will have less of an impact going forward, and that margin gains and share count reduction could slow going forward. "For 2016, although we still expect strong quarters to be reported later this month and in Spring, we see the risk-reward of owning Juniper as less attractive,"Kidron thinks Juniper could be strategically isolated, given Nokia (a long-time Juniper partner) is set to acquire Alcatel-Lucent (a Juniper carrier router rival) and Cisco has formed an alliance with Ericsson (previously seen as a potential acquirer of Juniper).Bhagvath, by contrast, sees Juniper "disproportionately" benefiting from rising telco, cable MSO, and Web 2.0 service provider spending on 100G+ edge routing upgrades, and also forecasts 100G+ switching and next-gen security share gains. "Bigger Picture, we think current levels undervalue JNPR’s portfolio improvement story. Our $32 PT is a modest ~12x [estimated 2017 EPS]; a discount to ~14-15x [for] peers," Jan. 5, 2016, 11:21 AM
Juniper slumps as FBI probes firewall security breach
The FBI is investigating potential spying by a foreign government through a backdoor (made possible by the placement of "unauthorized" OS source code) within firewalls sold by Juniper's (JNPR -4.1%) NetScreen security hardware unit.Officials talking with CNN place China and Russia at the top of their suspect list - one describes the breach as akin to "stealing a master key to get into any government building." Juniper has issued an emergency security patch to remove the backdoor.Security pros are at a loss to figure out how hackers will able to modify Juniper's source code without the company knowing for years. An exec at security software firm Rapid7: "I suspect that this incident will trigger internal security audits across the industry and cause Juniper to drastically change their code review process."Juniper's security product revenue, pressured by the growth of Palo Alto Networks and other upstarts, fell 1% Y/Y in Q3 to $119.6M, and accounted for 13% of total product revenue.

Juniper down 8.1% after Ericsson partners with Cisco
Juniper (NYSE:JNPR) has been hit hard by news router archrival Cisco has struck a far-reaching alliance with mobile infrastructure giant Ericsson, a company many expected would bid for Juniper in response to the Nokia/Alcatel-Lucent deal.The Nokia/Alcatel deal, in turn, is viewed as a potential threat (given Alcatel competes with Juniper in the carrier router market) to Juniper's sales and R&D alliance with Nokia. To date, Nokia and Juniper have affirmed their partnership.Juniper is below $30 for the first time since beating Q3 estimates and providing strong Q4 guidance on Oct. 22. Last week, the company unveiled support for running 3rd-party networking apps and services on top of its Junos OS, along with a line of 25G/50G Ethernet switches running on the new version of Junos. A software solution (called Cloud CPE) for implementing and managing network functions virtualization deployments (NFV - allows many networking functions to be handled by software running on commodity hardware) was also announced.

Juniper up 4.2% on Q3 beat, strong Q4 guidance
In addition to beating Q3 estimates, Juniper (NYSE:JNPR) has guided for Q4 revenue of $1.29B (+/- $20M) and EPS of $0.57-$0.60, mostly above a consensus of $1.27B and $0.57.With the help of favorable comps, routing revenue rose 13% Y/Y in Q3 to $604.4M. Switching revenue grew 30% to $201.4M (share gains), while security revenue fell 1% to $119.6M (share loss). Americas, EMEA, and Asia-Pac sales all rose, as did both service provider and enterprise sales. The Americas were 57% of revenue, and service providers 64%.Boosting EPS: Job cuts led GAAP operating expenses to drop 3% Y/Y to $539.4M, after backing out one-time charges. $50M was spent on buybacks, much less than Q2's $600M and Q1's $400M.Shares have risen to $31.00 after hours, making new 52-week highs in the process.Q3 results, PR Oct. 22, 2015, 6:55 PM

Juniper M&A rumors pop up again
"I've been hearing Juniper (NYSE:JNPR) may go private for a while," says an "experienced [Silicon] Valley technology executive" speaking with Light Reading. "It's the same threat as Riverbed ... In Juniper's case, it would be cool…it is needed."The "threat" in question is pressure from activist Elliott Management, which had a stake in Riverbed prior to its acquisition by P-E firm Thoma Bravo, and has prodded Juniper to carry out major job cuts and capital returns. To date, Elliott hasn't publicly demanded a sale.Meanwhile, a "senior executive in the router sector" states Juniper has been looking for a buyer. In addition, Benzinga recently reported hearing "unconfirmed market chatter" (doesn't always pan out) that Juniper has hired Goldman to "assist it in handling offers to take the company private for $32 per share."Earlier this year, the Nokia/Alcatel-Lucent deal fueled speculation Ericsson would counter by bidding for Juniper. Ericsson has said it's open to a major acquisition, but hasn't yet pulled the trigger on such a deal.With a $10.9B market cap - a buyout might require a $13B+ price - Juniper would be a big fish for a peer or P-E firm to swallow.Yesterday: Juniper rallies after landing Stifel upgrade, announcing AT&T deal Oct. 6, 2015, 7:01 PM
Juniper rallies after landing Stifel upgrade, announcing AT&T deal
Stating checks indicate the company now has "strong traction" with web-scale data center owner (have been accounting for a rapidly growing share of telecom/data center capex), Stifel has upgraded Juniper (JNPR +2.9%) to Buy, and set a $32 target.Stifel adds Juniper's dependence on AT&T/Verizon has been declining, and that checks are positive for new products. The company was hit hard in 2014 and early 2015 by weak capex from U.S. wireline carriers.Separately, Juniper has announced AT&T has selected its Contrail software-defined networking (SDN) to automate and virtualize network functions for its AT&T Integrated Cloud (AIC) infrastructure. As of March, AIC had 29 physical sites where it ran virtualized (software-controlled/abstracted) network functions, with plans to add at least 40 in 2015.Juniper's SDN solution, the result of its 2012 acquisition of startup Contrail Systems, takes a more open standards-friendly approach to SDN than bigger rival Cisco's offerings.

As more stocks act in lock-step, Goldman eyes outsized gains for select 25
Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN), Viacom (NASDAQ:VIAB) and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) headline Goldman Sachs' list of 25 companies that could post outsized returns even as more and more stocks are moving in lock-step.Goldman’s picks come as return dispersion - the performance gap among stocks - has sunk lately amid turmoil in China and concerns about when the Fed will raise interest rates that has pushed stock correlations to their highest level since 2011.Given the low-dispersion setting, Goldman says investors should focus on these 25 stocks that have high “dispersion scores” and 15%-plus upside to the firm’s targets: WYNN, VIAB, DLTR, UAL, LUV, URBN, CBG, JNPR, MPC, NFLX, HBI, SIG, CRM, CERN, VLO, KMX, ENDP, CTSH, ISRG, ETFC, TSN, CCE, CI, REGN, GT Sep. 21, 2015, 6:52 PM | 59 Comments
Juniper follows up on Ruckus Wi-Fi deal by partnering with Aerohive
Three months after Juniper (NYSE:JNPR) announced a partnership with Ruckus (NYSE:RKUS) to offer solutions that pair the former's switches with the latter's Wi-Fi access points and management software, the company has announced a tie-up with Ruckus rival Aerohive (NYSE:HIVE).The solution combines Juniper's EX Series Ethernet switches, Junos Space network visualization/management software, and SRX Series next-gen firewalls with Aerohive's 802.11ac access points and HiveManager management software. A Juniper spokesman states the Ruckus deal focuses on education and hospitality clients, while the Aerohive deal "caters to retail, state and local government, and K-12 education."Both partnerships follow Juniper rival HP's purchase of Aruba Networks, with whom Juniper formed an alliance in 2014. Cisco, a rival of all the aforementioned firms, remains (by far) the enterprise Wi-Fi market's largest player. Sep. 17, 2015, 5:45 PM

Juniper partners with Ruckus in wake of HP-Aruba deal
Juniper (JNPR -0.1%) is partnering with carrier/enterprise Wi-Fi hardware and software vendor Ruckus (RKUS +0.7%) to offer enterprise, government, and education clients solutions that pair Juniper's EX Series Ethernet switches with Ruckus' ZoneFlex Wi-Fi access points and SmartZone Wi-Fi management software.The companies also plan to integrate their security and hardware provisioning tools, and products that lower the number of logical network devices that need to be managed by IT admins.The alliance comes shortly after HP (a Juniper Ethernet rival) acquired Ruckus rival Aruba Networks. Last year, Juniper announced a partnership with Aruba that bore a strong resemblance to the Ruckus deal. For now, Juniper says Aruba remains a partner.Dan Ferguson, the CEO of a Juniper channel partner: "Juniper teaming with Ruckus says Juniper is moving away from the Aruba relationship ... Juniper needs to team up with somebody in the wireless space -- they can't go to market with a big hole in their portfolio." Mark Robinson, the president of another channel partner: "It solidifies what everyone was thinking, which was that the whole Juniper-Aruba [relationship] was not going anywhere ... Ruckus has always been perceived positively in the marketplace. I think they're an innovative company." Jun. 23, 2015, 10:54 AM

Juniper -3%; MKM downgrades, cites carrier technology trends
Believing the bull case for the company is based on "faulty assumptions" that ignore major changes in carrier router usage, MKM's Michael Genovese has downgraded Juniper (NYSE:JNPR) to Sell, while keeping its target at $22.Specifically, Genovese argues tier-1 carriers appear committed to ""a multi-step network transition that includes fewer Routing nodes (more Optical nodes) and aggressive Router pricing demands near-term," and that they eventually want to "deploy more multi-purpose, standardized hardware and to open-up the network software to be more multi-vendor and programmable" (i.e. adopt SDN and NFV). Juniper client AT&T is among the carriers embracing the latter trend, via its Domain 2.0 initiative.Genovese also believes 2H15 consensus estimates - they assume rebounding telecom capex - are too high, and that Juniper is unlikely to be acquired by a larger vendor. Speculation about an Ericsson bid has been running high since the Nokia/Alcatel-Lucent deal.Shares remain up 21% YTD. They trade for 16x 2015E EPS. Jun. 1, 2015, 10:11 AM

Nokia/Alcatel spells business risk, M&A potential for Juniper and Ruckus
Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and Alcatel-Lucent's (NYSE:ALU) planned merger could unravel Nokia's R&D partnership/reseller deal with Juniper (NYSE:JNPR). Juniper, which has partnered with Nokia on solutions that pair the former's routers with the latter's base stations and mobile core network gear, counts Alcatel as its second-biggest rival (after Cisco) in the carrier router market, and also squares off against the company in other markets such as carrier SDN software.Ruckus (NYSE:RKUS) is another Nokia partner that could be in the crosshairs: The company competes against Alcatel in carrier Wi-Fi hardware, and has a reseller deal with Nokia that goes back to 2012. The deal was recently expanded to cover Wi-Fi/4G small cell systems.At the same time, the merger has fueled speculation one or more rivals could respond with acquisitions of their own. A potential acquisition of Juniper by mobile infrastructure giant Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) has especially been the subject of much talk.Ericsson is also viewed as a potential suitor for optical networking hardware vendors/fellow Alcatel rivals Ciena and Infinera. Ruckus has been seen as a potential M&A target for a long time. However, it currently competes against Ericsson, which bought Wi-Fi hardware vendor BelAir Networks in 2012.RF backhaul hardware maker DragonWave (NASDAQ:DRWI) could also lose business thanks to the merger; it bought Nokia's RF backhaul business in 2012. and maintains a reseller deal. However, H.C. Wainwright recently downplayed those concerns, arguing Alcatel's RF backhaul systems are expensive and clunky.Juniper and Ericsson report earnings on April 23, and Ruckus on April 30.

Juniper switch takes aim at Arista's financial services stronghold
Though Juniper's (NYSE:JNPR) switches and routers often rely on home-grown ASICs, the company's new "compute-integrated" QFX5100-AA data center switch runs on an Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Xeon server CPU. Meanwhile, a complementary "packet flow accelerator" module features an Altera (NASDAQ:ALTR) FPGA that can be programmed to run custom apps.Juniper claims the switch and module, which are aimed at financial services firms demanding high throughput and low latency, can eliminate the need for a separate server to handle data processing, along with the related network hops. Private Maxeler Technologies provides a programming environment for the FPGA.The switch and module begin shipping in Q3. Like Juniper's recently-launched QFX10000 data center spine switches, they take aim at fast-growing Arista (NYSE:ANET), whose low-latency switches have gained a strong following with HFT trading desks and other financial firms. Arista is no stranger to using x86 CPUs or Altera FPGAs in its hardware.Juniper rose 3.2% today; Arista rose 0.6%. Juniper's Q1 report arrives on April 23.An aside: Juniper's switch highlights the product synergies that could stem from an Intel acquisition of Altera; deal talks were reported two weeks ago.

Infinera +5.8%; MKM pleased with product launches
MKM's Michael Genovese is pleased with Infinera's (NASDAQ:INFN) recent unveiling of two new photonic integrated circuits (PICs) that will go into optical transport systems aimed at 100G metro networks. "PICs are the source of the company's competitive advantage in long haul, and we expect the new more flexible and granular PICs to form the basis of a compelling Metro 100G aggregation/Telecom product later this year."Infinera asserts its new PICs offer more flexibility by allowing capacity to be "divided at a granular optical level with each slice capable of being routed in a different direction as it exits the line card or the system housing it." One PIC (the ePIC-500) delivers 500Gbps of capacity at network hub locations, and the other (the oPIC-100) 100Gbps at network spoke locations.Infinera claims tests showed "an estimated average reduction of 28 percent in modules, 31 percent in power and 45 percent in bandwidth inefficiencies as compared to conventional, commercial off the shelf technologies that deliver single-wavelength or super-channel solutions for 100G, 200G or 400G."Genovese sees Infinera's addressable market expanding to ~$20B in 2018 from ~$5B in 2014 as it "competes in end-to-end Optical Transport including Metro and [data center infrastructure]," and as its systems handle traffic forwarding features traditionally handled by routers - the latter could pose challenges for Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Juniper (NYSE:JNPR).Infinera is once more within a dollar of a 52-week high of $19.48.

Goldman: Buy during buyback blackout period
Buyback-happy U.S. firms are prohibited from repurchasing shares from about five weeks prior to releasing quarterly earnings to about 48 hours after those reports. These blackout periods, says Goldman, may offer an especially tasty time for investors to pick up shares of their favorites."High valuations in the absence of corporate demand may weigh on stock prices," says Goldman's Amanda Sneider, and particular areas of focus are tech, consumer discretionary, and financials - they've accounted for more than 50% of buyback activity.Goldman's buyback blackout theme buys: SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK), Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO), Travelers (NYSE:TRV), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR), Xerox (NYSE:XRX), Torchmark (NYSE:TMK), F5 Networks (NASDAQ:FFIV), Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS), Aon (NYSE:AON), Moody's (NYSE:MCO), VeriSign (NASDAQ:VRSN), Hartford Financial (NYSE:HIG), Ameriprise (NYSE:AMP), Corning (NYSE:GLW), Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), Viacom (NASDAQ:VIAB), Legg Mason (NYSE:LM), XL Group (NYSE:XL), DirecTV (NASDAQ:DTV), Allstate (NYSE:ALL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), CBS (NYSE:CBS), Macy's (NYSE:M), Kohl's (NYSE:KSS).

Arista slumps following 1.6M-share block trade
A 1.6M-share Arista (ANET -2.7%) block trade (covers 2.4% of outstanding shares) was priced at $72.00 this morning, below a Monday close of $72.65. The data center switch upstart has fallen below $71 on a quiet day for equities.Some recent events: 1) Bernstein has speculated  EMC, whose ties with Cisco have become strained, could make a bid for Arista in spite of its steep multiples. "Arista has leading network switch technology, has strong alignment with EMC’s software defined vision, and has strong technology talent and a good working relationship with VMware." 2) Juniper (NYSE:JNPR) has launched a line of data center spine switches (meant for leaf-spine network architectures), hoping to grab a chunk of a a market Cisco and Arista currently dominate.

WSJ: Elliott wants more Juniper board seats, may push for sale
Elliott Management (has a 9% Juniper stake) has privately recommend a number of new Juniper (JNPR +1%) board candidates that the company "is in the early stages of examining," the WSJ reports.The activist reportedly wants Juniper to "add more industry experience" to its board, and (notably) "may push the board to explore a sale of Juniper," which currently sports a $9.1B market cap.Back in February, Juniper reached a standstill agreement with Elliott in which it agreed to add Violin Memory CEO/telecom industry vet Kevin DeNuccio and ex-Nortel COO Gary Daichendt to its board. Shortly before the deal, Juniper appeased Elliott by announcing several capital-return and cost-cutting moves.The WSJ's report follows November's surprise firing of CEO Shaygan Kheradpir in response to the board's disapproval of his leadership and handling of a customer negotiation. There has been speculation the customer in question was Verizon (Kheradpir's former employer), which has reportedly been testing the use of commodity data center switches that (together with routing/switching tech supplied by Juniper) could replace proprietary Juniper switches.

Cisco, Juniper in the crosshairs as Verizon tests bare-metal hardware
The Rayno Report states Verizon (NYSE:VZ) has launched a major trial of bare-metal (commodity) switches running on a networking OS and SDN switching software respectively supplied by startups Cumulus Networks and Pica8.Light Reading backs up the report, while adding Verizon "aims to determine whether bare-metal switches ... could eventually replace more expensive, proprietary Juniper Networks Inc. (NYSE:JNPR) equipment." Nonetheless, Rayno reports Juniper is a part of the trial, supplying "routing and switching technology that helps tie the network together with VXLAN [networking virtualization] technology."Though the trial is in its early stages, both sites report hearing it's a big deal, given the potential for bare-metal/white-box gear to replace proprietary hardware on a large scale. "[Verizon] can reduce their costs massively," says a Rayno source. The trial coincides with the deployment by Verizon's cloud services ops of an SDN solution using server-based hardware from Super Micro (NASDAQ:SMCI).Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), which maintains a 60%+ data center switch share and a leading position in the carrier router market, has already called white-box hardware its biggest threat. Internet giants have been quick to embrace SDN/white-box solutions - Facebook has even open-sourced a data center switch design - and AT&T is looking to adopt SDN through its Domain 2.0 initiative.Cisco's recently-launched ACI/APIC SDN/networking virtualization solution is gaining traction within the company's enterprise base, but critics call it too expensive/proprietary - pricing for an APIC controller runs from $40K-$58K, and software licenses for ACI-capable switches run from $3K-$15K. Meanwhile, Verizon, AT&T, and other carriers are hungry to cut wireline capex.Juniper has adopted an SDN strategy that's more friendly to open platforms, but there might be some internal dissent on that front. Rayno reports recently-ousted CEO Shaygan Kheradpir "was more pro-SDN than the existing Juniper management, which is more conservative about protecting its installed base."

Alcatel, Ciena, JDS, others drop following Cisco's earnings
Though Cisco is higher after beating FQ1 estimates and issuing soft FQ2 guidance, many telecom equipment and component/chip names are going in the opposite direction.At issue: Cisco reported a 10% Y/Y drop in service provider orders (-18% in the U.S.), while stating on its CC (transcript) it "saw dramatically reduced spend at several large U.S. service providers." The networking giant also suggested demand will remain weak during the next couple of quarters.The remarks came just a few days after AT&T set a 2015 capex budget of $18B (down from 2014's $21B), prompting a Monday selloff in equipment vendors and their suppliers.Today's decliners: ALU -3.8%.

Declaring its Project VIP network expansion effort ahead of schedule, AT&T has set a 2015 capex budget of $18B, down from 2014's $21B and below a prior forecast of $20B. The figure is equal to only 13% of AT&T's 2015 revenue consensus.Telecom equipment and optical component makers, many of whom have already felt the effects of AT&T's subdued 2014 wireline capex, are off in early trading.

Ericsson, Juniper lead telecom equipment/component stocks lower
Though Ericsson (ERIC -3%) beat Q3 estimates, the mobile infrastructure giant stated North American business activity "slowed down during the quarter as operators currently focus on cash flow optimization." It added North American spending patterns make it tough to judge near-term demand.Ericsson's North American sales fell 3% Y/Y to $1.93B, partly offsetting strong growth in China, India (+56%), the Middle East (+38%), and other emerging markets. Top-line figures were boosted some by M&A.AT&T and Verizon have been taking cautious approaches to capex, and Sprint (though investing heavily in 4G following the SoftBank deal) has been looking to cut costs under new CEO Marcelo Claure. The U.S. and Japan have been ahead of many other developed markets in ramping 4G coverage.Juniper (JNPR -6.3%) offered light Q4 guidance two weeks after delivering a Q3 warning, and reported its service provider sales were down 6% Y/Y due to soft demand from Asia-Pac, EMEA, and (especially) U.S. carriers.When the world's #2 carrier router vendor was asked on the CC (transcript) about 2015 sales, CEO Shaygan Keradpir admitted Juniper has poor near-term visibility, and that a rebound could take time. "Because we think these cycles typically take 2 to 4 quarters ... our planning assumption is that growth will return in the second half of 2015."Nokia and Infinera recently offered more positive numbers/commentary. Bulls have argued strong data/video traffic growth will lift capex. Bears have argued soft (if not negative) carrier revenue growth will continue pressuring spending.Decliners: ALU -1.6%. JDSU -2%.

Telecom equipment/component stocks rally following Adtran's earnings
In an encouraging sign for beaten-down telecom equipment and chip/component stocks, Adtran (ADTN +5.7%) managed to rally even though it guided on its Q3 CC (transcript) for a low-to-mid teens Q/Q revenue drop. Consensus (doesn't appear to have fully accounted for Adtran's Q3 warning) was for revenue to drop 2% to $154.9M in Q4.Adtran attributed much of its Q3 weakness to "a decline in Europe as a large project there had a seasonal slowdown." Enterprise softness also took a toll.The company "[expects] to see an upturn in this business" in 2015, but European sales are expected to remain soft in Q4. Other equipment vendors, such as Juniper (JNPR +2%) and Ciena (CIEN +2.7%), have provided weak guidance blamed on U.S. wireline capex; AT&T is generally seen as a big culprit.In addition to Juniper and Ciena, many other industry names have closed with healthy gains.

Cisco, Alcatel, others sell off following Juniper/Procera's warnings
Telecom equipment makers and their chip/component suppliers are seeing more pain after Juniper (JNPR -7.5%) and Procera (PKT -32%) issued Q3 warnings (I, II), the latest bad earnings news for an industry that has seen plenty due to soft wireline capex. A few enterprise-focused networking vendors are also having a rough day.Cisco (CSCO -3.1%) has fallen below $23.50, and Alcatel-Lucent (ALU -4.3%) below $2.50. Other decliners: CIEN -4.7%.

NPTN -7.7%.Analysts are defending Juniper, arguing (in remarks that also have implications for peers) bad news has been priced in and that telecom capex is likely to improve in 2015. Bulls have argued Web/mobile traffic growth and SDN/NFV investments will ultimately boost capex, in spite of industry service revenue pressures.The Nasdaq as a whole is down 1.2%.

EPS guidance is now at $0.34-$0.36, down from a prior $0.35-$0.40 and below a $0.38 consensus.Not surprisingly (given both Juniper's Q2 CC remarks and industry trends), the company blames "lower-than-anticipated demand from service providers, particularly in the U.S." Juniper's recent selloff appears to be limiting the AH damage.Full Q3 results arrive on Oct. 23.

Alcatel, Ciena, others slump as telecom capex worries persist
Alcatel-Lucent (ALU -9%) is headlining a group of telecom equipment vendors selling off this morning, as worries about weak telecom capex remain following plenty of bad earnings news. Alcatel's declines come in spite of an upgrade to Buy from Craig-Hallum.Morgan Stanley has cut its Q3 and Q4 Juniper (JNPR -1%) estimates due to expectations of weak AT&T capex. Jefferies reported in June AT&T had slashed its wireline capex, and Ciena (CIEN -3.7%) stated in September AT&T was responsible for its soft Oct. quarter guidance.Ma Bell has slashed wireline capex ahead of the full launch of its huge Domain 2.0 SDN/NFV initiative. However, like Ciena, Morgan Stanley asserts Domain 2.0 remains a long-term positive for spending. MKM has argued it's a positive for Ciena and several other firms, but a negative for Cisco given a loss of vendor lock-in.Yesterday, BofA/Merrill launched coverage on Alcatel with a Neutral rating, and expressed concerns about the company's ability to hit 2015 revenue estimates amid a weak demand environment. Two weeks ago, Dell'Oro forecast global telecom capex will fall 2% in 2015 due to slowing mobile revenue growth.Bulls argue a lot of bad news is priced in, and the strong Web/mobile traffic growth will provide a lift to capex.Other decliners: ERIC -2.6%.

Cisco slumps in spite of target hikes; peers also off
Six firms have hiked their Cisco (CSCO -2.8%) targets after the company beat FQ4 estimates, issued mixed FQ1 guidance, and announced plans to cut another 6K jobs. But that isn't stopping shares from selling off due to worries about weak demand from carriers (orders -11% Y/Y) and emerging markets (orders -9%)."Notwithstanding the fact that capex will be fairly weak in [2H14], Cisco's [carrier] order performance in the first calendar half of 2014 demonstrates meaningful share loss in addition to soft carrier spending," says MKM (Neutral).Nonetheless, the firm thinks Cisco's total orders will rise at or near a low double-digit % in FQ1 (favorable comps will help). "We still believe it is profitable to own Cisco when orders and revenue growth are accelerating."Bulls are focusing on healthy enterprise orders and strong early uptake for the Nexus 9000/ACI SDN and networking virtualization platform. John Chambers mentioned on the CC (transcript) the platform's customer count more than tripled in FQ4 to 580+, and that there are over 60 customers for the related APIC software controller (just launched).Several peers and suppliers with strong carrier exposure are selling off. Cisco's numbers follow a soft outlook from JDS Uniphase, and coincide with light guidance from Oclaro. ALU -1.6%. JNPR -1.8%. FN -7.4%. ZHNE -2.1%.

Cisco, Ciena, others fall due to Juniper's guidance
Juniper's (JNPR -9.8%) soft Q3 guidance, along with its related commentary on U.S. telco demand, is taking a toll on fellow telecom equipment suppliers Cisco (CSCO -1.2%), Ciena (CIEN -3.2%), Cyan (CYNI -2.5%), Zhone (ZHNE -6.5%) Ruckus (RKUS -1.6%), and Sonus (SONS -3.8%).Optical component vendors JDS Uniphase (JDSU -2.9%) and Finisar (FNSR -2%) are also off, as are several chipmakers (previous) with heavy networking/telecom exposure.On its CC (transcript), Juniper stated "market dynamics including M&A activity" are affecting the "sequencing and timing" of U.S. carrier projects. Jefferies reported in June AT&T has significantly cut its wireline capex in the wake of the DirecTV deal.There has been speculation AT&T is keeping a lid on wireline capex ahead of the full rollout of its ambitious Domain 2.0 initiative, which will feature the launch of software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV) platforms.Juniper insists it remains well-positioned with the aforementioned U.S. carriers, and that it has "major design wins" for next-gen projects. The company adds demand remains healthy with U.S. federal, cable, and Internet clients.The company's router revenue rose 7% Y/Y in Q2 to $617.8M, and its switch revenue rose 25% to $199.8M. Security product revenue fell 8% to $111.6M. The Junos Pulse VPN software ops (about to be sold for $250M) contributed $31.4M in revenue ($15.9M product, $15.5M service).

Juniper lower on Mizuho downgrade
Mizuho has downgraded Juniper (JNPR -2.6%) to Neutral, and cut its PT by $6 to $26.

Telecom hardware stocks slide on AT&T capex report
Jefferies reports AT&T (T -0.1%) significantly cut its wireline capex starting last month.It thinks many companies could be affected, including equipment vendors Alcatel-Lucent (ALU -2.2%), Ciena (CIEN -3.9%), Juniper (JNPR +0.2%), and Adtran (ADTN -5.1%), and component vendors JDS Uniphase (JDSU -2%) and Finisar (FNSR -0.7%).As its is, AT&T's 2014 capex budget ($21B) is down $200M from 2013's spending level. Moreover, the carrier's huge mobile infrastructure needs and the DirecTV deal could be motivating it to cut wireline spend.Also: AT&T may be looking to keep capex down ahead of the full rollout of Domain 2.0, an initiative meant to improve network flexibility, lower costs, and cut provisioning times through the embrace of software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV).MKM has argued Domain 2.0 will be a negative for Cisco, but a positive for Ciena and Finisar, among others.

Juniper (JNPR) expects Q2 revenue of $1.2B-$1.23B and EPS of $0.36-$0.39 vs. a consensus of $1.21B and $0.36. Gross margin is expected to be in a range of 63.5%-64.5% vs. 63.7% a year ago.Juniper's aggressive buybacks should boost Q2 EPS: The company delivered $900M worth of shares in Q1 for its $1.2B ASR, and has promised to buy back over $2B worth of shares by Q1 2015.Product revenue +12% Y/Y in Q1 to $876M, service revenue +6% to $294.1M. Routing sales rose 7% to $549.8M (share gains against Cisco), and switch sales jumped 47% to $192M.Security sales fell 2% to $134.2M, but that's a smaller decline than seen in recent quarters.

Barclays: CIO survey data positive for H-P, Juniper, F5, others
An April Barclays survey of 100 U.S. and European CIOs found 46% expecting their company's IT spending to rise in 1H14, 20% expecting it to drop, and 34% expecting no change. Those figures compare with September survey levels of 43%, 27%, and 30%.Moreover, IT spending growth is seen accelerating in 2H in both the U.S. and Europe. Barclays thinks larger budgets, macro stabilization, and a need for equipment refreshes (due to high utilization rates) could be helping out.At the same time, the firm cautions the spending growth is uneven: Software, networking, security, and cloud services demand is healthy, but servers, storage, and IT services remain soft. Interest in the concept of a software-defined data center is gaining traction, but big data (hyped considerably last year) is losing it for now.Gartner has forecast IT spending will rise 3.2% this year to $3.77T after growing just 0.4% in 2013. Enterprise software (+6.9% to $320B) is expected to lead the way.Barclays thinks its survey bodes well for H-P (HPQ), Juniper (JNPR), F5 (FFIV), Aruba (ARUN), Ingram Micro (IM), and CDW, each of which is rated Overweight.Others that might take heart in the survey results: CSCO, ORCL, SAP, CA, SWI, VMW, CHKP, BRCD, ARW, AVT Apr. 14, 2014, 7:07 PM | 1 Comment
Cisco, Juniper find "Heartbleed" security hole in products
Cisco (CSCO) and Juniper Networks (JNPR) have found the "Heartbleed" encryption flaw in some of their products, including routers, switches, servers, and firewalls.The ubiquitous nature of the products makes the bug harder to eliminate, and hackers may be able to steal sensitive data such as passwords and credit-card information as it travels across networks.Cisco is investigating 65 products and has confirmed 16 as being vulnerable.Juniper's VP of Corporate Communications, Michael Busselen, said the exposure for customers "is minimal," as the problem affected only one product. However, spokesman Corey Olfert warned that updating Juniper equipment could take a while. "It doesn't sound like a flip the switch sort of thing," said Olfert. "I don't know how quickly they can be resolved."Meanwhile, Intel (INTC) was still working on a patch for its McAfee security products as of yesterday.Vulnerable Cisco products.

Juniper laying off 6% of workforce, abandoning Riverbed's ADC tech
Juniper's (JNPR) job cut disclosure comes five weeks after new CEO Shaygan Kheradpar unveiled (with Elliott Management's blessing) an "Integrated Operating Plan" that calls for $160M/year in opex savings by Q1 2015, and a 580 bps improvement in op. margin from 2013 to 2015.Juniper, which has ~9.5K employees, expects to record $35M worth of charges in Q1. The company also expects to record $70M worth of charges (starting in Q2) related to plans to dispose of 300K sq. feet of leased facilities, and $20M worth of other charges later this year.Product development related to the application delivery controller (ADC) technology Juniper licensed from Riverbed (RVBD) for $75M in 2012 is coming to an end. Juniper expects to record an $85M Q1 non-cash charge related to the move.Juniper's decision removes one more potential rival for ADC leader F5 (FFIV).

Palo Alto Networks (PANW +10.9%) is within striking distance of its post-IPO high of $79.99 after a mistrial was declared for rival Juniper's (JNPR -0.6%) infringement suit against the company. The judge presiding over the suit has instructed lawyers from both parties to meet to determine their next moves.FBR calls the decision a big "sigh of relief" for Palo Alto investors. Ahead of the mistrial announcement, Citi was already arguing the odds of a settlement had grown, given a judge's ruling that no second trial covering indirect infringement would occur.Citi even thinks a cross-selling deal between Palo and Juniper is possible, given Juniper's recent struggles in the branch office firewall market.Palo Alto's official statement Mar. 7, 2014, 4:34 PM | 16 Comments

Juniper strikes board deal with Elliott. Nokia exec downplays merger talk.
Activist investor Elliott Management (6.2% stake) has reached a deal with Juniper (JNPR) under which Juniper will nominate telecom industry vet Kevin DeNuccio (now the CEO of Violin Memory) and ex-Nortel COO Gary Daichendt to its board, and won't nominate more than 7 incumbent directors at its annual meeting.

Juniper unveils dividend, $2B+ in buybacks, $160M/year in cost cuts
As promised, Juniper (JNPR) and new CEO Shaygan Kheradpir have rolled out an "Integrated Operating Plan" that checks off many items on Elliott Management and Jana Partners' wish lists.Juniper will initiate a $0.10/share dividend in Q3 (current yield of 1.4%), and says it intends to grow its payout over time. The company also promises to spend $2B+ on buybacks through Q1 2015, and to create a new "One-Juniper" corporate structure that will yield $160M/year in opex savings by Q1 2015, and a 2015 op. margin of 25% (up 580 bps from 2013).The company adds Kheradpir wants Juniper to "focus on the fastest growing networking segments." Details are light for now, but the comments could suggest lower investments in slow-growing security and corporate Ethernet switch markets where Juniper has struggled. McKinsey has been hired to help with Juniper's restructuring.As part of buyback efforts, Juniper plans to enter into a $1.2B accelerated share repurchase agreement.

Cisco expectations subdued going into earnings
With shares having badly underperformed the Nasdaq since August due to earnings disappointments (I, II), expectations for Cisco (CSCO +0.4%) are fairly low going into today's FQ2 report. Thanks to emerging markets, set-top, and carrier router weakness, analysts collectively forecast Cisco will see an 8.8% Y/Y revenue drop in FQ2, and a 7.1% drop in FQ3.Stifel's checks indicate Juniper (JNPR - Q4 service provider sales +12% Y/Y) is taking carrier router share from Cisco. The firm is also worried many Cisco customers are holding off on data center switch purchases as they evaluate its new Insieme/ACI SDN platform.Insieme has received a mixed early reception, with some praising its innovative (software-driven) feature set and others deeming too costly/complex relative to SDN/networking virtualization alternatives that can leverage commodity hardware. VMware's (VMW) NSX platform is arguably its biggest rival on this front.Though admitting Cisco faces a slew of near-term challenges, Cantor remains upbeat about the potential of new products, including Insieme/ACI and Cisco's NCS carrier routers, to provide a lift in FY15 (ends July '15).UBS, while reiterating a Buy, thinks a long-term battle for data center supremacy is getting underway between Cisco and VMware, one whose outcome is far from certain.

In his company's Q4 report, new Juniper (JNPR) CEO Shaygan Kheradpir says one of his first priorities is to "develop an Integrated Operating Plan" that that will feature "an improved cost structure," a "more focused strategy on innovation that matters," and a new capital allocation strategy that "results in improved returns." Details will be provided in the next few weeks.Kheradpir's remarks, which could be a hint that Juniper is about to cut R&D spend and make a dividend/buyback announcement, comes ten days after Elliott Management disclosed a 6.2% stake and called for such moves.Juniper's R&D spend fell 6% Y/Y in Q4, but still accounted for 20% of revenue.

Cisco still largest security hardware firm; Fortinet, Palo Alto gain share
Compared with servers and storage systems, demand for security hardware remains quite healthy. IDC estimates security appliance sales rose 6.5% Y/Y in Q3 to $2.2B, even as units only rose 0.3% (indicates higher ASPs). Sales had risen 6.1% in Q2 in spite of a 1.5% shipment drop.IDC thinks Cisco (CSCO), which just acquired leading intrusion prevention system (IPS) vendor SourceFire, had a 15.9% industry share, down fractionally Y/Y. #2 Check Point (CHKP) is given a 12.4% share (-30 bps), and #3 Fortinet (FTNT) a 6.4% share (+50 bps).#4 Juniper (JNPR), whose security unit has been a weak spot and is now under new management, saw its share fall 170 bps to 6.2%. Meanwhile, fast-growing next-gen firewall vendor Palo Alto Networks (PANW) saw its share rise 140 bps to 5.3%.In spite of healthy industry growth, the firewall market (21% of industry revenue), which Cisco, Juniper, and Check Point are well-exposed to, saw a 15% Y/Y sales drop. On the other hand, the unified threat management (UTM) market, which Fortinet is a leader in, grew 29%, and the IPS market grew 8%. Dec. 18, 2013, 7:13 PM

Cisco (CSCO -2.3%) is now targeting annual revenue growth of 3%-6% over the next 3-5 years, down from a prior 5%-7%, says CFO Frank Calderoni states at the networking giant's analyst meeting. In addition, Calderoni says Cisco's FY14 (ends July '14) revenue growth outlook is "basically" in-line with a Street forecast for a 4% decline.Cisco is now aiming for services revenue growth of 7%-10% over the next 3-5 years, down from 9%-11%; services accounted for 22% of Cisco's Oct. quarter revenue. Businesses related to "enabling the cloud" (a somewhat nebulous term) are expected to show a 12%-18% growth rate.Cisco, already pressured by John Chambers' macro comments, continues to trade lower. Many networking equipment peers and component/chip suppliers are also selling off; in addition to Cisco, Ciena's mixed FQ4 results and slightly soft FQ1 guidance could be playing a role here.Notable networking equipment/component/chip decliners: JNPR -3.1%.

Cantor's Brian White, best known for singing Apple's praises,  is reiterating a Buy and $26 PT on Juniper (JNPR +2.3%), while arguing sentiment is "hovering near five-year lows."White also argues Juniper should "accelerate its stock buyback program or initiate a cash dividend." The networking/security hardware vendor spent $93M on buybacks in Q3, but with $4B in cash/investments on its balance sheet (partly offset by $1B in debt), Juniper could afford to spend more.With security-related weakness weighing on its results, Juniper has missed out on this year's tech rally, and remains well below its early 2011 highs. Shares trade at just slightly over 10x 2014E EPS after backing out net cash/investments. Nov. 20, 2013, 1:32 PM
Palo Alto closes up sharply as Juniper hearing takes place
Palo Alto (PANW +8.5%) shares surged into the close on a day when a major hearing took place for Juniper's (JNPR +2.2%) patent suit against its share-gaining firewall rival. Attorney/trader Daniel B. Ravicher, who attended the hearing, suggests the proceedings went in Palo Alto's favor, with the judge presiding over the dispute questioning the breadth of Juniper's patent claims.As SA contributor Markman Advisors has covered in detail, today's hearing relates to claim construction - the court rules on the scope of Juniper's infringement claims for six patents - as well as Juniper's request for a summary judgment of infringement for multiple patents.Palo Alto investors have been nervous for a while about the Juniper suit, which is related to IP Palo Alto's founders developed while working at Juniper-acquired NetScreen.Cowen has argued Markman filings leave Juniper well-positioned. Goldman thinks the amount of lawsuit-related "overhang" that has been priced into Palo Alto's shares runs well into ten figures.Palo Alto filed a countersuit against Juniper in September.

Tech giants feel impact of U.S. spying scandal
Cisco's (CSCO) FQ1 results earlier this week highlight how major tech firms are feeling the impact of a backlash in China to Edward Snowden's revelations about U.S. spying."All the big U.S. IT companies are concerned," says Jim Lewis, a China and technology expert at the Center for Strategic Studies in Washington.Cisco has been the most explicit about attributing the Snowden effect to its falling sales in China; Beijing could be specifically targeting the company due to American hostility to telecom-equipment makers Huawei Technologies and ZTE (ZTCOY) over fears that their products could be used for espionage.However, Juniper's (JNPR) experience is that the "The Snowden effect is not real," adding that business in China continues to grow.Other companies to suffer in the country recently include IBM (IBM) and Microsoft (MSFT), with the reasons cited including macro-economic factors. IBM might be somewhat inured to the NSA affair, as some of its high-end products face less competition than Cisco's offerings. Nov. 15, 2013, 4:41 AM | 5 Comments
Cisco offers poor guidance, shares tumble
Cisco (CSCO) guides on its FQ1 CC for FQ2 revenue to decline 8%-10% Y/Y, and EPS of $0.45-$0.47. That's well below a consensus for a 4.1% revenue increase and EPS of $0.52. The networking giant is also guiding for FY14 (ends July '14) EPS of $1.95-$2.05, below a $2.10 consensus.Orders fell 4% Y/Y in FQ1 after growing 4% in FQ4. The two biggest culprits: Service provider orders fell 13%, and emerging markets orders fell 12% (India and China -18% each). The company isn't currently expecting order improvement in FQ2.Service provider weakness is blamed on soft carrier spending, declining set-top sales (attributed to product shifts and an effort to move away from low-margin deals), core router product transitions, and low-end edge router share loss (likely to Juniper).Also: Cisco estimates the government shutdown impacted FQ1 U.S. federal sales by $50M, and the political environment in China is said to remain "challenging."CSCO now -9.8% AH. Also off: JNPR -2.8%. FNSR -1.3%. More names could sell off in time. Nov. 13, 2013, 5:13 PM | 38 Comments
Juniper names former Verizon CIO/CTO its next CEO
Shaygan Kheradpir, currently Barclays' chief operations and technology officer and once Verizon's chief information and technology officer, will become Juniper's (JNPR -1.5%) CEO on Jan. 1. He replaces Kevin Johnson, who announced in July he would retire once a successor is found. Johnson will remain on Juniper's board. (PR)Kheradpir will take over a company that's seeing solid carrier demand for its edge/core routers, but also has a struggling security hardware business (once reportedly on the block) and faces intense competition in the enterprise switch/router space. Nov. 13, 2013, 10:33 AM
Cisco up strongly ahead of Insieme launch
Cisco (CSCO +2.3%) is rallying ahead of tomorrow's anticipated Insieme event. Insieme, an 85%-owned Cisco unit filled with star engineers, is expected to show off a networking platform featuring switches that can dynamically adapt to an application's needs, and which will deliver network and security services to said apps. It's also expected to reveal high-performance, ASIC-based, switches supporting its platform, and developer APIs for interacting with them.Though Cisco has shied away from referring to Insieme's solution as a software-defined networking (SDN) platform, it's viewed as part of Cisco's response to the rise of SDN solutions featuring software-based controllers that can interact with commodity hardware, and which are seen as a huge threat to Cisco's high-margin switch/router sales.Cisco exec Frank D'Agostino: "We don’t want the application to be network aware; we want the network to be application aware." Cisco argues the latter approach will provide superior performance and network visibility; of course, it might also make it easier for the company to defend its high margins.Rivals have been making announcements ahead of the Insieme event. Juniper (JNPR +0.5%), which previously launched an opens-source SDN controller, has unveiled its MetaFabric architecture, which allows the company's data center switches and edge routers to be jointly managed and programmed across multiple locations. Meanwhile, high-density switch vendor Arista, which might soon be doing an IPO, has launched new switches that offer improved programmability. Nov. 5, 2013, 3:46 PM
Juniper adds to post-earnings losses, peers also off
The soft Q4 top-line guidance provided with Juniper's (JNPR -5.9%) Q3 beat has led shares to fall below $20. Several peers are also off on a down day for tech: FFIV -4.3% (reporting after the close). DRWI -3.9%. PKT -2.8%. RKUS -2.6%. CIEN -2.4%. RVBD -2.2%.On its CC, Juniper attributed its guidance to U.S. federal weakness caused in part by the government shutdown, and called the macro environment "dynamic." The company also disclosed it's cutting another 280 jobs (~3% of its workforce) in Q4, and that it's in the "later stages" of its search for a replacement for departing CEO Kevin Johnson.Some of the job cuts are related to Juniper's decision to kill off its MobileNext 3G/4G infrastructure software line.The sell-side is nervous about declining enterprise sales, caused in large part by security share losses. Juniper promises a resumption of security growth in 2014; favorable comps should make that easier.Carrier routers continue to be a bright spot: MX series edge router sales rose  15% Q/Q, and core router sales 11% Q/Q. Both Cisco and Juniper have been seeing strong edge router demand in recent quarters.Juniper also states it's seeing healthy carrier demand in all three major geographies. However, Americas demand is generally stronger than EMEA and Asia-Pac demand. Oct. 23, 2013, 2:23 PM
Juniper's top-line guidance a little soft; shares -1.8% AH
Juniper (JNPR) expects Q4 revenue of $1.2B-$1.23B and EPS of $0.35-$0.37 vs. a consensus of $1.23B and $0.36.Q3 results beat estimates on the back of a 12% Y/Y increase in service provider revenue (Q2 growth was also 12%). However, enterprise sales fell 4% Y/Y after rising 8% in Q2. Service provider sales made up 66% of revenue, and enterprise 34%.A big reason for the enterprise drop: security sales fell 18% Y/Y to $144.3M, thanks to continued share losses to both incumbents Cisco and Check Point, and upstarts such as Palo Alto Networks (currently being sued by Juniper), Fortinet, and F5.Owing to strong carrier demand for Juniper's edge and core routers, router sales rose 18% to $608.9M. Switch sales rose 1% to $147.6M.Americas sales (56% of total) rose 18%, likely a sign of strong demand from mainstay customers AT&T/Verizon. EMEA sales -5%, Asia-Pac -8%.Excluding restructuring charges, opex fell 1% Y/Y. $93M was spent on buybacks.Q3 results, PR Oct. 22, 2013, 5:47 PM

More on MKM's Cisco downgrade and Juniper upgrade
MKM's Michael Genovese, who downgraded Cisco (CSCO -0.6%) to Neutral this morning, says checks indicate the emerging markets weakness the networking giant saw in FQ4 (the July quarter) has continued in FQ1, and that the government shutdown (now set to end) has hurt U.S. enterprise spending.Genovese notes Cisco "tends to outperform when the y/y product order rate is accelerating," and notes this isn't the case following FQ4. Shares are up 23% since he upgraded Cisco to Buy a year ago.At the same time, Genovese thinks rival Juniper (JNPR +4.1%), which has been upgraded to Buy, is about to see accelerating growth for its carrier ops (65% of revenue) thanks to improving core router/switch growth (as indicated by checks) and share gains for newer products such as the T4000 and PTX core router lines.Cisco recently launched its NCS core router line to take on the PTX in a growing market for core routers that have more flexibility to handle diverse traffic loads than traditional hardware.Juniper's service provider sales rose 7% Y/Y in Q2; enterprise sales rose 8%.

Palo Alto returns fire in patent battle against Juniper
Palo Alto Networks (PANW) discloses it has filed suit against Juniper (JNPR) in a Northern California district court, alleging the networking hardware vendor's products infringe 3 of its patents.Juniper sued Palo Alto back in 2011, alleging latter's next-gen firewalls infringe 6 patents developed by Palo Alto's founders when they were working for NetScreen (acquired by Juniper in '04). Juniper later added other patents to the suit, which has been weighing on Palo Alto investors' minds. A trial is set to begin in early 2014.Juniper, whose security unit has been losing ground to Palo Alto and others, has rolled out its own next-gen firewalls. There's a good chance Palo Alto's suit covers those products. Sep. 30, 2013, 5:18 PM
Cisco unveils new core routers, outlines NPU plans; EZchip takes off
At a launch event for its new NCS core router line, Cisco (CSCO -0.5%) states its recently-announced nPower X1 network processor (NPU) won't displace EZchip's (EZCH +17.1%) NPUs.EZchip shares, which tumbled when the X1 was originally announced, have shot higher. Oppenheimer had estimated the nPower X1 could hurt EZchip's top line by 20%-25% if used in future Cisco edge routers; the chipmaker issued a statement attempting to soothe investor fears.Cisco states the X1, which (per John Chambers) cost $250M to develop, will power the NCS line, as well as its mainstay CRS-X core routers.As previously reported, the NCS line is meant to provide better support for diverse traffic loads than the CRS-X line. Cisco touts the programmability of its new hardware, as well as its advanced management tools (both physical and virtual resources can be provisioned across systems) and support for the company's ONE SDN platform (will eventually cover Cisco's entire switch/router lineup).The high-end NCS 6000 supports line cards with densities up to 1Tbps; that exceeds the 400Gbps supported by the CRS-X and supports arguments the former will be viewed as a replacement for the latter, even if it isn't officially marketed as such.The NCS 6000 is already shipping, as is a complementary 100G optical transport system known as the NCS 2000. Japan's KDDI and Australia's Telstra are among the first clients. A less powerful router known as the NCS 4000 will ship in 1H14.Juniper (JNPR -1.2%), whose successful PTX Series routers are being targeted by the NCS line, is ticking lower.

Juniper challenges Cisco/VMware with open-source SDN controller
Juniper (JNPR) has launched OpenContrail, a software-defined networking (SDN) controller the company will make freely available through an open-source license. Juniper is also rebranding and announcing the general availability of a version that comes with services/support (it goes for $1,700 per CPU socket).OpenContrail, like other SDN platforms, allows users to provision and program compatible network resources, theoretically with the click of a mouse. Among other things, it can be used to create virtual networks and interact with cloud management platforms. Juniper claims its controller has been in trials with 40+ customers.The products are the fruits of Juniper's 2012 acquisition of Contrail Systems, which was well-received by investors.Juniper's strategy is very different from those of VMware (VMW) and Cisco (CSCO), each of whom are selling proprietary SDN controllers to go with higher-level software. VMware, which doesn't sell hardware, is partnering with a slew of Cisco rivals (inc. Juniper). Cisco is counting on its huge installed base to make what's largely a go-it-alone approach successful.A Juniper exec says his firm is comfortable open-sourcing its controller because it doesn't think SDN will commoditize networking hardware (some disagree). "When you put these overlays on top of the network, it’s going to drive more traffic ... Performance is still going to matter."Analyst Zeus Kerravala thinks Juniper is simply being pragmatic on account of its relatively small data center share."Historically, Juniper’s tried too hard to be Cisco, like when they build these proprietary, vertically integrated solutions. That’s fine when you’re Cisco." Sep. 16, 2013, 7:35 PM
Reports: Cisco prepping new core routers, possibly eying Big Switch
Network World reports Cisco (CSCO) is getting set to launch the NCS 6000, a core router/optical transport platform meant to smoothly handle diverse IP traffic loads (important as video and mobile accounts for a growing share of that traffic).The 6000, likely to feature a new ASIC Cisco has spent $250M developing, would go head-to-head against Juniper's (JNPR) successful PTX Series and Alcatel-Lucent's (ALU) 7950 XRS. Juniper says the PTX Series routers, which began shipping early last year, is now used by "dozens of the top 130 service providers in the world."In theory at least, the 6000 complement Cisco's more powerful but less complex CRS core router line. But one source asserts its launch will make CRS "a legacy platform." Cisco is less than 3 months removed from announcing the CRS-X, which delivers a 150% increase in capacity/slot over its predecessor.Regardless, Cisco's core router ops could definitely use a boost following a difficult July quarter that sparked concerns about share loss. The company's edge router sales are faring better.Meanwhile, SDN Central reports rumors are floating hyped software-defined networking (SDN) startup Big Switch could be acquired by Cisco for less than $100M, presumably for its talent. The company, which once poached Cisco exec Parashant Gandhi, has recently been hit by executive defections of its own (one of them to Cisco).Whereas Big Switch initially proposed to completely remake customer data centers through an SDN platform based on the OpenFlow standard, companies are now more partial to the gradual (overlay-based) approaches pushed by Cisco, VMware, and others.

Juniper surges on upbeat CEO comments; peers also up
At a Citi conference (webcast), departing CEO Kevin Johnson stated Juniper's (JNPR +5.5%) Q3 bookings are tracking above expectations, and that router demand is healthy.Routing rivals Cisco (CSCO +1.5%) and Alcatel-Lucent (ALU +4.7%) appear to be getting a lift from the remarks, and from Ciena's FQ3 beat and FQ4 guidance. In Alcatel's case, M&A hopes fueled by Microsoft/Nokia might also be a trigger.Thanks in part to strong MX Series edge router sales, Juniper's routing revenue rose 14% Y/Y in Q2, offsetting declining security revenue (share loss) and accounting for half of total revenue. Cisco reported strong edge router sales for the July quarter, but total routing revenue was flat thanks to core router weakness (possible due to share loss to Juniper/Alcatel).Alcatel's IP division (switches/routers) has been a strong point, growing 21% Y/Y in Q2. The company entered the core router market last year via its 7950 XRS line; a PR mudslinging battle with Cisco began shortly afterwards. Sep. 4, 2013, 11:41 AM
Juniper killing off MobileNext software line
MobileNext, previously touted by analysts as a growth opportunity, works in tandem with Juniper's (JNPR) MX series edge routers to create a gateway/management system standing between 3G/4G mobile networks and wireline networks.The platform, launched in 2011 as part of Juniper's Project Falcon mobile initiative, struggled to compete against Cisco's (CSCO) ASR 5000 gateway (a product of the Starent acquisition). Juniper says it will still target the mobile market via the MX series, SRX series security appliances, and the JunosV App Engine.In spite of MobileNext's struggles, Juniper's MX series sales rose 19% Q/Q and 43% Y/Y in Q2. Likewise, Cisco reported strong July quarter sales for its ASR 9000 edge router line. Aug. 28, 2013, 5:54 PM
VMware announces new networking platform, Cisco rivals on board
VMware's (VMW -0.6%) VMworld product announcements have commenced. The most noteworthy is the introduction of VMware NSX, a management/virtualization platform that combines Nicira's software-defined networking (SDN) platform with the networking/security tools found in VMware's vCloud Suite (they allow virtual networking appliances to be set up). NSX is integrated with VMware's vSphere virtualization platform.NSX allows VMware to offer a common platform for managing/configuring physical switches, virtual appliances, and the services delivered over them. It amounts to a fresh shot across VMware partner Cisco's (CSCO +0.4%) bow, since it shifts network intelligence away from Cisco's switches and related management tools, and could make it easier to replace Cisco hardware with commodity gear.Cisco, which sold off when VMware's purchase of Nicira was announced, is attempting to counter VMware and other SDN players through its proprietary ONE SDN controller and related onePK API, both of which are set to be supported by the company's entire switch/router lineup.Brocade (BRCD -0.8%) Vyatta virtual router unit has also been targeting the virtual appliance market.Juniper (JNPR -0.2%), which is taking a more collaborative approach to SDN than Cisco (likely due to its smaller market position), plans to have its switches support NSX. Dell, H-P, and startup Arista are also on board.Many of the initial hardware supporters are relying on Broadcom's (BRCM -0.6%) Trident II network processor. The chipmaker has long viewed SDN (thanks to its enabling of commodity switch use) as a growth opportunity.Early users of NSX include Citi, eBay, and GE. Aug. 26, 2013, 1:49 PM

EZchip (EZCH +4.6%) rallies after Chardan Capital upgrades shares to Buy. The firm is encouraged by Juniper's (JNPR +1.1%) Q2 CC remarks about strong edge router/carrier Ethernet demand. Juniper: "What we're seeing now on the Edge is it's now building out new capacity to handle what was networks that were running hotter and hotter. And we think that, that trend is going to continue for several quarters ... and we're just now starting to see the signs that investment will ... start to kick in for the core." Juniper only makes up 13% of EZchip's sales, but Chardan thinks Cisco (32% of sales) and ZTE (27%) could be seeing similar trends. EZchip's Q2 results arrive on Aug. 7.

Cisco (CSCO +0.3%) is delivering an evolutionary upgrade for its costly CRS core router line. The upgraded routers, named CRS-X, will deliver a 150% increase in capacity/slot, and support 4 100G ports/slot with the help of Cisco's CPAK silicon photonics tech. Cisco also claims the CRS-X will support 64 100G ports per 7' rack, and that this beats the 40 offered by Alcatel-Lucent's (ALU) 7950 router and the 32 by Juniper's (JNPR) T4000; but Alcatel claims to have reached 80. Light Reading recently reported Cisco is prepping a next-gen core routing platform called CTR that (based on reported info) would deliver a 150% capacity/slot increase from the CRS-X.

Ciena sacrificed margins a bit - while revenue rose 12% Q/Q, gross margin fell 210 bps to 42.5% - but given the size of its revenue beat, investors don't mind. Sales of integrated Ethernet/optical networking hardware (Ciena is a leader here and recently announced a refresh) +10% Y/Y and 57% of revenue. Ethernet switches +91% and now 11% of revenue; optical networking -32%, software/services +3%. Two customers (AT&T/Verizon?) made up 31% of sales. INFN +6.7%. JDSU +5.1%. FNSR +5.9%. JNPR +2.5%. ALU +4.2%. SONS +3.8%. (PR)

Juniper (JNPR +5.6%) spikes higher after CEO Kevin Johnson states at a BofA/Merrill conference his company is seeing a pickup in carrier router spend. Though Juniper's enterprise security ops struggled in Q1, its service provider sales grew 4% Y/Y, thanks in large part to healthy core/edge router demand. Market leader Cisco (CSCO +0.9%) has moved higher in sympathy.

Cisco (CSCO) is prepping a successor to its costly/high-margin CRS-3 core router that will be called the CTR and offer up to 1Tb/s of capacity per slot, according to a document ontained by Light Reading. That figure represents a solid increase from the CRS-3's 400Gb/s per slot, and is also above the 800Gb/s delivered by Alcatel-Lucent's (ALU) 7950 core router, launched last year to much fanfare and PR mudslinging. Juniper's (JNPR) T4000 is at 240Gb/s per slot. The CTR is also said to support Cisco's CPAK silicon photonics modules, which some analysts (though not all) view as a threat to JDS Uniphase (JDSU) and Finisar (FNSR).

Sonus (SONS +5.4%) jumps after announcing a hardware/software partnership with Juniper (JNPR +1.1%) that covers the networking industry's favorite buzzphrase, software-defined networking. Sonus' 5000 series VoIP session border controllers (SBCs) will be paired with Juniper's MX Series edge routers and SRC Policy Engine software to give carriers the ability to offertiered IP video and unified communications services, as well as more efficiently use network capacity. The announcement comes a couple weeks after Sonus, which competes with Oracle-owned Acme Packet in the SBC market, refreshed the 5000 series to include more modular systems.

A few Cisco rivals and suppliers are up premarket after the networking giant beat estimates while reporting strong data center switch/server sales and service provider orders (albeit while cautioning the SP capex environment remains tough). Some others might move higher following the open. JNPR +3.6%. FFIV +3.2%. CIEN +3.9%. EZCH +1.2% - Cisco mentioned on its earnings call sales of its ASR 9000 edge routers, which EZchip supplies network processors for, were up 40%+ Y/Y.

IDC cuts its 2013 IT spending growth forecast to 4.9% from 5.5%, citing macro issues and weak PC demand; 2012 growth was 5.6%. Gartner, which includes a bigger array of products/services in its numbers, forecast 4.1% growth last month. IDC now sees U.S. software spending (MSFT, ORCL) growing 6%, down from a prior 7%. Storage hardware revenue (EMC, NTAP) is only expected to grow 2.4%, down from 2012's 6.1%, and carrier spending on networking gear (CSCO, JNPR, ALU, CIEN) is expected to grow just 1.1% vs. 5.8% in 2012. Recent earnings reports and warnings (I, II, III, IV) help explain the subdued outlook. May 15, 2013, 1:23 AM | 2 Comments
FBR has upgraded Cisco (CSCO +0.3%) to Market Perform ahead of Wednesday's FQ3 report. Less than 2 months after downgrading Cisco and Juniper (JNPR -0.5%) on a belief software-defined networking (SDN) will drastically lower switch/router demand, the firm says talks suggest SDN overlay solutions - Cisco, Juniper, and VMware (VMW) are pushing them - are gaining traction relative to products requiring big hardware changes, and that this should limit near-term sales pressure. Though rivals doubtlessly disagree, Cisco has been arguing its SDN solution can offer superior intelligence, thanks to its integration with Cisco hardware.

Prashant Gandhi, the head of project management for Cisco's (CSCO) software-defined networking (SDN) efforts, has left to join SDN startup Big Switch, which in March unveiled an open standards-based SDN solution declared an alternative to Cisco and VMware/Nicira's more proprietary offerings. Gandhi helped develop Cisco's ONE SDN controller. Tom Black, another key member of Cisco's SDN team, left last October for startup Arista. Meanwhile, leveraging the Contrail Systems acquisition, Juniper (JNPR) today unveiled an SDN controller that the company promises won't require major hardware changes; will this affect flexibility?

Juniper (JNPR -9.7%) hits levels last seen in July '12 thanks to disappointing results and guidance, and perhaps also AT&T's capex cuts. A 19% Q/Q and Y/Y Q1 sales drop for Juniper's security hardware ops, which have been losing share and are rumored to be on the block, is of particular concern to Stifel. "The company continues to struggle in its campus and branch office security portfolio and needs a focused strategy." Security weakness led enterprise sales to be roughly flat Y/Y. Service provider sales rose 4%, driven by core/edge router demand from U.S. telcos. Americas sales +11%, but EMEA -5% and Asia-Pac -9%. (transcript)

A downgrade to Equalweight from Barclays is contributing to Juniper's (JNPR -5.3%) post-F5 losses. The downgrade comes a day after Juniper announced its highly programmable EX9200 data center switch, which (like the Contrail Systems deal) drives home a software-defined networking strategy of emphasizing interoperability with 3rd-party offerings (in contrast to Cisco's more proprietary approach). Juniper asserts the EX9200, which uses a home-grown ASIC, is "designed to support all known protocols today and all unknown protocols for the next decade." Apr. 5, 2013, 11:40 AM

Juniper (JNPR -1.5%), Allot (ALLT -1.4%), Procera (PKT -1.9%), and BroadSoft (BSFT -0.1%) close lower after Pac Crest's Brent Bracelin cuts his estimates, citing European macro concerns. Though Pac Crest's research suggests the world's 15 biggest carriers (outside of China) could increase capex by 10% this year, it also indicates over half of the growth is expected to come from European carriers, and "there still appears to be a gap between talk and placing orders." Bracelin sees Cisco (CSCO - only 30% of revenue from carriers) as relatively insulated. (previous)

Following the lead of VMware's (VMW) Nicira unit, startup Big Switch Networks is rolling out a software-defined networking (SDN) platform it argues will cut dependence on proprietary switches from the likes of Cisco (CSCO) and Juniper (JNPR). Big Switch's platform, called Switch Light, can be used either with commodity switches running on BRCM chips, or "virtual" switches running Linux (BRCD has ambitions here). Unlike Nicira, which only partly leverages the OpenFlow SDN standard, Big Switch is fully throwing its weight behind OpenFlow, and is offering an open-source version of Switch Light to drive its adoption.

More on FBR's downgrades of Cisco (CSCO -3.5%) and Juniper (JNPR -3.3%): the firm sees the adoption of software-defined networking (SDN) leading to a 40% reduction in switch/router ports deployed by service providers/large enterprises over the next 18-36 months. Though SDN can improve network efficiency, that forecast is more aggressive than most. Also, like others, FBR sees SDN adoption driving sales of commodity, low-margin switches at the expense of Cisco/Juniper's proprietary gear. Cisco is trying to respond to the threat with an SDN platform that requires plenty of software licenses. (Juniper's strategy)

A harsh downgrade to Sell from Goldman sends Juniper (JNPR -4.5%) lower. The firm is worried about share loss and margin pressure in the carrier router space (42% of 2013E sales) thanks to Alcatel-Lucent's (ALU) 2012 arrival, sees Juniper's switching share flattening thanks to Cisco's Nexus 6000 launch and the impact of software-defined networking, and expects "continued share loss" in security hardware thanks to "product feature gaps and the cannibalistic effect on sales from the transition to a software model." 2013-2015 estimates have been lowered.

Juniper (JNPR) has jumped on board the 100G optical bandwagon: a line card containing two 100G links has been introduced for Juniper's PTX switches, which combine optical and data networking capabilities in the same box. Among the systems the line card works with is the new PTX3000, which delivers twice the density of the older PTX5000. In the wake of the announcement, Light Reading thinks Juniper, still best-known in the carrier realm for its routers, has a "very strong claim on being an optical company."

Juniper (JNPR -1.5%) is reviewing options for its enterprise networking ops following failed attempts to sell some of its assets, Reuters reports. Among the assets reportedly put on the block was Juniper's NetScreen security hardware unit, which has been bleeding share to upstarts. Juniper is now said to be eying acquisitions (potentially financed via private stock sales), albeit "with a longer-term view of a sale or spin-off." Juniper's enterprise sales fell 10% Y/Y in Q4, while its service provider sales rose 9%. (EMC rumor)

Juniper (JNPR +3.9%) is higher as the Street decides a Q4 beat and in-line Q1 EPS guidance is good enough, even if revenue guidance is light. Also, product revenue was flat Y/Y after falling 3% in Q3, and op. margin rose 130 bps Q/Q to 18.2% thanks to job cuts. Enterprise sales fell 10% Y/Y (share loss, esp. in security), but service provider sales (65% of total) rose 9%, fueled by demand for MX Series edge routers and PTX Series Ethernet switches.

To the chagrin of telecom equipment firms, Verizon (VZ +0.9%) is staying frugal with its capex: after spending $16.2B in 2012 (down slightly Y/Y in spite of a 4.5% revenue gain), the carrier forecasts 2013 capex will be flat Y/Y. Big Red also says it wants to lower wireless expenses by $2B, and forecasts a 2013 wireless EBITDA margin of 49%-50% (up from 2012's 46.6%). Lower smartphone subsidies are a goal (possibly bad news for Apple and Samsung), and stock buybacks aren't ruled out - a heavy debt load and cash distributions to Vodafone limit Verizon's flexibility here.

In addition to downgrading Cisco, JPMorgan is upgrading (I, II) Juniper (JNPR +3.3%) and Infinera (INFN +6.6%) to Overweight. The firm sees improving 2013 carrier capex, new routers, stock buybacks, and "a proactive focus on operating leverage" aiding Juniper, which is about to partly upend its business model in an effort to embrace software-defined networking. Infinera is expected to benefit from rising demand for 100G optical gear and its high-end DTN-X system, which now has 5 tier-1 carrier clients. Separately, Infinera discloses sales chief Ronald Martin is leaving, while assuring investors there's no change to 2012 guidance.

A month after buying software-defined networking (SDN) controller vendor Contrail (I, II), Juniper (JNPR) is outlining its SDN vision. Like Cisco and VMware's Nicira, Juniper is supporting network virtualization and the centralization of management features on a controller. Just as importantly, it's announcing a novel pay-as-you-go software licensing model that allows licenses to be moved between devices. The move follows Cisco's efforts to use SDN to boost software sales, and is arguably an attempt to counter the commoditizing impact SDN could have on Juniper's switches.

Plexus (PLXS) -3.3% AH after warning it expects to report FQ1 (Dec. quarter) revenue of $531M and EPS of $0.45-$0.47, below a consensus of $562.5M and $0.52. The contract manufacturer claims its networking/communications business didn't see "typical demand-pull" in the final weeks of the quarter. Plexus was clobbered in November after announcing the company's relationship one of its key networking customers, Juniper, will end this fiscal year. Jan. 7, 2013, 7:02 PM
Juniper (JNPR +2.9%) has rallied two days in a row since announcing its $176M purchase of software-defined networking (SDN) startup Contrail Systems (I, II). Light Reading thinks Contrail could be working on a genuine open standards-based SDN controller, something very different from the semi-proprietary solutions of Cisco and VMWare/Nicira. Stifel notes Cisco's (CSCO) plans for its OPEN SDN architecture involve selling proprietary software for its switches - thus, SDN appears a means to its goal of doubling software sales over the next 5 years.

Dec. 14, 2012, 12:40 PM
Juniper (JNPR) acquisition target Contrail Systems has test customers for a network virtualization solution that can manage existing Cisco and Juniper gear, notes GigaOm. The idea is to deliver a software-defined networking solution that won't require big changes to existing enterprise networks, while still providing the technology's hardware management and programmability benefits. Cisco (CSCO) acquisition target Cariden is looking to do something similar, but for carrier networks.

Dec. 12, 2012, 7:17 PM
Like many of its peers, Juniper (JNPR) is betting big on software-defined networking (SDN): the company is issuing 5.82M shares and $57.5M in cash to buy the shares of SDN startup Contrail Systems it doesn't already own; the total valuation is $176M. Contrail, which recently snagged the CTO of Juniper's JUNOS OS, has been in stealth mode, though its blog posts suggest it might be working on an SDN software controller that will compete with VMware's (VMW) Nicira unit, seen as a threat to Cisco and Juniper's hardware margins.

Dec. 12, 2012, 4:33 PM
Cisco (CSCO +2.6%) is rallying as analysts give a thumbs-up to its analyst day. Goldman is pleased with Cisco's 3-5-year opex guidance, and argues software-defined networking is "an incremental software revenue opportunity rather than a threat," though others feel differently. Raymond James expects services growth to prop up Cisco's margins, and thinks its routing margin pressures (stemming partly from carrier adoption of router bypass tech) indicate "an under-appreciated headwind" for rival Juniper (JNPR).

Dec. 10, 2012, 2:04 PM
Cisco (CSCO +1.3%) and Juniper (JNPR +3.9%) are higher, possibly aided by a Credit Suisse note downplaying the threat posed by software-defined networking (SDN) solutions, such as those offered by VMware's (VMW) Nicira.  CS notes most of the IT pros it spoke with at a conference were "simply trying to understand what is SDN," and argues Cisco has a "practical and flexible" SDN strategy (I, II, III). Others have suggested SDN fragmentation between controller standards pushed by Cisco, Nicira, and the OpenFlow camp are a problem. Cisco's analyst day is tomorrow.

The router and Ethernet switch markets, a.k.a. Cisco's (CSCO) meal ticket, respectively declined 0.2% and 4.4% in Q3, per IDC. Declining low-end switch sales more than offset a 10.7% Y/Y increase in 10-gig sales. Cisco's switch share fell 340 bps Y/Y to 62.2%, thanks to competition from H-P (9.3% share) and others.The lack of growth in the router and Ethernet switch markets, together with the leads held by F5, Riverbed, Fortinet, and others in faster-growing networking segments, is making it very tough for Cisco to return to double-digit growth.

Some of Berenberg's 2013 tech predictions: 1) The R&D-intensive mobile chip market will see consolidation and possible exits, benefiting Qualcomm, Samsung, and MediaTek at the expense of rivals. 2) Samsung will rely on its own baseband chips, a negative for Qualcomm, Broadcom, and others. 3) Huawei will strike a reseller deal with IBM, which will threaten Cisco and Juniper's margins. 4) Apple will launch an iOS MacBook Air (questionable), a cheaper iPhone (less so), and the mythical Apple TV set. 5) Windows 8 and Windows Phone will disappoint.

Software-defined networking (SDN) may be a threat to Cisco and Juniper, but it's an opportunity for Broadcom (BRCM), since it could boost the usage of commodity switches running on Broadcom's network processors. The EE Times reports Broadcom  is working with app developers and two unnamed OEMs to create an API that would support both traditional networks and the popular OpenFlow SDN standard. During Broadcom's Q2 earnings call, CEO Scott McGregor claimed his company is "working with pretty much everybody in the SDN space."

Nov. 6, 2012, 5:01 PM
Ahead of its investor day, Ericsson (ERIC -1.2%) forecast the telecom equipment market will show a CAGR of just 3%-5% from 2012-2015. In light of all the bad earnings news and capex forecasts to hit the telecom equipment space lately, not too many will argue with Ericsson's assessment. The company does, however, think the telecom services, support solutions, and OSS software markets, where it has been trying to grow its positions, will post healthier (though not spectacular) CAGRs.

Nov. 6, 2012, 1:43 PM
Crushed this year due to weak U.S. service provider capex, Calix (CALX +15.9%) has taken off after beating lowered estimates and guiding on its earnings call for Q4 revenue (excludes the Ericsson deal) of $87M and EPS of $0.05, nearly even with a consensus of $87M and $0.06. Calix and Acme Packet's results are lifting telecom equipment peers, many of whom sold off earlier this week: ADTN +1.9%. CIEN +3.8%. JNPR +2.5%. SONS +3.9%. Oct. 26, 2012, 2:03 PM
The Street initially seemed comfortable with the soft Q4 guidance Juniper (JNPR -8.3%) provided with its Q3 report, but it's had a change of heart. Earnings call remarks about there being "no evidence of ... a significant improvement in the spending environment over the next few quarters" are likely a big reason why. Other networking equipment/component names are also off: CSCO -1.9%. CIEN -3.3%. JDSU -2.9%. RVBD -3.3%. FNSR -2.9%. APKT -2.6%. Soft guidance from Corning, Altera, and Broadcom could also be having an impact.

Oct. 24, 2012, 11:59 AM
More on Juniper's Q3: Q4 guidance is for revenue of $1.1B-$1.13B and EPS of $0.19-$0.22, below a consensus of $1.15B and $0.24. Q3 product revenue -3% Y/Y, services +15%. Routing product sales -7% Y/Y (share losses to Cisco), switching +20% (share gains), security -9% (likely share losses to Palo Alto Networks). Service provider revenue +3%, enterprise -2%. Switching/routing chief Stefan Dyckerhoff stepping down to become a VC, will remain a consultant. JNPR +2.5% AH. (PR)

Juniper (JNPR +4.3%) gives back the majority of its early gains as analysts prove skeptical that EMC would consider buying the company, as is suggested by a rumor. Cantor, UBS, Goldman, and Oppenheimer all consider an EMC-Juniper unlikely, though Oppenehimer thinks Ericsson or a P-E firm could be interested. Also, a source tells Reuters Juniper hasn't hired an i-bank to facilitate a purchase, contradicting the rumor.

Oct. 18, 2012, 12:33 PM
Juniper (JNPR +9.2%) soars on a slightly old rumor it has hired JPMorgan to help find a buyer, and that one bid is reportedly in the mid-to-high $20s. EMC, long rumored to be thinking about acquiring a networking vendor as its partnership with Cisco frays, is named as a potentially interested party. Juniper (current market cap of $9.7B) wouldn't be an easy fish for EMC (current market cap of $53.8B) to digest, especially after baking in a premium.

Juniper (JNPR +3.8%) outperforms ahead of its Oct. 23 Q3 report after Morgan Stanley predicts Q4 guidance will be strong: the firm expects Verizon will continue deploying Juniper's costly PTX Ethernet switches and T4000 routers, and that AT&T will buy more MX-series edge routers (previous). Verizon and AT&T's muted capex (particularly for wireline networks) has dinged the shares of many telecom equipment names. MKM is taking a more guarded view of Juniper, predicting Q4 guidance will be light due to weak industry capex.

ZTE shares plunge 15.1% in Hong Kong after China's second-largest telecom-equipment maker warns that it will make a Q3 loss of up to 2B yuan ($319.1M). ZTE blames a delay in some overseas deals and a large number of low-margin contracts in Europe, Asia and the domestic market. U.S.-listed shares on watch include ALU (-1.7% in Paris), ERIC (-0.85% in Stockholm), CSCO, JNPR,CIEN, MMI, BBND. (PR)

Juniper (JNPR) boasts its new MX2020 carrier edge router offers 67% more capacity than any rival solution, at least once new line cards arrive. The MX2020 is 3x bigger than Juniper's largest edge router to date, and, together with the JunosV App Engine, should put the company on better footing relative to market leaders Cisco and Alcatel-Lucent. Cisco's ASR9000 edge routers rely on EZchip's (EZCH) network processors, while Juniper and Alcatel use proprietary chips.

Juniper (JNPR), which had 9,373 employees as of the end of June, has laid off 500 workers as part of a restructuring. Many of the cuts reportedly target the company's QFabric switching op. Introduced to much hype in Feb. '11, QFabric, which allows the resources of multiple switches to be pooled, has seen underwhelming demand thus far, as rival Cisco (CSCO) continues to dominate the data center switch market. Updated: Juniper says the layoffs aren't targeting QFabric or any particular line.

Telecom equipment and optical component names slump in response to Adtran's (ADTN -8.9%) warning. CIEN -3.1%. JNPR -2.1%. APKT -3.3%. JDSU -3.5%. FNSR -4.3%. Adtran heavily blamed its shortfall on "delays in project rollouts" from U.S. carriers. That's a familiar refrain for both Adtran and its peers. AT&T and Verizon are doing their best to restrain capex in order to boost near-term profits, and the money that they are spending is increasingly focused on their faster-growing wireless ops.

Sep. 28, 2012, 11:00 AM
Kireeti Kompella, the CTO for Juniper's (JNPR) Junos OS, has left the company to join Contrail Systems, a startup working on a software-defined networking (SDN) solution. The defection, which is important given Junos underpins most of Juniper's networking gear, highlights the challenges larger networking and IT hardware firms face in keeping top talent from leaving for startups working on cutting-edge tech. Cisco (CSCO) recently created a funding arm to address this issue.

Also selling off (previous) thanks to the poor guidance accompanying Ciena's FQ3 report: TLAB -3%. ALU -2.2%. CALX -2.9%. JNPR -4.6%. NPTN -3.8%. OCLR -3.9%. With AT&T and Verizon trying to boost near-term profits by keeping capex down, European carriers struggling with macro and debt issues, and Chinese carriers also beginning to put the brakes on spending, there are plenty of reasons to be worried about telecom equipment demand.

Aug. 30, 2012, 11:33 AM
Cisco (CSCO +7.6%) jumps after beating estimates, hiking its dividend, and providing guidance and commentary that suggests its demand outlook (and perhaps the broader outlook for IT spending) is neither rosy nor terrible. At Cisco's current valuation, that's good enough for a strong rally. Goldman (Conviction Buy) thinks Cisco should no longer trade at a discount to other tech large-caps, but Needham (Hold) is less impressed. JNPR +2.7%. APKT +3.6%. FFIV +4.4%. RVBD +3.4%. ALU +4.8%.

Juniper and Riverbed's results/guidance are stoking a rally in enterprise networking and telecom equipment stocks, many of whom have been volatile in response to earnings and capex news. CSCO +2.6%. FFIV +3.3%. CIEN +4.4%. CALX +6.7%. NTGR +4.5%. ARUN +7.3%. ERIC +2.6%. Needham, which launched coverage of Riverbed with a Strong Buy last month, is praising its strong pipeline and improving sales metrics. Jefferies likes Juniper's cost-reduction efforts.

Juniper (JNPR +12.1%) and Riverbed (RVBD +27.8%), both of whom had forgettable springs, continue to soar after posting Q2 results (I, II), issuing better-than-feared guidance, and striking a partnership related to Riverbed's application delivery controller (ADC) tech. Radware (RDWR -9.2%) is selling off in response: though the company says an existing ADC software deal related to Juniper's edge routers is intact, many were hoping a bigger deal would arrive.

More on Juniper and Riverbed's partnership: Juniper will license Riverbed's application delivery controller (ADC) technology for $75M, and the companies will collaborate on WAN optimization and mobile app acceleration solutions. The partnership is a challenge to ADC leader F5 (FFIV). JNPR +4.6% and RVBD +23.4% following the companies' Q2 reports (I, II).  Riverbed is guiding for Q3 revenue of $214M-$219M and EPS of $0.25-$0.26, above a consensus of $210.4M and $0.24.

VMware's (VMW -0.6%) purchase of Nicira is a "significant negative" for Cisco (CSCO -5.9%) and Juniper (JNPR -1.2%), argues MKM. The firm notes Google (a big supporter of software-defined networking) has reportedly installed Nicira's software in its newest data center, and that Cisco generates $14B/year in switch sales at a ~60% gross margin. Other Nicira customers include AT&T, eBay, NTT, and (notably, given its cloud infrastructure presence) Rackspace. (earlier)

Huawei's 1H results are more proof of the tough capex environment facing wireline and mobile telecom equipment firms. Revenue rose just 5% Y/Y to CNY102.7B ($16.1B) - a notable slowdown for a company gaining share in many markets - and operating profit fell 22%. Still, Huawei is maintaining its target for 15%-20% 2012 sales growth. Rival ZTE delivered an ugly warning earlier this month, and so did Alcatel-Lucent and some U.S. vendors. Can mobile data growth drive a turnaround? Jul. 24, 2012, 1:53 PM
Cisco (CSCO -5%) and Juniper (JNPR -3.6%) slump as investors weigh the impact of VMware's (VMW -0.9%) purchase of Nicira. Nicira has minimal sales right now, but its business model centers around eliminating proprietary Ethernet switches from the likes of Cisco and Juniper, and replacing them with commodity gear managed by Nicira's software. Cisco is working on a similar solution, but its main priority still remains selling its proprietary Nexus and Catalyst switches. (VMW transcript)

Palo Alto Networks (PANW) prices its 6.2M-share IPO at $42, above a prior range of $38-$40. The price translates into a valuation of $2.8B. Palo Alto, a leading vendor of next-generation firewalls, posted sales of $179.5M (+129% Y/Y) in the 9 months ending April 30, and net income of $5.4M. The company is seen as a threat to Check Point (CHKP), Juniper (JNPR), and other traditional firewall vendors. Juniper sued Palo Alto last December. (previous)

If there's a theme to Q2 tech earnings reports so far, it's "good enough." Just as several large-caps have rallied on so-so results, beaten-down telecom equipment and optical component names are rallying on Verizon's guidance for "flat to down" 2012 capex - some feared worse guidance in light of recent warnings. CIEN +5%. ALU +6.9%. JDSU +2%. FNSR +3%. JNPR +2.8%. Nomura sees Verizon's comments about 40G/100G optical investments as a positive for Juniper and Ciena.

Jul. 19, 2012, 12:11 PM
In spite of posting a mixed Q2 report, Check Point (CHKP +6.9%) closed with big gains. A new $1B stock buyback (good for buying 10% of outstanding shares) helped, as did in-line Q3 guidance (revenue of $316M-$345M and EPS of $0.74-$0.81 vs. consensus of $339.9M and $0.79) that soothed concerns about heavy Euro dependence (39% of sales). Security hardware peers also rallied on a very good day for enterprise tech. FTNT +10.4%. FIRE +6.4%. JNPR +6.7%.

Jul. 18, 2012, 4:03 PM
Today's crash in Alcatel-Lucent (ALU -17.9%), the result of more ugly earnings news, is leading many to question its survival, at least without a major restructuring. Nomura's Stuart Jeffrey notes Alcatel's remarks about failing to reach its operating margin guidance suggest it will struggle to turn cash flow positive. Goldman has argued liquidity pressures could arrive by 2013. Plenty of other telecom equipment names have warned. CIEN -2.9%. TLAB -2.4%. (Q1 miss)

Jul. 17, 2012, 10:22 AM
As Palo Alto Networks prepares for an IPO likely to give it a $2B+ valuation (symbol: PANW), the next-generation firewall (NGFW) vendor may want to thank Cisco (CSCO) for scrapping an NGFW project in order to focus on traditional firewalls, which are less adept at handling Web traffic by application. Juniper (JNPR) was also slow to respond, as was firewall leader Check Point (CHKP). Palo Alto is one of several focused upstarts causing headaches for Cisco.

Telecom equipment and optical component names fell yesterday due to Adtran's results, and today they're underperforming with the help oft Calix's (CALX -25.5%) warning. JDSU -3.3%. ALLT -4.9%. ADTN -3.6%. JNPR -2.7%. FNSR -2.8%. Aside from macro conditions, wireline telecom capex budgets are being pressured by  the data demands of mobile networks, and the heavy debt loads of Euro carriers. Juniper reports on July 23.

Jul. 12, 2012, 10:11 AM
Calix (CALX -10.2%) falls 23.8% AH after warning it expects Q2 revenue of $79M and EPS of $0.04, far below a consensus of $95.1M and $0.10. The broadband infrastructure provider, already hit hard by Adtran's Q2 report, blames weak service provider capex in multiple markets. The capex cuts, in turn, are blamed on macro issues and regulatory uncertainty. UBS' call on telecom capex is looking quite accurate at this point.

Juniper (JNPR), trying to lift flagging enterprise hardware sales, is preparing a revamp of its channel partner program, one that the company calls its most significant since the program's inception 7 years ago. Expanded investments in marketing and technical training are accompanying the overhaul.

UBS, which has been airing bearish comments about the telecom equipment space for a while (I, II), thinks RVBD, FFIV, JNPR, and ARUN are at risk of missing Q2 estimates or lowering guidance due to a weakening demand from Europe (previous) and the U.S. government. ARRS, GLW, and ADTN are viewed as relatively immune. Separately, Caris is joining a growing list of firms (I, II, III) to slash estimates for F5.

While Alcatel-Lucent (ALU) is trumpeting its entry into the high-margin core router market, currently dominated by Cisco (CSCO) and Juniper (JNPR), Cisco is asserting Alcatel's offering, the XRS 7950, is an edge router at heart. A Cisco exec notes the 7950, unlike Cisco's CRS-3, doesn't yet allow multiple boxes to function as one unit. Alcatel counters by pointing out Cisco and Juniper's hardware only recently added that feature, and many carriers don't use it. (also)

Juniper (JNPR -3.4%) slumps toward its 52-week low after FBR lowers its PT to $14 from $24 on concerns about the company's product transitions, and its ability to keep pace with Cisco's (CSCO) latest solutions. Cisco, which poached several Juniper execs last year, has been taking share in the core router and Ethernet switch markets.

Cisco (CSCO +2.2%) rallies on an upgrade to Outperform from BMO's Tim Long, who thinks the strength of the company's data center offerings will drive growth. Long adds new Cisco switches have "stymied competitors" such as JNPR and HPQ, and the company is gaining share in the lucrative core router market. The data center networking market has seen healthy growth in recent quarters, as the adoption of cloud services and virtualization help drive demand for costlier 10G equipment.

Shares of Juniper Networks (JNPR -4.1%) trade lower following a hard-hitting downgrade from Needham's Alex Henderson. The crux of the analyst's argument is that Juniper's current and planned product lines won't change margin erosion or a moderating growth path.

Jun. 7, 2012, 2:06 PM
IT security threats are now more likely to occur at the application level than the switch/router level, argues Needham's Alex Henderson, and he thinks this puts Juniper's (JNPR) hardware at a disadvantage relative to solutions from  Check Point (CHKP), F5 (FFIV), and others. Also, like Goldman, Henderson is worried about the impact of Alcatel-Lucent's (ALU) arrival in the core router market. He sees as F5 as the best way to play the broader trend towards application-level networking.

Cisco (CSCO) launches its ASR 5500 edge router, which (unlike other ASR models) is built specifically with mobile networks in mind. Cisco boasts the router, which looks to profit from skyrocketing mobile data traffic, contains a number of mobile-specific policy and protocol features, and has already been adopted by Verizon and India's Bharti Airtel. Rival Juniper (JNPR) is also targeting the mobile infrastructure market via Project Falcon. (also)

More on Cisco's IP traffic forecast: While the 29% growth rate forecast by the company (revenue growth is lower due to price declines) represents a slowdown from prior years, Cisco expects mobile traffic to grow 18x from 2011 to 2016 - a positive for vendors with strong mobile networking exposure. Also: Cisco sees over half of all 2016 traffic coming from Wi-Fi networks, and expects the number of global Internet users, boosted by smartphone adoption, to reach 3.4B (up from 1.9B in 2010).

Mobile devices now make up 20.2% of U.S. web traffic, according to ad network Chitika - smartphones account for 14.6%, and tablets, which are seeing traffic grow especially quickly, make up 5.6%. Such growth, which AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) claim justifies their spectrum-purchase attempts, begs the question of how long carriers can maintain their muted capex spending - infrastructure providers such as ERIC, ALU, JNPR, FFIV, ALLT and PKT badly hope there's a pickup.

Alcatel-Lucent (ALU +4.7%), down ~40% since February, outperforms with the help of bullish commentary regarding its 7950 XRS core router line, launched yesterday. Deutsche thinks the products offer "meaningful improvements" over rival offerings, and could take 5%-10% of the U.S. core router market simply by leveraging Alcatel's mobile carrier relationships. Goldman thinks the hardware could cause some headaches for Juniper (JNPR -4.8%). (previous)

Fast-growing enterprise videoconferencing firm Vidyo is set to close a $97M funding round that includes an investment from Juniper (JNPR). Vidyo's solutions, which use a combo of routing technology and proprietary software, have been causing headaches for market leaders Cisco (CSCO) and Polycom (PLCM), each of whom recently reported soft videoconferencing gear sales (I, II). Juniper may be interested in integrating Vidyo's tech with its own networking hardware. May 22, 2012, 2:21 PM
Alcatel-Lucent (ALU +0.7%) has released its 7950 XRS line, its first products for a lucrative core router market currently dominated by Cisco (CSCO) and Juniper (JNPR). The 7950 line offers very high densities and runs on Alcatel's hyped FP3 network processor, which can handle 400 Gbps transmission speeds. Carrier inertia and comfort with Cisco and Juniper's software will be major challenges for Alcatel, but Nomura is optimistic the company can carve a niche.

After conducting checks, Oppenheimer thinks Radware (RDWR +6.5%) is in advanced negotiations to license its ADC engine to Juniper (JNPR -0.1%). The firm thinks the deal could be worth about $70M - $100M over three to five years, and lead to an annual EPS increase of about $0.75 per share for Radware.

May 16, 2012, 11:45 AM
Nomura's Stuart Jeffrey thinks Alcatel-Lucent's (ALU +3.8%) May 22 core router announcement could be a game-changer. Alcatel's success in the edge router market (it has a 24% share) suggests it has a shot at disrupting Cisco (CSCO) and Juniper's (JNPR) near-duopoly in the core, Jeffrey argues, and a 10%-20% share would result in a 6%-14% 2014 operating income boost. Alcatel's carrier switch/router business was a bright spot in a dismal Q1, growing 23.5% Y/Y.

Juniper (JNPR -4%) sells off after Caris' John Slack starts coverage with an Average rating. Slack thinks expectations of a recovery in carrier spending (64% of Juniper's sales) are baked into estimates, and is worried about macro conditions and Juniper's ability to quickly convert bookings into revenue. Yesterday, JDS Uniphase (JDSU -3.9%) said delays in carrier orders were partly responsible for its FQ3 revenue weakness.

27% of CIOs surveyed by UBS expect Cisco (CSCO) to gain share this year, the best reading for the company in 4 surveys. The CIOs are more cautious about Juniper (JNPR): only 10%-15% plan to trial Juniper's high-end QFabric Ethernet switch platform this year, and none will fully deploy until 2013. Cisco has been picking up share in markets such as videoconferencing, Ethernet switching, routing, and storage networking. Earnings are due on May 9. (previous)

Juniper (JNPR -6.6%) gives back most of the gains it saw after delivering its Q1 report prior to yesterday's close, as the Street digests its soft guidance. During its earnings call, Juniper said interest in its QFabric switches and T4000 routers was strong, but also aired cautious comments about service provider and EMEA sales.

More on Juniper's (JNPR +8%) Q1 report: The company is guiding for Q2 revenue of $1.03B-$1.06B and EPS of $0.15-$0.17 vs. a consensus of $1.05B and $0.20. Q1 product sales fell 9% Y/Y to $772M, while service revenue rose 16% to $261M. Router sales (62% of product revenue) fell 21% Y/Y (likely share losses to Cisco), offsetting a 23% increase in switch sales (boosted by QFabric) and slightly higher security/other revenue. Enterprise and service provider sales both fell. (PR)

Google (GOOG), which relies on home-grown switches for its massive infrastructure, is throwing its weight behind OpenFlow, a networking protocol supported by upstart switch vendors looking to challenge the proprietary solutions of CSCO, JNPR, and others. While remaining committed to their proprietary hardware, the giants are officially supporting OpenFlow, which relies on a technology called software-defined networking.

Apr. 17, 2012, 12:54 PM | 1 Comment
Web giants such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook have long been relying on home-grown servers custom-built to their specifications, and now they're increasingly doing the same for their networking hardware. Their growing use of private-label servers built by Asian manufacturers is having an impact on sales of more costly, proprietary gear from the likes of Cisco (CSCO), Juniper (JNPR), and Brocade (BRCD).

Juniper (JNPR +1.4%) rises following a positive note from ISI. The firm expects product cycles surrounding Juniper's T4000 core routers, PTX and QFabric switches, MobileNext wireless solutions, and ACX telecom access routers to give the company a lift in 2012 and 2013. Though these products contain meaningful innovations, it's worth noting ISI was making similar remarks before Juniper issued its Q4 warning.

Mar. 28, 2012, 9:52 AM
Though it lost a bit of share in 2011 thanks to a weak 1H, Cisco (CSCO) still dominates the enterprise router market, with Infonetics estimating its share to be near 75%. Interestingly, H-P (HPQ), for whom networking is one of very few bright spots, has passed Juniper (JNPR) to become the market's #2 vendor, doubling its share in 2011 thanks to strong exposure to the fast-growing Chinese market.

Adtran (ADTN +4%) rallies in spite of issuing a major warning. Due to soft carrier orders, the telecom equipment maker now expects Q1 revenue of $130M-$135M and EPS of $0.22-$0.25, well below a consensus of $174.7M and $0.44. However, Adtran, which had already seen a raft of negative analyst notes (I, II, III), says order rates have "substantially improved" in March. Possibly up in sympathy: JNPR +3.3%. CIEN +3%.

AT&T (T), facing an uproar over its throttling of download speeds to heavy data users, defends itself by arguing its data traffic doubled in 2011. This was actually less than the 172% growth estimated by Cisco for overall U.S. traffic. The torrid growth seen in mobile data usage stands to boost demand for infrastructure gear from PKT, ALLT, JNPR, and others, though carriers have been effective at limiting capex increases thus far.

Feb. 15, 2012, 11:28 AM
Cisco (CSCO) and Juniper (JNPR) could face a long-term challenge from startups such as Nicira, who use a combination of third-party chips and network virtualization technology to enable switching solutions they tout as both cheaper than traditional offerings, and more flexible from a software/services standpoint. However, Cisco and Juniper assert their proprietary solutions still offer major performance benefits.

While Auriga isn't too concerned about Juniper's (JNPR +0.2%) Q4 warning, Wedbush (Neutral) thinks it suggests other names dependent on service provider capex, such as CSCO, FFIV, NTCT, BSFT, ALLT, and RDWR, "could see volatility" going forward. Meanwhile, Goldman (Neutral) thinks Juniper's warning is partly due to share losses to Cisco in the core router market.

Jan. 10, 2012, 2:15 PM
Investors seem to agree with Auriga's Sandeep Shyamsukha that Juniper's (JNPR +0.8%) reduced guidance isn't too surprising given broadly weaker service provider spending, and shares remain positive in early trading. Shyamsukha says to stay the course, viewing JNPR as "well positioned to benefit from an expected uptick in router spending at servant content providers."

Quick take on Juniper: While macro issues are having an impact, some of Juniper's problems appear company-specific. Particularly in security hardware, where rivals Check Point (CHKP) and Fortinet (FTNT) are faring better, and enterprise switching, where Cisco's (CSCO) aggressive pricing and low-end competition from the likes of Dell (DELL) and HP (HPQ) are making things difficult.
