Banks head lower following rate hike
The major averages, bonds, and gold have all turned higher after the Fed lifted the Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points, but satiated bank bulls might be lightening up just a hair.After all, the "dots" showed the Fed as being no more hawkish than a couple of meetings back when it surprised the world by predicting three rate hikes this year. Inflation and growth expectations were essentially unchanged as well.So while the Fed may have been faster with a rate hike than many expected just a couple of weeks back, it appears the timetable past today remains the same.KBE -0.15%, KRE -0.1%, XLF flatJanet Yellen's press conference is just getting underway.Bank of America (BAC -0.2%), Citigroup (C -0.6%), JPMorgan (JPM +0.3%), Wells Fargo (WFC +0.1%), Goldman Sachs (GS +0.1%), U.S. Bancorp (USB +0.3%), PNC Financial (PNC -0.4%), KeyCorp (KEY +0.2%), Regions Financial (RF), SunTrust (STI -1%), Fifth Third (FITB -0.7%)ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, BTO, IYG, FNCL, SEF, FXO, RYF, FINU, RWW, XLFS, FINZ, JHMF, FAZZ, FNCF

Bureaucracy 1, Dodd-Frank reformers 0
For now, Washington D.C. is winning the battle against those in favor of quickly rolling back swaths of Dodd-Frank. For now, the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee are working on other things, while Republicans instead spend political capital on things like Obamacare repeal and tax reform.Barney Frank is taking a victory lap, telling Bloomberg nothing substantial will get through Congress. He does expect the possibility of relief for smaller banks, but the likes of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and others probably shouldn't be holding their breath for big changes.KBW's Brian Gardner: “Changes to the Dodd-Frank Act are second-tier agenda items and are unlikely to pass Congress in the near term ... Improvement in the regulatory regime is likely to be subtle and not seen by the public."

BofA funding puts Raiders Las Vegas move back on track
To review, the move was put in doubt earlier this year when Las Vegas Sands chief Sheldon Adelson and Goldman Sachs pulled out of the funding for a new stadium deal.It was reported yesterday that the Raiders (and Clark County, NV) have added Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) as a partner, and that funding for the 65K seat domed stadium is in place. BofA's $650M contribution will be a loan only, and will not include any equity stake.The rest of the funding comes from the Raiders and bonds backed by an increase in the Clark County hotel room tax.

The major averages are flat, but the XLF, KBE and KRE are all higher by 0.5% or more as yield-starved financials look forward to what's almost becoming the certainty of a Fed rate hike this month.It's a remarkable turnaround in sentiment given we entered the week with futures markets pricing in just 25% chance of a Fed move in March. A series of Fed speakers, however - concluding with Janet Yellen today - managed to turn those bets upside down.

Defending buybacks, bullish on BofA, and other tidbits from Berkshire's annual letter
"Some people have come close to calling [buybacks] un-American - characterizing them as corporate misdeeds that divert funds needed for productive endeavors,” says Warren Buffett. "That simply isn't the case." If anything, he says, American corporations and private investors have too much cash looking to be "sensibly deployed." If anybody knows of an enticing project that's died for lack of capital of late, please drop a dime to Omaha, he urges.Where The Oracle does have an issue with buybacks are when corporate chiefs pay too much them. This isn't the case for Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), he says, where repurchased shares have been underpriced. Berkshire's (BRK.A, BRK.B) $5B preferred stake in BofA carries warrants allowing the purchase of 700M shares of common any time prior to Sept. 2021. While Buffett has said he's not planning on exercising until shortly before expiration, he now says he would exchange early into the common should the annual dividend (now $0.30 per share) rise to $0.44.He spends a sizable section of the letter attacking money-management fees. "When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients ... If a statue is ever erected to honor the person who has done the most for American investors, the hands down choice should be Jack Bogle."There's  still a few months to go, but Buffett also declares victory in his crisis-era bet that the S&P 500 would outperform a portfolio of funds of hedge funds over a 10-year period. Since, the compounded annual return for the S&P 500 has been 7.1% vs. 2.2% for the funds. Game over.As for Berkshire operations, The Oracle's preferred measure - book value - rose 10.7% in 2016 vs. the S&P 500's 12% return. Full-year earnings of $24.07B were flat from 2015 thanks to a 16% decline in income at BNSF amid a drop in coal demand.Full annual report and letter here

Another 20% upside in BofA - Morgan Stanley
Positive catalysts like tax reform, bigger capital returns, and higher interest rates haven't even played out yet, says Betsy Graseck, reiterating her bull case price target of $30 vs. the current $24.73 (her base base price target is $25).She sees tax reform being settled by November, a capital return bump by June, and larger budget deficits to force another leg up in rates.As for those buybacks and dividends, Graseck estimates Bank of America (BAC +0.8%) has about $21B in excess capital, with net payout ratios rising to 85% next year from 45% in 2016.Takeaways from a recent meeting with CEO Brian Moynihan: Capital return in the #1 priority, with buybacks taking preference over dividends; the bank is on track to hit $3B reduction in expenses vs. 2015 levels.Source: Bloomberg

Banks move to overhaul money laundering rules - Reuters
The Clearing House - a trade association representing the likes of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C) - for some time has questioned the effectiveness of current rules, but now may find a friendlier reception in D.C.Source: Reuters"Now we tell banks to file a (report) on everything that might be criminal," says the head of a compliance software maker, summing up the problem with the current rules. The number of suspicious activity reports rose to nearly 1M last year vs. 669K in 2013.Compliance with the rules is costing U.S. companies up to $8B per year, according to the Heritage Foundation.The new system to be proposed by The Clearing House envisions banks not investigating and reporting every red flag transaction, but instead looking into specific concerns relayed to them by law enforcement. Lenders in different parts of the country may, for instance, be on the lookout for different sorts of activity.

Party continues for big banks: BofA leads with 2% gain
There's nothing too new in Janet Yellen's 2nd day on Capital Hill. As with yesterday, she's giving off a more hawkish vibe than at least some may have expected. The 10-year Treasury yield is higher by three basis points to 2.50%, and Fed Funds futures are now pricing in nearly a 50% chance of a March rate hike (up from less than 25% a few days back).The Fed boss is naturally offering a defense of the current regulatory regime, including the Volcker Rule and the CCAR, but the Trump administration, its now-confirmed Treasury Secretary and the leaders of key congressional committees are working to roll back much of Dodd-Frank.XLF (XLF +0.6%), KBE (KBE +0.4%), KRE (KRE +0.2%)Bank of America (BAC +2.2%), Goldman Sachs (GS +0.8%), Citigroup (C +1.2%), Morgan Stanley (MS +1.1%), Wells Fargo (WFC +0.9%), JPMorgan (JPM +0.9%)

Dollar, banks on the move as Yellen leans hawkish
Testifying before the Senate this morning, Fed Chair Janet Yellen says it would be "unwise" to delay on rate hikes, thus suggesting a move in March could be more likely than previously thought.The 10-year Treasury yield is higher by 6.7 basis points to 2.50%, and Fed Funds futures are pricing in slightly more hawkish Fed policy for the remainder of the year.Also notable was lack of much mention of regulation in Yellen's opening remarks. There had been thought that Yellen would use the opportunity to push back against Trump administration and congressional calls for a sizable rollback of Dodd-Frank and the stress test regime.Welcoming news of higher rates (and no news yet on regulations) is the financial sector: (XLF +0.7%), (KBE +1.2%), (KRE +1.3%)Bank of America (BAC +2%), Wells Fargo (WFC +1%), JPMorgan (JPM +1.2%), Citigroup (C +1.5%), Goldman Sachs (GS +1.2%), Morgan Stanley (MS +2%), Regionsl Financial (RF +1.8%), U.S. Bancorp (USB +0.2%), KeyCorp (KEY +1.5%), PNC Financial (PNC +0.8%), Fifth Third (FITB +1.6%), Lincoln National (LNC +1.7%) MetLife (MET +0.8%), AIG (AIG +0.8%)The dollar (UUP +0.4%) has also moved higher since Yellen took the stage.

Lenders lead advance as House's Hensarling lays out his plans
Writing in the WSJ last night, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee called the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau a rogue agency, purposely created to be insulated from Congressional, presidential, or voter oversight."The regulatory web spun by the CFPB can make every provider of financial services guilty until proven innocent, inviting selective enforcement and financial shakedowns."He notes Dodd-Frank specifically excluded auto lenders from CFPB jurisdiction, but that hasn't stopped Richard Cordray (CFPB chief) and company, as the likes of Santander Consumer (SC +1.2%), Ally Financial (ALLY +1%), and Credit Acceptance Corp. (CACC +1.9%) have found out. The House two years ago voted overwhelmingly voted to stop the CFPB's efforts in this area, but Elizabeth Warren was able to halt the bill in the Senate.The president, says Hensarling, should fire Richard Cordray yesterday, put in place a new director to undo all harmful actions taken by the agency, and then get to work putting policies to work that actually protect consumers.Even with better leadership, though, the CFPB would still be unconstitutional, he continues, so the agency must be "functionally terminated" through a simple majority vote to cut off funding (which comes from the Fed, not Congress).In other Hensarling news, Bloomberg has seen a memo outlining other Dodd-Frank reforms, including reducing stress tests to just every other year.XLF +1.3%, KRE +1.5%, KBE +1.3%OneMain (OMF +4.4%), BofA (BAC +1.6%), Citigroup (C +1.7%), Wells Fargo (WFC +1.7%), JPMorgan (JPM +1.3%), Goldman Sachs (GS +1.7%), Morgan Stanley (MS +2.2%), Regions (RF +2.7%), KeyCorp (KEY +1%), SunTrust (STI +1.6%), BB&T (BBT +1.1%), M&T (MTB +1.2%), Zions (ZION +2%)

Banks lead decline on Wall Street
The KBE and KRE are each down more than 2% vs. the S&P 500's 1% retreat.Pick your excuse, but the best explanation is probably seen in the sharp upward and to the right price charts of the banking sector names, and the occasional need to take a breath.There's also politics, and Treasury Secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin over the weekend provided more evidence that the Trump administration intends to tweak, but not gut Dodd-Frank. At issue is the Volcker Rule which prohibits lenders from taking risky bets with federally-insured deposits.Mnuchin in a letter to lawmakers: "A legal distinction between the insured and non-insured entity is an important factor ...

Opportunity for other card companies as CapOne exits Cabela's deal
Cabela's (NYSE:CAB) had a rough session yesterday after Capital One (NYSE:COF) said it doesn't expect regulatory approval for the two's card deal.This could present opportunity for others, says the team at Stephens, which suggests Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C) and TD Bank (NYSE:TD) may have interest in the portfolio.In Synchrony's case, says Stephens, a purchase at a 10% premium to assets would be 5-10% accretive to earnings.For now, Bass Pro is likely to manage the portfolio in-house and put it up for sale yesterday.Source: BloombergPreviously: Capital One down 1.8% following earnings miss (Jan. 24)

Wall Street moves south
Known as "nearshoring," the trend - in which banks move operations away from expensive financial centers like New York to places like Salt Lake City, or North Carolina, or Jacksonville (the focus of this particular article in Bloomberg) - isn't a new one.It's a way to lower costs without heading out of the country - of particular import given the new leadership in D.C. In the case of Jacksonville, high-end corporate office space can be had for about $22 per square foot - roughly 25% of the rate in NYC. Bank employees in Jacksonville earn about 30% less than those in The Big Apple.For workers, the cost of living is appreciably lower, commute times shorter, and a walk on the beach is possible at lunch. They do have to give up things like round-the-clock delivery of any imaginable food, though.Among those with operations in Jacksonville: Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), BofA (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).

Rejection of Aetna/Humana deal could cast pall over M&A - Compass Point
Yesterday's court ruling against the $37B merger of Humana and Aetna alone could cost investment banks more than $100M, according to Compass Point's Charles Peabody, including $41M for Goldman (NYSE:GS), $45M for Citi (NYSE:C), and $15M for Lazard (NYSE:LAZ).Then there's other pending deals like Anthem/Cigna, AT&T/Time Warner, Monsanto/Bayer, and their key advisors like Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Citi.In addition to what regulators might say, M&A animal spirits may retreat to the sidelines until potential corporate tax changes become clearer.Bottom line: Q1 estimates at the money center banks are assuming improvement in capital markets results, not the lull that might instead be coming (Compass Point is expecting a 15% rise in announced M&A volumes this year to $4.2T).Source: BloombergETFs: KCE

Son of ABX coming to Wall Street
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) are among those giving price data to startup Vista Capital Advisors, which - working with Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) - plans to create indexes of MBS which could be used as the basis for derivatives.Source: Matt Scully at BloombergIn the pre-crisis era, derivatives based on the ABX indexes allowed massive bets on and against the U.S. housing market, eventually affording folks like John Paulson and his team even bigger Hamptons mansions, and causing the downfalls of shops like AIG which took the other side.These new derivatives, however, would be tied to higher quality mortgages then the subprime types favored prior to the property blowup. The new paper will be linked to what's known as "credit-risk transfer" securities issued by Fannie Mae (OTCQB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac (OTCQB:FMCC), which force losses on investors when borrowers default. Since 2013 when the GSEs began selling these, they've offloaded nearly $400B of risk to bond investors, theoretically lowering taxpayer risk.Vista has some heavy hitters backing it, including Dimensional Fund co-founder David Booth and former Citigroup chairman John Reed. There's also the requisite Nobel Laureate - Robert Merton of Black-Scholes fame.

Breakups may still be on agenda for big banks
After the big rally in the banks since roughly this time last year, the clamor for breaking them up has died down. Return on equity, however, remains historically low, and the chiefs of the Too Big To Fail lenders may again find themselves facing calls to break up or sell off assets, write Lionel Laurent and Gillian Tan at Bloomberg.Citigroup (NYSE:C) makes for an obvious case - its price to tangible book value ratio is less than 1x, a sizable discount to peers (WFC and JPM are approaching 2x, and BAC, MS, GS are all around 1.3x). At least part of that is due to Citi's lower returns and sizable overseas exposure, they write.Should an activist get involved, it could come alongside the appointment of, say, Thomas Hoenig - a supporter of bringing back Glass-Steagall - as vice chair of the Fed (though word is Hoenig has moved to #2 on the depth chart for that spot).

Investors give 'thumbs up' to bank earnings; KBE +2.3%
There was a bit of caution among bank investors in the past couple of days, but they're back to buying low and selling high this morning as the initial results from Q4 begin to pour in. Among those reporting today: Bank of America (BAC +1.8%), JPMorgan (JPM +1.9%), Wells Fargo (WFC +2.8%), PNC Financial (PNC +2.4%), First Horizon (FHN -0.3%).KBE +2.3%, KRE +2.5%; the S&P 500 is ahead 0.3%.An early take from KBW's Bose George: Mortgage banking trends are weakening in line with expectations - with stronger volumes being offset by lower gain-on-sale margins. Higher rates are still filtering through though, and industry sources and recent data suggest volumes falling 10-15% this quarter.Piper's Kevin Barker calls Wells Fargo's operating numbers "decent," but notes rising auto loan net charge-offs - 1.05% in Q4  vs. 0.87% in Q3, and 0.59% a year earlier.Bloomberg's Alison Williams takes note of the positive signal of boosted buybacks at Bank of America, and calls cost cuts "key." It's hard to get too excited about any particular metric given the bank's near-50% run higher in the past few months.Other players: Goldman (GS +1.1%), Morgan Stanley (MS +2%), Citigroup (C +1.6%), U.S. Bancorp (USB +1.3%), Regions Financial (RF +3.2%), New York Community (NYCB +1.3%), Huntington Bancshares (HBAN +2.2%), KeyCorp (KEY +2.3%)

The Q4 earnings beat was driven mostly by a lower tax rate and lower expenses, says Goldman Sachs in a quick first-take on Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) results. Core earnings of $0.37 compared to the Goldman's team estimate of $0.38.Goldman's bullish view on BofA remains largely intact thanks to leverage to higher rates and continued cost control. The stock is on the Conviction List with a $27 price target suggesting nearly another 20% of upside.Downside risks include a slower rise in interest rates and slower economic growth.Shares now lower by 0.85% premarket as satiated bulls use the earnings news as a reason to cash in some chips.Previously: BofA edges higher after topping bottom-line estimates (Jan. 13)Previously: Bank of America beats by $0.02, misses on revenue (Jan. 13)

Banks lead S&P 500 lower as bulls lighten up ahead of earnings
Q4 earnings season kicks off tomorrow morning with Bank of America (BAC -1.1%), Wells Fargo (WFC -0.8%), JPMorgan (JPM -0.8%), PNC Financial(PNC -3%), First Horizon (FHN -2.1%), and First Republic (FRC -1.4%) all reporting. BlackRock (BLK -1.4%) is also due up tomorrow.Among those next coming next week: Citigroup (C -1.2%), Goldman Sachs (GS -1%), and Morgan Stanley (MS -1.2%).The KBE is up a whopping 40% Y/Y, including a 23.5% run since the election. It's lower by 1.9% on today's session vs. the S&P 500's 0.5% decline.Giving well-fed financial sector bulls another reason to take some profits is the continued decline in interest rates over the past few weeks, with the 10-year yield lower by another six basis points today to 2.32% - it topped at about 2.60% in mid-December.KeyCorp (KEY -2%), Regions Financial (RF -1.5%), Fifth Third (FITB -1.5%), State Street (STT -1.7%), MetLife (MET -1.9%), Prudential (PRU -2.9%), E*Trade (ETFC -1.5%), Schwab (SCHW -1.2%).ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, BTO, IYG, FNCL, SEF, FXO, RYF, FINU, RWW, XLFS, FINZ, JHMF, FAZZ, FNCF

Free speech in explaining credit card fees
There is a lively argument going on at the Supreme Court - with justices considering how the First Amendment applies to credit card fees.At issue is a dispute over the "freedom of speech" for merchants, who want to avoid charges by steering customers toward cash, and payment companies, which seek to make the fees invisible.But New York law, similar to ones in nine other states, bars credit card "surcharges," while permitting "cash discounts."Related tickers: AXP, BAC, C, COF, DFS, JPM, MA, V

Citi downgrades Goldman to Sell
Yes, higher interest rates should boost Goldman's (NYSE:GS) trading business, says analyst Keith Horowitz, but the path is "relatively uncertain and the bar is relatively higher" given the bank's near-40% move since the election.He downgrades to Sell from Neutral. The $225 price target suggests 6% downside.Also downgraded to Sell is Comerica (NYSE:CMA) after its 80% Y/Y advance. Horowitz retains Buy ratings on Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC)Source: TheFlyGoldman is lower by 0.77% premarket.

BofA sued by FDIC over deposit insurance payments
According to the agency, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) ignored FDIC instructions over how to account for counterparty exposure.The FDIC sued the bank for at least $542M in payments for the last three quarters of 2013 and all of 2014. The total could go higher as the FDIC contends BofA owes more than $1B going back to 2011.It's a technical disagreement, says the bank, and the amounts being talked about are a fraction what's paid annually to the agency.This is likely to get resolved with a payment to the FDIC, says KBW's Brian Kleinhanzi, and it could impact book value by as much as $0.06 if the final charge is close to $1B.

Financials sink alongside rates and retail
The S&P 500 is lower by just 0.3%, but the financial sector (XLF -1.9%) is taking a sizable breather from its big post-election run.Those buying on hopes for the long-awaited sustained rise in interest rates might be pausing as the 10-year yield sinks seven basis points to 2.37%. Two weeks ago, it was at 2.60%.Bond bears have at least a couple of excuses to lighten up today. One might be softer-than-hoped jobs numbers from ADP. Or maybe economy bulls are mulling the carnage in retail (XRT -3.2%) - unless you happen to be Amazon (+2.3%) - following guidance, job, and store cuts at Macy's, and another 150 closings at Sears, as well as weak numbers from players like Kohl's.Bank of America (BAC -2.6%), Citigroup (C -2.3%), Wells Fargo (WFC -2.8%), JPMorgan (JPM -1.9%), Morgan Stanley (MS -3.1%), Regions Financial (RF -2.6%), U.S. Bancorp (USB -1.9%), KeyCorp (KEY -1.7%), Fifth Third (FITB -2.9%), Schwab (SCHW -1.5%), MetLife (MET -2.4%), AIG (AIG -1.4%)

Nomura reshuffles brokerage ratings after post-election rally
The post-election rally is notable for its "indiscriminate" buying of financial sector names, particularly large-caps, says Nomura's Steven Chubak. That's fine, he says, as it leaves "a very compelling" buying opportunity in a number of small- and mid-cap names which are set to be big winners under a Trump administration.He upgrades Raymond James Financial (RJF +1.6%) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD +1.4%) to Buy, and even suggests a pair trade of long Stifel (NYSE:SF) and Raymond James vs. a short in LPL Financial (LPLA -0.4%).Cut are made to Lazard (LAZ -1.1%) and Greenhill (GHL -3.6%) as the Trump rally overlooks the headwinds of protectionism and financing costs.Turning to big-caps, Chubak is growing more cautious on M&A as he sees deal risks rising under Trump. He suggests a buy of Bank of America (BAC -0.8%) vs. a sale of Goldman Sachs (GS -0.2%).Source: Bloomberg

Barron's ranks the best and worst places for income-focused investors in a rising-rate world. In order of appeal:Depressed European stocks: "Valuations have gotten more reasonable and dividend yields are ample, especially relative to ultralow or even negative yields on European government bonds."U.S. electric utilities: "Their average yield of 3.6% is almost double that of the S&P 500. Utility dividends usually are secure, given regulated returns."U.S. dividend stocks: "Even after rallying in 2016, high dividend-paying stocks still look appealing."Junk bonds: "Junk yields still look good at an average of 6.3%. The interest-rate gap relative to Treasuries is still appealing at nearly 4.5%, but absolute yields are modest by historical standards."Munis: looking better after a disappointing 2016.REITs: "REITs now are on the inexpensive side of a fair-value range."Preferreds: "REITs now are on the inexpensive side of a fair-value range."Treasurys: "If Trump’s fiscal and economic policies prove inflationary, Treasuries are apt to suffer."Telecom: There may be better value in other high-yielding parts of the market.MLPs.

BofA's Moynihan: Companies are "friskier" since election
Mid-sized companies "are frisker, they're more active," Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan tells Bloomberg, noting some have been drawing on credit lines to invest in operations. "They feel better about the prospects of the regulatory environment and their businesses. They feel better about the possibility of final demand.”These things take time though, and Moynihan isn't expecting an immediate big boost to the economy in 2017. BofA sees about 2% GDP growth next year vs. what's expected to be about 1.6% in 2016.As for regulatory rollback under a Trump administration, Moynihan - whose time atop BofA has been spent cleaning up the mess from the last bubble - says if the Volcker rule were eliminated tomorrow, the bank wouldn't change what it does.

Bank of America bullish at Raymond James even after post-election run-up
Bank of America (BAC +2.2%) is upgraded to Outperform from Market Perform at Raymond James, even after the stock has gained 36% since election day thanks to higher interest rates and the hope that the Trump victory will create a less onerous regulatory environment for bank stocks.Why now? The firm says it views BofA as a general proxy for the health of the U.S. economy, and it "sees better days ahead" with the prospect of stronger economic growth and expected changes brought by the new administration.James also sees an outsized benefit for BofA relative to smaller banks from the potential for reduced regulatory burden, a reduction in corporate tax rates, and higher capital return.

Fed adopts bailout prevention rule, forcing big banks to issue more debt
The Fed votes to adopt a bailout prevention rule that will force big banks to issue substantial amounts of new long-term debt, largely upholding a draft issued early this year.Half of the eight largest U.S. banks would need to issue ~$70B in fresh debt or equity to satisfy the new Total Loss Absorbing Capacity standard, the Fed estimates.In all, the Fed says U.S. banks’ funding costs would increase by $680M-$2B annually, higher than the upper estimate of $1.5B in its October 2015 proposal.Fed officials do not identify the four banks that lack sufficient debt; Wells Fargo (WFC +1.6%) said in November it envisioned issuing at least an additional $29B in debt to satisfy the rule.Besides WFC, the banks expected to satisfy the new rule are JPMorgan Chase (JPM +1.9%), Bank of America (BAC +2.6%), Citigroup (C +1.6%), State Street (STT +1.1%), BNY Mellon (BK +1.4%), Morgan Stanley (MS +0.9%) and Goldman Sachs (GS +1.7%).

Morgan Stanley: Banks now growth stocks
The Republican sweep, with lower taxes, and deficit-led growth plans is a "major tailwind" for banks, says analyst Betsy Graseck in Morgan Stanley's 2017 outlook.The big banks should now be though of as "growth stocks," as they will outperform in a rising inflation environment.A "new age of bank EPS growth" is upon us, she says. noting favorites like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), BB&T (NYSE:BBT), PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC), Regions Financial (NYSE:RF), SunTrust (NYSE:STI), U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), Bank of New York (NYSE:BK), Northern Trust (NASDAQ:NTRS), State Street (NYSE:STT), AmEx (NYSE:AXP), Capital One (NYSE:COF), Discover (NYSE:DFS), and Synchrony (NYSE:SYF).Source: BloombergPreviously: BAML survey a warning sign for bank bull market (Dec. 13)Previously: Don't ring the register on bank stocks yet - Oppenheimer (Dec. 12)

Don't ring the register on bank stocks yet - Oppenheimer
Some numbers to start: From the bottom of the great credit scare at the start of the year, the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index rose 33% up to the election, topping the S&P 500 by a big 12% during that period. Since the election, bank stocks have outperformed by another 12%, lifting their relative P/E to 77% of the S&P 500 (from 60% at the Feb. bottom).Though it probably doesn't make sense to be as bullish today at fancier valuations, Oppenheimer's Chris Kotwoski would still "let the bet ride.""Goldilocks" is a phrase that hasn't been mentioned much since The Maestro ran the Fed, but Kotowski drags it out, and says it could be applicable in 2017-18, with credit costs staying low, expenses tamped down, and revenues set to get a lift.His favorites names: Bank of America (BAC -2.2%), Citigroup (C -1.9%), CIT Group (CIT -1.6%), and Goldman Sachs (GS -2.2%)ETFs: KBE, KRE

BAML gets more serious about cross-selling - WSJ
Cross-selling may a dirty word at the moment thanks to the Wells Fargo fraud, but pressure on the big banks to show growth isn't going anywhere.The WSJ reports Merrill Lynch will require each of its thundering herd to make at least two client referrals to other parts of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), or face a 1% pay cut.Unlike Wells, which pressed employees for actual account openings, Merrill is requesting only "referrals."Merrill brokers likely will not complain as the 2017 pay grid is unchanged from 2016 (other than for this possible penalty) versus 2016 when certain grid thresholds were raised.

Buy any dip in bank stocks - Morgan Stanley
After a three standard deviation move in large-cap bank stocks, it seems logical to think about heading to the sidelines, says analyst Betsy Graseck. But should the names pull back, she recommends adding to positions as the bull case still outweighs the bear case next year.Using base case 2018 estimates and a target P/E of 12x implies 14% upside for Morgan's eight Overweight-rated stocks. The bull case on 2018 estimates with the same target P/E means upside of 41%.Top picks are Citigroup (NYSE:C), Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) on stronger capital returns; Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) on higher rates and lower expenses; Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on rising market volatility and improving VAR productivity; JPMorgan and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) on stronger loan growth and expense management; Capital One (NYSE:COF) and Discover (NYSE:DFS) on rising consumer leverage and higher capital return.

Financial sector midday report: Surge continues
The FRBNY's William Dudley isn't concerned about the post-election jump in rates at the long end of the curve, and says the Fed is about to start following suit at the short end.Even the dovish Charles Evans from the Chicago Fed admits inflation is getting closer to the central bank's target, and the labor market is close to full employment.The 10-year Treasury yield had moved as high as 2.45%, but has pulled back to 2.40%, still up 1.5 basis points on the session.On the regulatory front, Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo on Friday set himself up as the chief defender of the current bank regulatory regime, but whether his voice will be heard is a different story given the incoming administration, which looks to be staffed with those favoring a far lighter regulatory hand.Financial sector stocks today are about doubling the S&P 500's 0.5% advance.TBTF banks: Bank of America (BAC +2.3%), Citigroup (C +1.8%), JPMorgan (JPM +1.3%), Wells Fargo (WFC +0.9%), Goldman Sachs (GS +1.7%), Morgan Stanley (MS +0.4%)Regional lenders: U.S. Bancorp (USB +0.7%), PNC Financial (PNC +0.4%), KeyCorp (KEY -0.8%), Fifth Third (FITB +0.5%)Insurers: MetLife (MET +0.3%), Lincoln National (LNC), AIG (AIG +0.2%)Brokerage: Schwab (SCHW +0.9%), E*Trade (ETFC +0.9%)Custodial banks: State Street (STT +0.5%), Northern Trust (NTRS +1%)Private equity: Blackstone (BX +0.9%), KKR (KKR +1%)Asset Management: BlackRock (BLK +0.1%), Franklin Resources (BEN +0.5%), Affiliated Managers (AMG +1.8%)

Banks continue surge on higher rates, lower regulation
There are multi-year highs again across the sector as interest rates continue to rise, but, maybe more importantly, bank investors begin to envision a far less heavy regulatory burden.In a speech Friday described by FBR's Ed Mills as "going out swinging," Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo set himself up as the chief defender of the status quo, saying he doesn't see a "sound economic case" for rolling back the post-crisis regulatory regime.Whether anyone hears him much going forward is a different story, given names like former BB&T boss John Allison or former FDIC chief Thomas Hoenig being thrown around as possible Fed vice chairmen for bank supervision. Both Allison and Hoenig are fans of following simple leverage ratios, but Tarullo says just focusing on those is "inadequate and dangerous."Tarullo's voice will also have to rise above that of Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum led by Blackstone's Stephen Schwarzman.XLF +1.15%, KRE +1.1%, KBE +1.25%Bank of America (BAC +2.6%), Wells Fargo (WFC +1.4%), JPMorgan (JPM +1.6%), Citigroup (C +2.3%), Goldman Sachs (GS +2.1%), U.S. Bancorp (USB +1%), Regions Financial (RF +1.5%), Synovus (SNV +1.1%), SunTrust (STI +1.4%), Primerica (PRI +2.1%), Bank of New York (BNY +1.4%), State Street (STT +1.1%)

KBE +2.15%, KRE +2%.Bank of America (BAC +3%), Citigroup (C +1.7%), JPMorgan (JPM +2.2%), MetLife (MET +2.2%), Voya Financial (VOYA +3.3%), Northern Trust (NTRS +3.5%).Oil is now ahead 4.6% to $51.72, helping the XLE to another 2.1% advance.Tech (QQQ -1.4%) continues to struggle. Its decline today puts it lower by 1.1% since the election vs. the S&P's 2.8% advance, a 10% gain for the XLE, and a 14.5% move for the XLF.

Banks back in the lead as new Treasury chief has Dodd-Frank in sights
While the pick of ex-Goldmanite and Hollywood player Steven Mnuchin for Treasury Secretary can hardly be called "draining the swamp," Pantheon's Ian Shepherdson says it should make Wall Street happy.In his first public comments after being selected, Mnuchin promised to "kill" swaths of Dodd-Frank.Also making Wall Street (and other bankers/insurers/brokers) happy today is another big move higher in interest rates, with the 10-year Treasury yield up 10 basis points to 2.394%.The S&P 500 is just marginally higher, but the KBE is ahead 1.9%, and the KRE 2%.

BofA and Goldman have room to run - KBW
More confidence that rates are rising for real this time, "wide-sweeping" regulatory changes to come, and a better FICC environment have analyst Brian Kleinhanzi upgrading Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS +0.9%) to Outperform from Market Perform.Kleinhanzi keeps JPMorgan (JPM +0.8%) and Bank of New York (BK +0.2%) at Outperform.Turning to regional banks, KBW boosts its estimates for 2017 and 2018 for the large players, and upgrades Citizens Financial (CFG +1.9%) and Comerica (CMA +1.6%) to Outperform, while downgrading KeyCorp (KEY +0.3%) and PNC (PNC -0.2%) to Market Perform. The switch comes as KBW turns its focus on those lenders best positioned for a rising rate environment, and from regulatory relief, not to mention other levers should rates not rise.Source: Bloomberg

Goldman's list of stock longs mattering most to hedge funds
Looking at the top 50 hedge fund hotels, it's probably little surprise that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) top the list, with Amazon making for a top 10 holding in 61 funds, and Facebook in 57.Rounding out the top 10 are Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO), Allergan (NYSE:AGN), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Priceline (NASDAQ:PCLN).Looking at another gauge - the percent of market cap owned by hedge funds - shows CommScope (NASDAQ:COMM) leading the way, with hedge funds owning 37%. Next is Dell Technologies (NYSE:DVMT) and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) at 30%, and after that: Liberty Broadband (NASDAQ:LBRDK) at 24%, LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) at 21%, Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) at 20%, and Humana (NYSE:HUM) and WhiteWave Foods (NYSE:WWAV) at 19%.Previously: Goldman's list of shorts mattering most to hedge funds (Nov. 22)

Another valuation-related downgrade for BofA
“Take profits and selectively reduce exposure,” says Baird's David George, pulling his Outperform rating on Bank of America (BAC -1.9%) after the stock blasted through his $17 price target.BofA is higher by nearly 20% since the election, and by more than 60% since late June.The rally over the last few sessions alone has priced in higher rates, lower taxes, and more aggressive capital return, he says, and he advises investors to wait and actually see if structural improvement in macro trends actually materializes.George also cuts Capital One (COF -2.9%) to Neutral from Outperform, and Fifth Third (FITB -3%) to Underperform from Neutral.Previously: Sell-side takes profits on banks (Nov. 16)

GOP sweep propels bank stocks, JPMorgan and BofA hit 52-week highs
Banking stocks are ripping solid gains on the heels of the Republican party taking the White House and retaining control of Congress.

AT&T: $40B bridge loan to help finance TWX deal, and no rush otherwise
To finance its $85B deal for Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) -- half of which is coming in cash -- AT&T's (NYSE:T) invited its "relationship banks" to join a $40B bridge loan, at around three ticket levels, Bloomberg reports.Based on ratings of Baa1/BBB+ (and AT&T's ratings are on negative watch at the credit rating firms), the loan pricing may open at L+112.5 basis points, with a 10 bp commitment fee, and upfront fees of 20-30 bps.The company has BofA Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) on board to help finance the deal, though a $30B bond to help fund the deal won't be rushed as doubts remain about whether it will be completed.There's no reason to finance early given that ambiguity, a senior banker says. CreditSight analysts: "The merger may ultimately not be approved ... we feel the odds are around 50/50 at this stage."Some three-quarters of the financing is expected to take place in the investment-grade market. And doing the deal now rather than waiting for more regulatory certainty could end up more expensive for AT&T. Oct. 28, 2016, 7:06 PM | 17 Comments

UBS: BofA seems on way to being most conservative bank
That sounds like a good think for when the next downturn arrives, says analyst Brennan Hawken, but it also likely holds back growth in the near term vs. peers who are expanding that credit bucket (priced accordingly ... hopefully)."While we understand the capital and regulatory implications of reducing risk in the Markets and Banking businesses, it remains unclear if Bank of America (BAC +1%) might be missing out on the potential to pick up some market share as certain competitors retrench."

BofA slips into red despite earnings beat
The bank's strong Q3 may have already been discounted by the market, which sent BAC higher by 17% over the past three months. Strong trading results were reported by JPMorgan and Citigroup on Friday, so few were surprised when BofA showed the same this morning (Global Markets net income rose 34% Y/Y).As for deposits and lending, average total deposits rose 6% Y/Y, and average total loans and leases gained 3%. Net interest income edged higher, with net interest yield up 4 basis points from a year ago and flat from last quarter at 2.23%. The banks says a 100 basis point parallel shift in interest rates would benefit NII by $5.3B over the next 12 months - no small amount given $10.2B of NII in Q3, and overall Q3 income of $5B.See earnings call presentation slidesWhile credit loss provisions rose from year-ago levels, they were off nicely from Q1 and Q2.Noninterest expense fell to $13.5B in Q3 from $13.9B a year ago, with personnel costs down 2% and non-personnel costs off 5%. FTE headcount fell 3% Y/Y to 209K. Litigation expense of $250M in Q3 vs. $231M a year ago.Reporting from the earnings call, Charlotte Business Journal's Hilary Burns quotes CEO Brian Moynihan getting a small dig in on Wells Fargo: "'It's not about the number products we open it's whether customers want and need products we are offering them."Asked whether there will be shareholder pressure to separate the CEO/Chairman roles given the Wells Fargo scandal, Moynihan reminds that the bank's owners voted not to do so a year ago.The stock has given up early gains, now down 0.25%.Previously: Bank of America up 1% premarket after strong quarter (Oct. 17)

Credit card wars could crimp banks
Customers of offerings like JPMorgan's (NYSE:JPM) Sapphire Reserve card can't believe their good fortune, but bank shareholders can't be faulted for wondering whether there's going to be any profits from the growing rewards war."You have five or six big national players and they are going around killing one another," says Oppenheimer's Chris Kotowski.It's the banking version of a loss leader. The upfront rewards are well above the annual fee, but if customers hold onto the card after the first year, and better yet hold a balance, they could become profitable."It has been a huge success," says the bank's card boss, Kevin Watters. Speaking on Friday's earnings call, CFO Marianne Lake declined to say how much card debt customers need to take on before a profit can be turned.Citigroup's (NYSE:C) spending on cards has also been aggressive, but personal finance gurus say its Prestige premium card needs to up its rewards game to compete with JPMorgan's offering.Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) also naturally want to boost card business, but until now have mostly refrained from joining the war, and earlier this month, American Express (NYSE:AXP) boosted rewards on its Platinum card, though saying publicly the move wasn't in response to JPMorgan and Citi.

Merrill Lynch to end commission-based options for retirement accounts
Looking to comply Washington's so-called fiduciary rule, Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) tells its more than 14K-strong thundering herd that after April 10, investors with retirement accounts will no longer have the option of paying commissions, but will instead have to pay a fee based on their assets.Merrill is the first brokerage to eliminate the commission-option for clients, but it may be paving the way for rivals like Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) to do the same.LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) has said it will still offer some sort of commission-based option to retirement savers.Source: Michael Wursthorn in the WSJ

ECB "taper" chatter sends rates and financials higher
A Bloomberg report says the ECB is likely to gradually wind down bond purchases ahead of the scheduled March 2017 end of its QE program. The central bank is currently buying €80B per month of government and corporate paper, and may begin to slow that amount by €10B per month, according to the story.Yields are higher in Europe and the U.S., with the 10-year U.S. Treasury up five basis points to 1.675% and the German 10-year Bund yield is up four bps to -0.048%.

Latest stress test changes bad news for TBTFs, good news for smaller players
"Large banks are going to be forced to take on more capital," says Dick Bove. "It will make the cost of funding more, not less, expensive. It will reduce the appeal for investors to put money at risk in the banking system."Bove is commenting on a weekend announcement from Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo promising future stress tests will be geared to demanding even higher cash buffers for banks. Set to take effect next year, the new rule could raise capital requirements for the largest banks by 3 or 4 percentage points, writes Jeff Cox at CNBC.Interested parties: BAC, C, WFC, JPM, GS, MSThere's good news though, as those lenders with less than $250B in assets won't be subject to the same standards.

Either bank stocks are easy money or the market is set for a fall
"How can a market trading for 17-18x forward earnings be anchored to a financial system that only merits a 12-13x multiple," asks Convergex's Nicholas Colas. "Why should U.S. equities overall be up 5-12% and banks stocks only flat on the year?"Checking back to other times when broader markets diverged from the financial sector - 2000 and 2007 come to mind - Colas finds the resolution didn't work out too well. The bottom line, says Colas: Either bank stocks like JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of American (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C) are a slam-dunk buy headed into the end of the year, or the markets are about to have a serious problem.

Reuters: BofA cutting Asia investment banking jobs
Responding to the slowdown in business in Asia, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is set to cut about two dozen investment banking jobs in the region, including those f some top rainmakers, reports Reuters.The news follows a report last week of Goldman Sachs set to slash about 30% of its investment banking jobs in Asia (ex-Japan).A BofA spokesman says the cuts account for just a small portion of its total Asia corporate and investment banking operation, and are part of an annual trimming of costs.

Accounting change at BofA should smooth impact of rate swings
The change has to do with how Bank of America (BAC -0.5%) accounts for some MBS it owns, and brings its accounting inline with many of its peers.The bank's previous method boosted reported net interest income in times of rising rates, but cut it when rates fell. The new method will smooth that.In Q2, for instance, writes the WSJ's Michael Rapoport, BofA said pretax earnings were reduced by $974M thanks to "market-related adjustments" as long rates fell. A year earlier, those adjustments added $669M because rates rose.Under the new rules, those costs will be accounted for over the lives of the securities (the way most banks already do it) and the "market-related adjustments" line will go away.SEC Form 8-K Sep. 23, 2016, 3:20 PM | 2 Comments
Fed moves forward with bank commodity restrictions
The proposed rule would make it more difficult for banks to be involved with physical commodities by raising capital requirements. Further, banks would be prohibited from activities involving power plants, and owning or storing copper.The Fed today begins a 90-day period of accepting public comment.Banks like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) have relied on grandfather clauses to engage in physical commodity businesses not allowed for other lenders, while Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) remain somewhat involved in commodity trading and energy tolling activities.ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, BTO, IYG, FNCL, SEF, FXO, RYF, FINU, RWW, XLFS, FINZ, JHMF, FAZZ, FNCF Sep. 23, 2016, 12:05 PM | 11 Comments
Deutsche: For outlook on Wells Fargo, look to other bank scandals
Analyst Matt O'Connor checked the price action on Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) after its $4B accounting error caused a retroactive failure in the CCAR, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) after the London whale trading loss, and M&T Bank (NYSE:MTB) after regulators found "significant weakness" in risk management.He produced this chart which shows the median average selloff (both absolutely and relative to peers). Bottom line, says O'Connor: Wells' (NYSE:WFC) decline relative to the KBW Bank Index is about 50% done.He maintains his Buy rating and $59 price target.WFC is lower by another 2.1% today to $45.55, while the rest of the banking sector is modestly higher.

Six financials to buy on rate hike - Goldman
It's no surprise that yield-starved financials are expected to be a big beneficiary of higher base rates, but the team at Goldman has six that stand to gain the most.Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK), Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG), Regions Financial (NYSE:RF), Schwab (NYSE:SCHW), and Zions Bancorp (NASDAQ:ZION) make the cut.Goldman sees an average 46% upside to normalized earnings for the group if rates go back to 3% (a long way off for even the most hawkish).Used to low and slow as far as rate hikes go, investors may be overlooking the potential for even one Fed move this year to be a positive catalyst. The team suggests taking a look at 6-month and 12-month calls on their recommendation list. Sep. 14, 2016, 11:03 AM | 14 Comments
Wells Fargo scam a problem for all the big banks - Cowen
The head of the CFPB was on the tape earlier saying the Wells Fargo (WFC -3.1%) account opening case isn't a signal of a broader problem in the industry, but Cowen's Jaret Seiberg says not to underestimate the political risk to the likes of Wells, Bank of America (BAC -1.8%), Citigroup (C -1.9%), and JPMorgan (JPM -1.2%). With extra ammunition given to the "break up the banks crowd," this is no longer a negligible risk.Wells Fargo has enjoyed special status compared to the other mega banks since the financial crisis, says Seiberg, but "life [is] about to get worse" for Warren Buffett's favorite. The bank, says Seiberg, will no longer get the benefit of the doubt. "[The] fall from golden child to problem child can be difficult and expensive."The Senate Banking Committee is set to hold a hearing on the Wells Fargo matter on Sept. 20.As for the industry as a whole, Treasury Sec. Jack Lew took to the Delivering Alpha conference this morning to wag a finger and say 'I told you so,' to those who complain about Dodd-Frank and over-regulation of banks, in general.

No evidence of WFC problems at other banks
Despite the penalties imposed on Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), there is probably no broader problem in the U.S. banking industry over abusive sales practices, according to the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Regulators fined the company a total of $185M last Thursday, while Moody's warned the episode would negatively affect the bank's debt. Wells paid another $5M to customers for creating more than 2M fake accounts.Related tickers: JPM, C, BAC, MS, USB, COF, FITB, TD, PNC, STI Sep. 13, 2016, 2:09 AM | 32 Comments
Wells Fargo penalty a warning for entire industry
Wells Fargo (WFC -0.7%) yesterday was fined $185M over its employees opening millions of fraudulent deposit and credit card accounts in order to meet sales targets and collect bonuses. The bank has fired 5.3K over improper practices.Over at Rafferty, Dick Bove downgrades Warren Buffett's ([BRK.A]], BRK.B) favorite bank, calling it a "very big problem," that's caused "significant" damage to Wells' business model.While "cross-selling" is something most lenders try to do, Wells Fargo has built its brand around this theme more than its peers. The charges, says Bove, reopens the question about whether customers can trust their banks and to whether another wave of regulation is needed.Compass Point's Isaac Boltansky says the news is "bigger than WFC" and should be viewed as "clear, undeniable warnings" to the entire industry on cross-selling. The bit firmly between its teeth now, look for more enforcement actions from the CFPB.Similar thoughts are hitting the tape from Sandler O'Neill, Evercore ISI, and RBC.Interested parties include: BAC, JPM, C ETFs: KBE, KRE Sep. 9, 2016, 10:37 AM | 135 Comments

WSJ: Banks mull legal challenge to stress tests
The Fed stress tests are the centerpiece of post-crisis bank regulatory reform, and that the banks would even consider challenging a bureaucracy that's not in the habit of being challenged is a shocker. The WSJ, however, reports bank trade groups and industry advisers are debating just that, but say talks are still in an early stage.Fans of Dodd-Frank will naturally argue the stress tests have made the banks far safer, but at what expense to investors? A main area of contention is the opacity of the tests, says the report, as well as the ability of regulators to block returns for subjective reasons (such as challenging them?).Perhaps lenders are feeling their oats following MetLife's successful challenge of its SIFI designation. If the insurer can take on Uncle Sam and win, why not the banks?Interested parties are too numerous to name, but include: Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Citigroup (NYSE:C), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).ETFs: KBE, KRE

WSJ: BofA as activist target?
The conventional wisdom says activists typically shy away from the big banks as the heavy regulatory burden makes it difficult make an impact on strategy.ValueAct Capital shook up that thinking this week with the disclosure of its $1.15B stake in Morgan Stanley. Now, according to Christina Rexrode at the WSJ, some frustrated investors have reached out to activists - ValueAct included - to gauge interest in targeting Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).While some of the activists had interest, the bank's size might make it too expensive to build a stake large enough to have influence. ValueAct was able to buy about 2% of Morgan Stanley with its $1.15B, but taking a similarly-sized stake in BofA would cost roughly $3B.

Deutsche: BofA a better bet than JPMorgan
It's a switch for Matt O'Connor and team, who up until now have preferred JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). The Bank of Dimon, however, has outperformed Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) by a full 1,100 basis points this year, making BofA's valuation enticing.There's more though, as BofA has more in the way of expense cuts ahead of it, not to mention less consumer credit risk thanks to its higher FICO customers.Back to valuation: Bank of America trades at a 12% discount to JPMorgan based on 2017 estimates. The discount seems warranted given JPM's historically better execution and more stable earnings. If BofA can deliver on its cost-cutting targets, says O'Connor, there's potential for this discount to narrow. Jul. 28, 2016, 2:04 PM | 24 Comments
Oppenheimer: Bank stock hatred hits new highs
Having covered bank stocks on and off since 1985, the team at Oppenheimer says portfolio managers have never been fans of the sector, but the hatred today is off the charts - even as the reasons for that hatred have gone away.Banks used to be opaque, they overpaid for acquisitions, and often had frothy growth that almost invariably backfired. It's hard to say that today. While banks will always be somewhat opaque, today they're returning capital rather than blowing it on acquisitions, and their "growth initiatives are the epitome of financial probity."Oppenheimer's six large bank composite has on average churned out quarterly pretax earnings of $31.4B per quarter since 2013 (including $30.5B in Q1 this year, and $33.4B in Q2). That's a lot of money, especially since most of it is being used to buy back stock at less than 10x earnings and below tangible book value.While lower-for-longer interest rates will continue to hamper earnings, banks are managing appropriately for the current environment, and the math of buying back stock below book will eventually win the day.Favorite picks are Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).ETFs: KBE, KRE Jul. 27, 2016, 11:49 AM | 20 Comments

BofA up nearly 2% after Q2 results; sell-side weighs in
Citi's Keith Horowitz notes 3% revenue growth in Q2 represents the best quarter for that metric since Q4 of 2012. Core expenses fell on a year-over-year basis for the 17th consecutive quarter.While it was a "noisy" quarter, Nomura's Steven Chubak notes fee income and the efficiency ratio were positive surprises, while core net interest income and credit costs were inline. This quarter's resetting of interest rate expectations (lower for longer) and curve flattening could put a damper on any positive EPS estimates for H2 and 2017, but Chubak suspects the stock price at 82% of tangible book value has already discounted this.Speaking on the earnings call, CEO Brian Moynihan says Bank of America (BAC +1.9%) doesn't need higher interest rates to grow earnings.

Banks and insurers cheap for a reason
While nearly all major U.S. banks cruised through the stress tests last month, writes David Schawel, those exams are about determining if lenders have enough capital to get through a crisis, not whether they can earn the sort of risk-adjusted returns of the past.On this front (for insurers as well as banks), there's plenty more for investors to worry about, he says, thanks to the vanishing spread between short rates (what the companies pay on their liabilities), and long rates (what they earn on their assets).A new Fed study finds the adverse effect of weaker net interest margins is materially larger when rates are low. The reason: The lower bound of funding costs is zero as institutions are reticent to charge negative rates.Investors interested in buying banks or insurers because of seemingly cheap valuations might want to look again. Bank multiples, says Schawel, typically move alongside ROE, and serious improvement in ROE is unlikely with rates remaining low.Interested parties include: BAC, C, JPM, WFC, MET, PRU, LNC, PNC, USB, RF, KEY, KRE, KBE Jul. 11, 2016, 3:40 PM | 135 Comments

Big banks show little reaction to capital plans
Dividend increases and boosted buybacks must already have been priced into the shares of the big banks, as share prices are showing little reaction to last night's capital plans.Citigroup (C -0.6%) is notably lower despite announcing more than a tripling in the dividend. Bank of America (BAC -0.8%) was more cautious with its payout boost, but is faring about the same. JPMorgan (JPM unch) chose not to lift its dividend, but did raise the buyback. Morgan Stanley (MS +0.6%) lifted both. Wells Fargo (WFC -0.5%) didn't give details other than saying its capital plan was approved; same for Goldman Sachs (GS +0.1%).ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, BTO, IYG, FNCL, SEF, FXO, RYF, FINU, RWW, XLFS, FINZ, JHMF, FAZZ, FNCF, KBE Jun. 30, 2016, 10:51 AM | 23 Comments

Consumers' improving credit good news for banks
The percentage of Americans with subprime credit scores fell to 20.7% in April, the sixth consecutive year-over-year decline, and the lowest level since at least 2005 when FICO started tracking the data.The level peaked at 25.5% in 2010.The improving trend means revenue-squeezed banks can boost lending without lowering standards. "It will have a positive impact on loan volume, loan growth and revenue,” says Morgan Whitacre, a consumer client underwriting executive at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).Alongside rising credit scores are near-record lows for defaults. Just 0.81% of consumer loan dollars - including mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards - were in default in May, the lowest level on records going back to 2004. This peaked at 5.51% in 2009.The result: Consumers are starting to borrow more again ... a good thing until it isn't anymore. Jamie Dimon (NYSE:JPM) earlier in June called the auto-lending market "a little stretched," and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) just lifted its forecast for credit losses in the coming year.Source: Annamaria Andriotis at the WSJ Jun. 22, 2016, 8:39 AM | 6 Comments

Banks mull strong Jefferies trading results
Jefferies' fiscal quarters end one month ahead of those for JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), so investors in those banks like to keep an eye out in order to get a preview.What they'll get from Jefferies' FQ2 is that fixed-income trading has experienced a sharp reversal to the upside after a lame Q1. Bond-trading revenue at Jefferies was up 55%, the largest quarterly gain since 2014, and the best Mar-May quarter since 2012. Wall Street executives for a few weeks have touted a Q2 trading rebound, and the news from Jefferies backs that up.On the downside, stock and bond underwriting income continued to slump.

FT: Thousands more retail jobs going at BofA
Thank the digital banking revolution reducing the need for teller and back-office jobs. According to the FT, another 8K retail jobs are set to go at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), though the lender will be adding sales staff - loan officers, small business bankers, and personal investment advisors.Even with those additions, headcount is expected to shrink by several thousand amid a steady drop in the number of customers visiting branches. According to the report, the cuts are mostly to come from attrition rather than outright layoffs.The bank has already cut nearly 40K jobs from its consumer division since 2009, bringing headcount down to about 68.4K at the end of Q1. Speaking at a conference this week, Thong Nguyen, head of retail banking, told an audience to expect that number to get to the low 60s.

BofA's Moynihan: Stress tests likely cutting lending
Speaking at conference in D.C. last night, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan said publicly what is strikingly obvious: That the stress tests are probably forcing banks to restrict lending."If you think of any business decision you’re going to make, you’d have to assume that the business decision was going to go wrong at the worst possible time and hold capital ... That's the stress test.""Over the next 10 to 15 years, people will ask whether we got it right," says Moynihan, speaking about banks' boosted capital requirements.

BofA top bank idea at Baird
Not very excited about the prospects for bank stocks given the significant flattening in the yield curve as potentially signaling a deteriorating H2 and 2017 environment, a bank stock analyst nevertheless needs to recommend bank stocks.Given low expectations as reflected in its cheap valuation, its highly asset-sensitive balance sheet, and the chance for good news from CCAR, Bank of America (BAC -1.3%) is the team's top bank idea.Looking at regionals, they like the M&A optionality in Comerica (CMA -1.1%), but don't see much value in names like Citizens Financial Group (CFG -1.1%), Regions Financial (RF -1.1%), SunTrust (STI -0.9%), and Zions Bancorp (ZION -0.9%). Baird also sticks with its Underperform rating on M&T Bank (MTB +0.3%), which trades at 13.5x 2017E EPS vs. about 11x for the peer group. Jun. 13, 2016, 2:25 PM | 21 Comments

The Dodd Frank stress test (DFAST) results are due on June 23 and the Comprehensive Capital Analysis (CCAR) on June 29.Noting a severely adverse scenario even more rigorous than in the past, Morningstar's Dan Werner says it will be hard to read anything negative into a bank's passing the test.Barclay's Jason Goldberg points out Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) as two poised to thrive if the government were to allow them to draw down capital, but "when" is the big question as next year's tests are expected to be even harder. The two are trading at about 1x book and sport ROEs of roughly 10% - both gauges were about twice those amounts prior to the financial crisis.JPMorgan's Kian Abouhossein expects Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and SunTrust (NYSE:STI) to have outsized increases in capital return this year, driven mostly by buybacks.One wild card: This year's tests requires banks to model for negative interest rates.

Wells Fargo's growth machine sputters
"It's a machine, no doubt about it," says one getting disgruntled customer of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), which is one of only two U.S. companies which have produced at least $5B of net income in each of the last 14 quarters (Apple is the other).Worrying analysts though is that customers like the one above - his family has nine Wells products - appear to have had their fill, writes Ben McLannahan in the FT. Wells' lauded cross-sell ratio has fallen from an average of 6.36 products per household in Dec. 2013 to 6.29 a the end of last year."While the bank trades at a premium to U.S. peers in terms of multiple of net assets, that premium has shrunk to half the level of two years ago, and Wells recently cut some financial targets.Without a big rise in interest rates, says Standard Life's Chris Haimendorf, "it is very difficult to see how things can get even better from here."CEO John Stumpf - though acknowledging the low-rate issue - says there are plenty of avenues for growth. He notes peers like BofA (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C) closing branches or even pulling out of certain cities. Wells, on the other hand, is keeping its footprint, but adjusting its format with smaller "bodega branches."Stumpf: “All of our new account acquisition happens at one of our branches. If you shut that down, at least today, you shut down your front engine." Jun. 6, 2016, 3:28 PM | 34 Comments

Bank capital requirements to get tougher
In separate public comments today, Fed governors Daniel Tarullo and Jerome Powell said the Fed will require the eight largest U.S. banks to hold even more capital if they want to pass stress tests.The goal, says Powell, is to make capital requirements so difficult that the largest lenders have to honestly assess whether it would be a better idea to break themselves up.For now, the Fed is going to make 2015's capital surcharges permanent, which alone makes things tougher. "Really quite significant, probably the most significant additional potential capital requirement on the horizon." says former OCC Director John Dugan.The eight: Bank of America (BAC -0.1%), Citigroup (C -0.3%), JPMorgan (JPM -0.4%), Morgan Stanley (MS -0.7%), Wells Fargo (WFC -0.5%), State Street (STT -0.7%), Goldman Sachs (GS -0.7%), BNY Mellon (BK -0.5%) Jun. 2, 2016, 11:24 AM | 107 Comments

Banks up the risk with block trades
About half of all share sales by public companies this year have been block trades, writes Corrie Driebusch, versus an average of about one-third over the past five years, and just one-fifth over the past decade.To review, a block trade involves a bank buying a large chunk of stock from a company or its P-E backers at a discount, in the hopes of unloading it piece-by-piece later that day at a markup.The increase in block trades, of course, comes as business slows at any number of other bank profit centers, particularly fixed-income trading.For the most part, block deals have mostly proved profitable this year, with an average one-day return of 0.5%, according to Dealogic. The leaders in U.S. block trades this year are Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), with Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C) also notable participants.

If the suits are successful, the bill to banks could be several billion dollars.Roughly a dozen financial companies have already settled official charges of rate manipulation, with some pleading guilty to criminal charges.The defendants in line from today's ruling include: Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Barclays (NYSE:BCS), Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS), Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), HSBC, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Lloyds (NYSE:LYG), Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY), SocGen (OTCPK:SCGLY), UBS, and Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS).

Bank loan loss reserves up for first time in six years
"The days of negative provisioning are pretty much dead," says D.A. Davidson's Kevin Reevey. "Now, they're going to have to take provisioning expense and build up reserves based on loan growth."Total bank loan loss reserves were north of $250B in Q1 2010, before falling to about $24B at the end of last year. Amid the energy crash, they edged higher in Q1. Naturally, those lenders with the most exposure to energy posted some of the largest reserve increases in Q1. "It wasn't just the levels that [oil] went to, it was the speed at which prices dropped," says Peter Guilfoile, chief credit officer at one of those banks - Comerica (NYSE:CMA). Colorado-based National Bank Holdings (NYSE:NBHC) posted the largest Q/Q increase in reserves-to-loans, jumping 39 basis points to 1.43%.Meanwhile, there were plenty of other banks which actually saw declines in that ratio, notably Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB). These and other lenders in that bucket can thank denominator of that ratio growing quickly enough to offset reserve builds.Source: SNL Financial's Zach Fox and Venkatesh Iyer ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, KRE, UYG, VFH, KBE, IYF, BTO, IAT, IYG, FNCL, SEF, FXO, KBWB, QABA, KBWR, RYF, FINU, KRU, RWW, XLFS, FINZ, KRS, WDRW, DPST, FAZZ May 20, 2016, 12:11 PM | 15 Comments

New pay rules could give asset managers a leg up over banks
Sweeping new compensation rules released by six federal agencies last month would free up pay restrictions for the BlackRock's (NYSE:BLK) of the world, while tightening them for banks like JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).Source: Bloomberg The result is likely an even stronger flow of talent exodus from the big banks and to outfits like BlackRock, Vanguard, Pimco, and Fidelity, to name four.“They keep making it more difficult to be a big bank,” says a D.C. attorney.At those lenders with more than $250B in assets, top management would have 60% of their bonuses deferred for four years. Tough, but even tougher are clawback provisions allowing banks to take back money up to seven years after bonuses vest.Though mammoth in size, the overwhelming majority of assets at BlackRock and the like are client, not proprietary assets. Thus, they aren't subject to the same restrictions. Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN), for instance, has $743B in AUM, but only about $16B of its own assets. Blackstone (NYSE:BX) manages $344B, but only $22B of its own money. May 18, 2016, 11:12 AM | 32 Comments

She also accuses the bank of violating Dodd-Frank whistleblower protects by suspending her for complaining about illegal activity.Among the details: Her boss treated her "like a summer intern," spent more time with the other structured products chief, banned her from client events, and peppered her with questions like "have your eyes always been that blue?"As for illegal activity, she says her counterpart engaged in "front running" by buying bonds for BofA despite knowing clients wanted them.

JPMorgan keeps risk appetite as rivals pull back
Value-at-risk at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) jumped 50% amid Q1's volatility, reports Bloomberg. It's a figure standing in sharp contrast to declines of 25% or more at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Deutshce Bank (NYSE:DB), and smaller falls at UBS, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS).For Bank of America, it says the risk in its trading portfolio in Q1 was the lowest in any quarter since the Merrill Lynch merger in 2009.While cutting VaR reduces risk, it also limits profits, and in past times. notes a former Fed bank examiner turned college teacher, banks used episodes of higher volatility to step in and make money. In a Dodd-Frank world, making money in this fashion may not be received well by regulators. May 12, 2016, 12:33 PM | 5 Comments
Big banks settle U.S. rate-rigging lawsuit
Seven of the world's largest banks have agreed to pay $324M to settle a U.S. lawsuit accusing them of rigging the "ISDAfix" benchmark for their own gain from 2009 to 2012.The illegal deals included the execution of rapid trades just before the rate was set each day, called "banging the close," to delay transactions and post rates that did not reflect market activity.The settlement resolves claims against BofA (NYSE:BAC), Barclays (NYSE:BCS), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS), Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and the Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS).

BofA's issues: So obvious, even a 9th-grader can see them
What's the bank doing to get more efficient, asked 9th-grader Natalie Clarke of Bank of America (BAC -0.9%) CEO Brian Moynihan at the annual meeting this week. BofA, of course, has a notoriously high efficiency ratio (like in golf, high isn't good).Clarke is the owner of 5K shares of Bank of America given to her as a baby, and at previous annual meetings has queried about her father who got laid off and about pay for women. This year she got serious: "You and I are looking at some pretty bad numbers," she told Moynihan. BofA is about flat since Moynihan took over, and sells for just two-thirds of book value. Its 11% decline in 2016 stands against just a 3.5% fall in the KBW Bank Index, and is worse than its big bank peers.As for Clarke's holdings, she got her shares in 2002 when BofA was a $34 stock, more than double today's price.“There’s a perception that you guys shine your shoes, go to work and wait for interest rates to rise,” said the considerably older Mike Mayo at the meeting. Mayo later said Clarke's questions did a good job of summarizing the concerns of bank investors. Apr. 28, 2016, 3:17 PM | 72 Comments
BofA shareholders approve exec pay
In no surprise, Bank of America (BAC +0.1%) owners elected all 13 directors nominated by the bank, and approved compensation for top management.Also, no surprise, owners rejected a "clawback" proposal in which the bank could have held onto a substantial portion of the pay of executives for at least 10 years.Among the speakers was analyst Mike Mayo, who criticized the board's independent members for not holding CEO Brian Moynihan and team more accountable for hitting financial targets. He called the compensation proposal "extra pay for management."Mayo upgraded BofA to Outperform about three months ago, arguing the cheap valuation and strong balance sheet made the stock a buy despite poor corporate governance.Annual meeting webcast Apr. 27, 2016, 1:34 PM | 34 Comments
Goldman team still bullish on big banks
Having had some time to digest weak, but better-than-hoped Q1 results for the nation's largest lenders, Goldman analyst Richard Ramsden remains bullish on the likes of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).He notes NIMs expanded - meaning banks held onto most of the benefit from the Fed's December rate hike. Cost-cutting programs are beginning to bear fruit, with 9% Y/Y cuts in compensation costs, and 3% declines in non-comp expenses.As for energy, provisions made for a 9% drag on EPS, but reserves now stand at 6% of funded energy loans, or 11% of E&P oilfield service loans.Ramsden is looking for robust loan and deposit growth for the rest of this year.His favorite name is Bank of America with a $17 price target (vs. current $14.39). The stock trades at 10.5x 2016 earnings, but probably has the most sensitivity to higher rates, and the most core and non-core expense leverage. Apr. 19, 2016, 1:29 PM | 15 Comments
BofA turns higher following earnings and call
Living will: The fixes are "completely doable," says CFO Paul Donofrio, addressing yesterday's rejection of his bank's wind-down plan.Return on assets: ROA slipped to 0.5% in Q1 from 0.6% a quarter earlier - just half of CEO Brian Moynihan's goal of 1%. Moynihan tells callers interest rates will have to rise before that level can be reached.Mobile still growing fast: The bank in Q1 had 19.6M active users of its mobile banking services, up 15% from a year ago. 16% of deposits are now done through mobile devices. On branch cuts, management says they are consolidating into larger branches, and the new ones look more like a sales office than a traditional branch. Donofrio: “I think the branches are not going to be places where people come to transact. They’re going to come for a product they need because something changed in their life."Expenses: The efficiency ratio improved, but it's still a whopping 75% vs. peers in the mid-to-high 50s. Moynihan wants to at least get it down to the low-60s. Pressed on expenses by Mike Mayo, Donofrio says the bank is splitting cost savings between future growth and the bottom line.

Financials lead markets higher after JPMorgan results
JPMorgan's revenues and profits both fell from a year ago, but the lame performance of the banks thus far this year has already priced in a weak quarter. JPMorgan is higher by 3.8%, with Citigroup (C +4.7%), Bank of America (BAC +3.5%), Wells Fargo (WFC +1.7%), Goldman Sachs (GS +2.9%), and Morgan Stanley (MS +4.4%) joining the party. The XLF is higher by 1.75% vs. the S&P 500's 0.7% advance.But what about all of these players (except for Citi) having their living wills rejected by the Fed, FDIC, or both? A sideshow, no doubt. Regulators are going to regulate - like the commercial goes, "It's what they do." Banks will tweak plans, numbers, or whatever they need to in order to get D.C. to eventually sign off.ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, BTO, IAI, IYG, FNCL, SEF, FXO, RYF, KCE, FINU, RWW, XLFS, FINZ, FAZZ Apr. 13, 2016, 11:31 AM | 24 Comments
D.C. rejects living wills of most major banks
As leaked last night, regulators have sent so-called living wills by five major U.S. banks back to the drawing board. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK), and State Street (NYSE:STT) have until Oct. 1 to revise their plans or face potential penalties.Official announcementRegulators were split on Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), with the FDIC giving Goldman a thumbs down, but the Fed not, and just the opposite for Morgan.Citigroup (NYSE:C) is the only one of the major banks not to have their plan rejected, though both the Fed and FDIC found "shortcomings" that need to be addressed by July 2017.The next time you're thinking about complaining over some silly fee charged by your lender, have a thought for the armies of accountants, analysts, and lawyers the bank is paying to comply with D.C.'s whims.ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, BTO, IYG, FNCL, SEF, FXO, RYF, FINU, RWW, XLFS, FINZ, FAZZ Now read: Financials Are Set To Miss Already Lowered Earnings Estimates Apr. 13, 2016, 8:12 AM | 97 Comments
WSJ: Regulators to reject 'living wills' of some big banks
At least half of the eight U.S. banks labeled "systemically important" are expected to receive "harsh verdicts" regarding their so-called living wills, sending them scrambling to revise plans about how they would handle a potential bankruptcy, WSJ reports.The move, which could come as soon as this week, would raise the prospect of higher capital requirements or other regulatory sanctions for some of the institutions, and underscore fears that the firms remain "too big to fail" without a taxpayer bailout.Related tickers: BK, STT, BAC, JPM, C, GS, MS, WFC Apr. 13, 2016, 4:42 AM | 33 Comments
Banks will face questions on unfunded loans
“Let’s not sugarcoat it, this is not necessarily a loan a bank wants to make at this point,” says Evercore ISI's Glenn Schorr, talking about loans banks have committed to for energy companies, but upon which those firms have not yet drawn.In Q1, energy borrowers announced draws of more than $3B on these loans, saddling banks with maybe more exposure to the sector than they or their investors would like right now.Citigroup (NYSE:C), for example, has about $20B in funded energy loan exposure, but commitments for nearly another $40B. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has loans of just over $20B and commitments for another $20B-plus. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), SunTrust (NYSE:STI), Comerica (NYSE:CMA), Regions Financial (NYSE:RF), and KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) are showing similar stories (though mostly smaller amounts). Add it up, and there's $147B of unfunded loans disclosed by the ten of the largest U.S. banks.

Big bank breakups ... Some, more than others
Focusing on "too big to fail" is too narrow a lens with which to analyze and make decisions about bank size and concentration, says the team at KBW, taking note of increased chatter of late about a forced breakup of the nation's largest lenders.Returns are part of the mix too, and if they're poor at the mega-banks, this limits credit creation in the economy - a signal, says KBW, that companies must "radically restructure" to get their stock prices above at least tangible book value.Looking at the stock prices of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C) during the past five years, KBW says Wells has traded above TBV throughout the time period - suggesting the bank is consistently creating returns above its cost of capital. Citi, on the other hand, has not traded above TBV for the whole period - "a clear market signal that the company should consider much more radical restructuring to create profitable business that can grow."

Higher rates? Wait 'till next year
The 10-year Treasury yield at 1.69% has returned back to levels not seen since the panicky action in mid-February. And while the Fed has marked down its expectation of rate hikes this year to just two, short-term interest rate markets haven't even priced in one.This leaves those whose business model depends on riding the yield curve having to contend with not only a middling macro picture, but - once again - a rates lower for longer picture (although Jamie Dimon says his big fear is that markets aren't pricing in nearly enough in the way of higher rates).Citigroup (C -4.1%), Bank of America (BAC -3.3%), U.S. Bancorp (USB -2.8%), KeyCorp (KEY -3.4%), Regions Financial (RF -3.4%), BNY Mellon (BK -3.6%), E*Trade (ETFC -4.7%), Manulife (MFC -5.2%), Lincoln National (LNC -3.6%) Apr. 7, 2016, 3:09 PM | 13 Comments
Big banks: The CCAR submissions are in
"We are confident in the capital strength of the large and mid-cap banks - and with that, their capacity for increased capital returns," says Credit Suisse's Susan Roth Katzke.Stronger balance sheets, she says, should outweigh what is a harsher adverse scenario from the Fed.Roth and team see a total net capital return increase of 77% vs. 58% in 2015, with a median payout ratio of 31% vs. 27%. Incremental dollars should be skewed to buybacks given cheap stock valuations and the Fed's preference for the flexibility afforded by repurchases.Best positioned for the highest capital return are Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Regions Financial (NYSE:RF), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB), PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC), and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB).The highest incremental capital returns should come from Zions Bancorp (NASDAQ:ZION), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and M&T Bank (NYSE:MTB).The lower end of payout ratios should fall on Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN) and Bank of America.Now read: Sell The Banks: The Invisible Hand Is Broken (April 4) Apr. 7, 2016, 12:44 PM | 12 Comments
WSJ: Winners and losers from D.C.'s new retirement rules
The Department of Labor this week is expected to release final regulations requiring brokers to act with a fiduciary standard - that is act solely in the best interest of their client. Previously, recommendations only had to be "suitable" for clients - a less rigorous standard allowing excessive fees, and investments with hidden commissions.Investors now paying trading commissions will likely be moved into accounts where brokers collect fees based on AUM. Popular, but costly products like variable annuities, commodity pools and non-tradable REITs might no longer find a home in retirement accounts. They'll be replaced with low-cost index funds.Whether it all works out for the little guy remains to be seen, but one thing is sure: Regulatory costs will be on the rise, something larger shops - think Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) - are going to be able to absorb better than smaller players who are more reliant on commissions - think LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) and Raymond James (NYSE:RF).Big providers of index mutual funds and ETFs are winners as well - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW), and WisdomTree (NASDAQ:WETF) fit the bill. Active mutual fund houses like Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN), Legg Mason (NYSE:LM), and Waddell & Reed (NYSE:WDR), not so much.Insurers who are big providers are variable annuities could also be pressured - Ameriprise (NYSE:AMP), Lincoln National (NYSE:LNC), MetLife (NYSE:MET), Prudential (NYSE:PRU).Now read: Congratulations To All The New Fiduciary FAs Out There: Financial Advisors' Daily Digest (April 4) Apr. 5, 2016, 1:23 PM | 19 Comments

WSJ: BofA Andrea Smith leads stress-test submission
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) leads the league in fumbling stress-test submissions - three in last five years - but this year, the lender is tasking its own Winston Wolfe with tackling the job.“She’s pretty much fearless," says former Ken Lewis executive Steele Alphin of Chief Administrative Officer Andrea Smith. "I asked her to do things that were very, very difficult to do."Regulators have told the bank of their concern with excessive turnover in recent years of those running the test, and that the bank needs to stop viewing the CCAR as a once-a-year exercise, rather than part of a bigger-picture capital management effort. Part of Smith's job, writes Christina Rexrode, is to alleviate those concerns.Her job leading this task is of particular interest given her human resources background. Executives at other lenders running the test typically come out of finance or risk."It’s kind of like an orchestra leader,” says COO Thomas Montag. "I have no idea if the orchestra leader can play any of the instruments, but if you don’t have somebody at the front providing the timing and the direction and the focus, it sounds kind of lousy.”Now read: Bank Of America And Citigroup: Which Is The Better Investment?

RBC: Low rates could force breakup of big banks
Return on average common equity (ROACE) is what determines the valuation of large, mature banks, says RBC's Gerard Cassidy, and those banks that cannot earn their cost of equity capital - estimated at 9-10% through the cycle - ought to consider alternative strategies, including breaking up.The key here is interest rates, and should they remain at these levels for a prolonged period, reaching targeted ROACE will be difficult for all banks, particularly for Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C).While a sum-of-the-parts analysis indicates value could be unlocked, the cost of doing so could be prohibitive, says Cassidy.Long-term investors planning on holding through the cycle are better off with Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), but active investors managing their portfolios more aggressively might consider BofA and Citi.

Jefferies posts Q1 loss
"Our overall Q1 results reflect an exceptionally volatile and turbulent market environment during our first fiscal quarter," says Jefferies (NYSE:LUK) CEO Richard Handler. "A quiet December was followed by an extremely challenging January and first few weeks of February."The investment bank posted a loss of $166.8M in Q1 vs. a profit of $12.9M a year ago. Revenue of $299M fell a full 49%, led by an 82% plunge in trading revenue to $58.8M. Of this, fixed-income revenue fell to $56.8M from $126M. Equity trading revenue fell to just $1.7M from $203.5M thanks to markdowns on two equity block trades.Good times ahead: Not only have markets stabilized, says management, they've "aggressively snapped back" in the early part of Q2.Coming one month ahead of the rest of the Wall Street banks, Jefferies results are often seen as a bellwether of what to expect. It sounds like Goldman (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), CItigroup (NYSE:C), and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) have the month of March to make up for what was a very lame start to the quarter.ETFs: IAI, KCE, KBWC Mar. 15, 2016, 8:45 AM | 31 Comments

BAML names new head of global capital markets
Alice Murphy returned to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) from Goldman Sachs just over a year ago, more or less returning to her same job as co-head of leveraged finance, but reportedly with a promise of a clear path to a more senior role.She gets that with a promotion to head of global capital markets, taking over from Jim Probert who took on the role just two years ago.

Bloomberg: Wall Street wants a piece of BlackRock
While the big Wall Street banks are struggling with slides in fixed-income revenues, business is booming at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and other ETF providers offering credit-related products.The banks, writes Lisa Abramowicz, want some of that business back.The issue for banks are new regulatory and capital rules which make it harder to hold big inventories are paper investors want to trade. Meanwhile, the ease of moving in and out of vehicles like BlackRock's $25B IG bond fund (NYSEARCA:LQD) or its $16B junk-bond fund (NYSEARCA:HYG) have led to surging volumes, even as the individual securities underlying those ETFs are more difficult to trade.Banks are responding with the total-return swap in which an investor pays a fee to a counterparty who promises delivery of the total gain on a basket of certain debt. These instruments are not only quickly traded without having to deal with the underlying securities, but are pegged to some of the same indexes as the biggest credit ETFs. Citigroup (NYSE:C) just became the eight dealer in these derivatives (joining GS, BAC, JPM, MS, CS, DB and OTCQX:BNPQY), which are being pitched by banks as an alternative to ETFs.

Bloomberg: BofA cuts Asia investment banking staff
Among those exiting are Wang Bing, a managing director in the China investment banking operation, and Patrick Steinemann, co-head of Asia industrials banking. At least 15 senior bankers were cut, according to Bloomberg, along with junior positions and back-office jobs.The moves aren't a huge surprise as investment banks everywhere have been cutting jobs over the past few months, and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) in particular is focused on cost reductions.Citigroup earlier this week said Q1 investment banking revenue is set to fall 25% from one year ago.

Goldman and BofA cutting fixed-income traders
The two banks periodically cull their low performers, but - after an especially rough start to 2016 - cuts this year promise to be a little deeper. According to Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) will eliminate more than 5% of traders and salespeople (5% is the usual norm), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) will dismiss about 150."We remain committed to our FICC business, but we’re also managing to the cycle,” said Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein last month. Last week, JPMorgan's Daniel Pinto said FICC trading revenue is lower by about 20% this year. Mar. 4, 2016, 7:57 AM | 3 Comments
Gross: Epic era of credit expansion ending
The global economy has been powered by credit for more than 40 years, says Bill Gross - noting official credit outstanding today of $58T is 58x that of 1970. That expansion, though, looks to be ending, as private sector savers are growing leery, and regulators build fences against fast creation. And don't forget the meager returns, with negative interest rates in 40% of Euroland, and out ten years on the curve in Japan.The collapse in bank stocks globally isn't necessarily about energy losses. Price charts since 2007 for players like Citigroup (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS), Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) suggest the sector's either a screaming cheap buy, or "a permanently damaged victim of writes-offs, tighter regulation, and significantly lower futures margins. I'll vote for the latter."Then there's insurers, whose business models - which depend on 7-8% returns from risk assets - are at risk. They're not going bankrupt, but future profitability for companies like MetLife (NYSE:MET), Prudential (NYSE:PRU), and Hartford (NYSE:HIG) will be stifled as claims can't be covered as easily when investment returns are so lame.The same goes or pension funds, and Puerto Rico is going down Detroit's path not just because of overpromised benefits, but because they're not earning enough on their investment portfolios to cover those promises.Central bankers, meanwhile, think they can solve things by cutting rates just a bit further.ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, BTO, IYG, SEF, FNCL, FXO, RYF, FINU, RWW, FINZ, XLFS Mar. 3, 2016, 8:37 AM | 35 Comments
Timing in question as BofA makes big push into auto lending
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) last May tapped two mortgage executives to lead the auto loan business, writes Dan Freed, and they have hired loan officers and salespeople at a fast clip since.The timing could be deemed as curious, with regulators and competitors sending signals that the benign credit cycle of the past years has peaked.Across the industry, banks classified $1.1B of auto loans as uncollectible in Q4. That's up 15% from a year earlier, and 39% from 2011 (though the size of the market has grown considerably since 2011)."I'm not actively hiring or growing our operations across the platform. That's for sure," says Andrew Stuart, who heads TD Auto Finance.Earlier this month, Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank said auto loans after the financial crisis provided "once in a lifetime type returns," but now the business has begun to lose strength.For its part, BofA says its focused strictly on prime and "superprime" customers, and the vast majority of borrowers have credit scores above 700.

Buffett speaks
Buying IBM could be a mistake, says Warren Buffett (BRK.A, BRK.B), but he hasn't sold a share and continues to expect it to be worth more in the future (though "Charlie's neutral").On another troubled holding, American Express (NYSE:AXP), Buffett says it's a business that has always had to adapt, and now is no different. "It's a very strong brand, but you are going to face a lot of competition on payments."On yet another roughed-up name, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), The Oracle says CEO Brian Moynihan has done a great job after inheriting a bad hand.Buffett is unlikely to be an owner of Dow Chemical's (NYSE:DOW) common stock, and likes the preferred more. He owns $3B of preferred from 2009 that pay an 8.5% annual dividend. Converting would amount to about 6% of the common float.Of troubled names in general, Buffett reminds Berkshire Hathaway's stock price has dipped 50% three different times since he began controlling it. "It was terrific!" A stock going down is a good thing, unless the company itself is losing value.Live blog of CNBC interview Feb. 29, 2016, 8:18 AM | 93 Comments
High yield woes: Goldman struggling to sell Solera buyout bonds
In another sign of the difficulties lower-rated credits are having with borrowing, Goldman Sachs (GS +2.1%) is having a hard time moving $2B in paper backing the buyout of Solera Holdings, reports the WSJ.Solera late last year agreed to an LBO to Vista Equity Partners for $6.5B, including debt.The bonds backing the sale carry an especially weak Caa1 rating from Moody's, and it's in these lower-rated tranches where the worst of the high-yield carnage has taken place. Demand "is really nonexistent now," says one portfolio manager.Goldman had hoped to unload the Solera bonds at a price to yield about 10%, but by midday yesterday had only found buyers for about half of the paper, and pricing had moved above 11%.As painful as it is for borrowers, it's also so for the banks which earn big fees from lending commitments - great when the bonds are easy to move, but a profit eater when the stuff has so sit on the books for very long. Goldman, in particular, has sought to boost market share in this part of the business against traditional powerhouses like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).ETFs: HYG, JNK, HIX, HYLD, DHY, PHT, EAD, HYT, JQC, CIK, DSU, HHY, SJB, PHF, NHS, FHY, ACP, MCI, KIO, VLT, ARDC, ANGL, CIF, AIF, MHY, PCF, MPV, DHG, HYLS, IVH, JSD, UJB, GGM, CJNK, QLTC Feb. 26, 2016, 11:13 AM | 3 Comments
Heard on the Street: Banks caught in ugly cycle
It's another nasty session for banks today, writes David Reilly, and the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index is now lower by almost 20% YTD, with names like Citigroup (C -2.3%) and Bank of America (BAC -2.3%) down nearly 30%.The nasty feedback cycle begins with the crash in the oil price, which stings banks thanks to worries of big losses on energy-lending, and more broadly hurts lenders by dragging down the stocks in general. This in turn, leads to concern about a recession would further ding bank profits.More ominous, the yield curve is flattening. Using the spread between two-year and 10-year Treasury notes isn't a bad proxy for bank profits and it's slumped to just 0.96% today. Old-timers will remember when this spread used to turn negative - a sure sign of looming recession.The good news, says Reilly, is that the energy crash and low rates don't look to cause the sorts of losses seen in 2008. Take the long view - the cycle will someday turn.ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, KRE, UYG, VFH, KBE, IYF, BTO, IAT, IYG, SEF, FNCL, FXO, KBWB, QABA, RYF, FINU, KBWR, KRU, RWW, FINZ, KRS, XLFS Feb. 24, 2016, 1:13 PM | 35 Comments
Banks lower as JPMorgan warns on energy
Holding its investor day today, JPMorgan said it was going to add another $500M to energy-related loan-loss reserves. This followed a $67M provision in Q4, which at the time brought total oil and gas loss reserves to $815M (vs. a portfolio with book value of $44B).In addition, the bank said it could need to add another $1.5B to reserves should oil hang around $25 per barrel over the next 18 months. For perspective, prior to Q4, JPMorgan hadn't had to add to reserves for six years - in fact reserve releases were a big boost to profits across the industry."When the biggest bank increases reserves for potential oil losses it sets a tone for the industry,” says Mike Mayo.Separately, the FDIC says bad loan provisions across the banking sector were $3.8B higher in Q4 than a year earlier.JPMorgan (JPM -3.5%), Citigroup (C -2.9%), Bank of America (BAC -2.9%), Wells Fargo (WFC -2%), U.S. Bancorp (USB -3%), Regions Financial (RF -3.8%), Comerica (CMA -4.2%), Zions (ZION -4.1%), PNC Financial (PNC -2%).ETFs: KRE, KBE, IAT, KBWB, QABA, KBWR, KRU, KRS Feb. 23, 2016, 2:38 PM | 56 Comments
WSJ: Bank-stock rout tramples bonuses
Just at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), employees have taken $400M in paper losses on their restricted stock paid out as bonus last year, according to the WSJ.JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), BofA (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) haven't yet reported 2015 stock grants, but their share prices have been similarly hit.Should slumping stock prices persist, it could add to the leakage of talent from Wall Street to tech and other industries, as bankers will be leaving a lot less money on the table.The issue is a test for new Dodd-Frank rules which forced banks to tailor incentive packages towards rewarding long-term health, rather than short-term profits. The result: Banks are now more likely to award restricted shares which don't vest for several years. Feb. 18, 2016, 9:08 AM | 36 Comments
New Fed member suggests breaking up the big banks
Former Goldmanite and TARP czar, and now Minneapolis Fed President, Neil Kashkari says the time is right for Congress to go further than Dodd-Frank "with bold, transformational solutions to solve [too big to fail] once and for all."Lawmakers, he says, should break up the largest banks into "smaller, less connected, less important entities." Other options would be turning the large lenders into public utilities by forcing them to hold so much capital that they can't fail, or taxing leverage throughout the financial system.Watching with interest: BAC, C, JPM, WFC, MS, GS Feb. 16, 2016, 11:07 AM | 151 Comments

Deutsche Bank at record low as fear over European banks grows
It is the European banks and contagion concerns that are freaking out the markets today - not just the Fed, China and crude oil - according to David Rosenberg, noting that some of the European banks are trading at 2008 crisis levels after the group has tumbled 18% YTD vs. 11% for the STOXX 600 index.European financial firms are taking a beating amid fears of "a chronic profitability crisis that makes it impossible for banks to build up barely-adequate capital bases," WSJ reports.Deutsche Bank (DB -9.8%) is down another ~10%, bringing its YTD loss to nearly 40% while its valuation has fallen to ~30% of book value, and its credit default swaps spiked to their highest levels since 2012.News of major withdrawals out of Credit Suisse (CS -4.2%) caused its shares to sink 11% last week, hitting a 24-year low, and Santander (SAN -6.2%), BBVA (BBVA -5.4%), and UniCredit (OTCPK:UNCFF -5.5%) are down to lows seen during the last eurozone financial crisis."Oil and the flatter yield curve alone do not explain the 12% plunge we have seen in S&P Financials so far this year," Rosenberg says, adding that BofA (BAC -6.1%), Citigroup (C -6.2%) and Wells Fargo (WFC -3.5%) all briefly touched 52-week lows last week - "an ominous signpost."ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, PSP, IYF, EUFN, BTO, IPF, IAI, IYG, SEF, FNCL, FXO, PFI, IXG, PEX, RYF, FINU, KCE, RWW, KBWC Earlier: Markets extend two-day rout; gold gets 3% boost Feb. 8, 2016, 2:24 PM | 36 Comments
Heard on the Street: BofA too cheap
Bank of America (BAC -3.7%) has been especially punished in this year's selloff, losing 24% of its value vs. about a 13% drop in the XLF. Even though a rising rate scenario once again appears to be off the table, writes David Reilly, the stock trading at less than 60% of book value has priced in too dire of an outcome.On last week's earnings call, the bank said it could lose $700M over the next nine quarters if oil stays at $30 per barrel, and Bernstein's John McDonald estimates losses in a stressed scenario in excess of current reserves of $1.2B - equal to just 0.5% of tangible common equity, or roughly 5% of what the bank should earn this year.As for rates, even with a 10-year yield of just 1.75% one year ago, the bank had a NIM of 2.17% - it can still make money.With weak returns and a need for even more aggressive cost-cutting, BofA probably deserves to sell at a discount to book value, acknowledges Reilly, but 40% is just too much.A catalyst? Should the valuation remain this low much longer, activists are likely to boost the pressure on CEO Brian Moynihan, including calling for a potentially value-creating breakup.

Time to bet on big U.S. banks - Barron’s
Barron’s says it’s a good time to bet on the big banks after a rocky start to the year.The 10 biggest U.S. banks are trading for 8x-12x 2016 estimated earnings; the S&P 500 trades at 16x.Exposure to distressed U.S. energy companies is manageable.While leading Democratic presidential candidates are pushing for a breakup of the biggest banks, that possible eventuality could be a positive since many trade below their sum-of-parts.The following banks all have 20% upside: Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), BB&T (NYSE:BBT), PNC (NYSE:PNC), Suntrust (NYSE:STI), U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB).

More on Mayo's BofA upgrade
The stock trades at a 20% discount to year-end estimated tangible book value of $17 per share, says CLSA's Mike Mayo. That's worse than the recessions in the early 1990s and early 2000s, despite better balance sheet strength today.Further, the bank could grow book value even if the U.S. goes into recession.There's also the chance BofA (BAC +1.1%) could become an "event-driven" stock, says Mayo. First, the 67% efficiency ratio is worst among the large U.S. banks, so there's plenty of room for improvement. Second, a sum-of-the parts analysis yields a result 40% higher than the current market cap. Third, shareholders are starting to speak up - while an activist is an outside shot, increased owner pressure seems likely.He upgrades from Sell to Outperform, with price target of $16 up from (suggesting upside of less than 20%).Previously: Mike Mayo calls bottom in BofA (Jan. 29) Jan. 29, 2016, 11:14 AM | 38 Comments

Nasty post-earnings price action in BofA
The stock has given up another 2.6% today, even as the broader market rallies and its TBTF peers are just modestly lower.

Total headcount at the bank is 213.3K. The efficiency ratio at BofA for 2015 of 68.6% is far worse than competitors like Citigroup (57%) and Wells Fargo (57.8%)Cost cuts are nice, but revenue growth can also help that ratio.

Expenses at Bank of America remain "way too high," says Oppenheimer's Chris Kotowski.

ROTCE of 7.3% rose from 7.1%.Addressing the oil crash, new CFO Paul Donofrio says it's more supply than demand, He knows this, he says, because if demand for energy was dropping, it would show up in the asset quality of the bank's non-energy-related loans, and this isn't happening. Donofrio says energy makes up just 2% of the bank's loan portfolio.As for consumer benefits, CEO Brian Moynihan says spending on credit and debit cards rose 4% Y/Y, but without the oil decline, it would have risen 5.7%. Putting a dollar number on it, that's $20M per day in savings to the bank's credit and debit card customers.Earnings call presentation slidesPreviously: Bank of America beats by $0.02, misses on revenue (Jan. 19)Previously: Bank of America higher after bottom line beat (Jan. 19) Jan. 19, 2016, 11:06 AM | 13 Comments

Wells Fargo's quick post-FOMC boost in its prime rate while leaving the deposit rate unchanged makes clear why bank bulls have been banking on a higher Fed Funds rate - higher net interest margins.U.S. Bancorp (USB +1.3%) has quickly followed suit.Owing to the glut of deposits, it could be several quarters before lenders begin raising rates for savers, reminds CNBC's Kayla Tausche.The XLF is higher by 1.5%.Individual names: Bank of America (BAC +1.6%), JPMorgan (JPM +2%), PNC Financial (PNC +2.1%), First Niagara (FNFG +2.1%), Regions Financial (RF +1.2%), Schwab (SCHW +1.5%), MetLife (MET +2.1%), Prudential (PRU +1%).ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, KRE, VFH, KBE, IYF, BTO, IAT, SEF, IYG, FXO, FNCL, KBWB, FINU, QABA, KRU, KBWR, RWW, RYF, FINZ, KRS, XLFS Previously: Fed officially puts an end to ZIRP (Dec. 16)Previously: Yellen: Factors holding down inflation to fade (Dec. 16) Dec. 16, 2015, 3:04 PM | 48 Comments
Deutsche: BofA "purest play" for rising rates
Ahead of the Fed's expected rate hike later today, analyst Matt O'Connor reiterates his bullishness on Bank of America (BAC +0.5%)."While we are not convinced a material pick up in the economy is likely anytime soon, we believe [BofA] offers good upside optionality to this without having to pay for it," says O'Connor, noting the stock's low relative valuation.He's also impressed with the bank's focus on being the low-cost provider within the mass market for consumers, and for credit cards. The bank's earnings should be less volatile than that of peers as it's cut risk in its loan portfolio and exposure to sales and trading. Dec. 16, 2015, 10:08 AM | 6 Comments
Baird: Three bank names to buy on the dip ahead of the Fed
The troubles in credit mean investors need to discount those costs against the benefits of higher rates, say David George and team at Baird. In other words, downside risk to 2016/2017 EPS estimates arises not just from net interest margin compression, but also higher loan costs.Three picks from the team: Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) at 1.1x tangible book value vs. peers at 1.35x. The $18 price target assumes just 1.05x book given weaker returns on capital and revenue growth visibility. BB&T (NYSE:BBT) trades at 11.5x 2016 estimated EPS - inline with peers, but BB&T's solid pre-provision returns, competitive positioning, and better relative capital deployment opportunities warrant a premium valuation. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) is also trading about inline with peers through it too has better relative returns and growth opportunities. Dec. 14, 2015, 3:32 PM | 5 Comments
Goldman: Financials to buy on rate hike
Raymond James (NYSE:RJF), Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), Northern Trust (NASDAQ:NTRS), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) are best-positioned in the event of a one-and-done move from the Fed, says Goldman, as they get most the earnings upside from the initial move higher in rates, rather than needing "normalization.""Deposit betas" may be a source of underappreciated surprise, says Goldman, which doesn't believe banks will pass along much of the initial 50 basis point hike in rates to customers. Poised to benefit here: JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), BofA, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC), and E*Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC).Finally, clarity on the interest rate picture should allow bank managements to get moving in growing returns, Favored "self-help" stories: AIG, Ally Financial (NYSE:ALLY), Oaktree Capital (NYSE:OAK), Voya Financial (NYSE:VOYA), and Zions Bancorp (NASDAQ:ZION).

BofA expects inline decline in fixed-income trading in Q4
While trading results are expected to decline sequentially in Q4, it's inline with the typical seasonality seen at this time of year, says Bank of America (BAC +0.1%) CEO Brian Moynihan, speaking at an investor conference.“There’s nothing new here - the fourth quarter is always quieter ... Do we wish there were more activity? Yeah."Maybe more important is the year-over-year results, and Moynihan expects that to be up in the mid-single digits (though coming against a particularly weak Q4 in 2014).Webcast Dec. 9, 2015, 11:16 AM | 15 Comments

Fed review finds shortcomings in its handling of stress tests
Key to the issues are the computer models the central bank uses to simulate how banks might perform during a recession. The results spewed out by these programs effectively determine the level of dividends and buybacks of the nation's large banks (not to mention the career path of bank managers).Source: WSJ Internal reviews found shortcomings in the Fed's system for double-checking the models - too few staff, too heavy reliance on certain key personnel, and lacking clear procedures and policies about certain aspects of the validation process. “Similar findings identified at institutions supervised by the Federal Reserve have typically been characterized as matters requiring immediate attention," according to the report.In response, the Fed has done what most bureaucracies do - hired more staff and created a supervisory committee. Nevertheless, the findings of the reviews are likely to add fuel to calls from bankers and lawmakers for the central bank to open up the "black box" of its stress-testing models.Among the interested parties are Citigroup (NYSE:C), which failed a stress test, and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) - all of whom have had their issues.

Banks stay in commodities, but lower risk
So-called inventory-financing deals - otherwise known as traditional banking - are on the rise. We're replacing market risk with credit risk, says Goldman's (NYSE:GS) Gregory Agran, global-co-head of commodity trading.Whereas before Goldman and others might have had a relatively small group placing wagers on the direction of commodities, they now have a far larger group working on making loans. It makes for a sizable drop in profit margins - these new deals have returns as low as 2 % - but doesn't run afoul of new bank regulations.Joining Goldman in moving to expand inventory-financing are JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).

S&P downgrades raft of U.S. banks

For what is now the fifth consecutive year, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) ranks last among large U.S. banks in customer satisfaction, according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index.BofA had 68 points (down from 69 a year ago) versus Wells Fargo with 75, Citibank at 73, and Chase at 71. The overall average score for banks (with smaller players included) was 76.The outfit doesn't give a specific reason for BofA's weaker performance, but the bank has been aggressive in embracing the mobile revolution - shedding branches, eliminating drive-up services, and automating as much as possible of what's left.In other news, Soros Fund Management reports (as of 9/30) owning call options in BofA controlling nearly 1M shares.

"This is a shot across the bow from banks," says Pinnacle Advisory's Michael Kitces. At issue are popular aggregator sites - think Mint.com, Quicken (NASDAQ:INTU), Digit.co - which allow consumers to monitor all of their financial relationships in one place.JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) in recent months have also disrupted the data flow to these operators, according to the WSJ. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), reports the Journal, took action in July, with at least two aggregators being shut out.Naturally trying to protect their turf, banks are also concerned the aggregator sites could threaten account security (they often require bank-account passwords be turned over). Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB), Capital One (NYSE:COF), and JPMorgan are among those warning customers against sharing information with third parties. Nov. 10, 2015, 9:43 AM | 7 Comments
Regulators set out new rules for SIFIs
The Financial Stability Board has published new rules that aim to stop banks from becoming "too big to fail," confirming its final proposals for Total Loss Absorbing Capacity, or TLAC.Under the plan, large lenders will have by January 2019 to hold a financial cushion of at least 16% of their risk-weighted assets in equity and debt that can be written off. That requirement will gradually increase, reaching 18% of assets weighted by risk by January 2022.The FSB will put the rules, which will apply to the world's top 30 banks, to the G20 later this month.

BlackRock scales up with BofA money-market fund purchase
"This transaction is consistent with Bank of America’s (NYSE:BAC) ongoing efforts to simplify its business, in this instance, by outsourcing certain product manufacturing functions to an industry leader," says a bank spokesperson following  yesterday's deal to sell its $87B AUM money-market business to BlackRock (NYSE:BLK).While ZIRP has crimped the profitability of money-market funds, the deal could wind up being a sweet one for BlackRock should rates rise, and the boosted size (AUM will rise to $372B from $285B) should bring needed efficiencies if rates don't move. "It's a challenge managing cash in a low interest-rate environment, so we have to be highly efficient," says Tom Callahan, co-head of global cash management. BlackRock will leapfrog JPMorgan to become the #2 money market fund family after the deal closes next year (Fidelity is #1).Terms were not disclosed. Nov. 4, 2015, 3:40 PM | 1 Comment

BofA reaches $335M settlement of suit over financial-crisis mortgages, registry
Bank of America (BAC -1.8%) has come to a $335M settlement of a lengthy federal suit where it was accused of misleading shareholders about mortgage-backed security exposure, and about its dependence on MERS, the national mortgage electronic registry.In its 10-Q filing, the bank said the $335M was fully accrued as of June 30, though the deal still needs final court approval.The suit was led by the Pennsylvania Public School Employees Retirement System, which said shareholders were misled into buying BAC stock in 2009 and 2010. It was allowed to go forward by a federal judge in July 2012.Shareholders had claimed the bank knew it couldn't raise enough capital if it revealed it had to buy back billions of dollars in securities, and that it knew MERS was so shoddy that it wouldn't be able to legally foreclose on thousands of delinquent mortgages.

AIG may be activist target, but forget about the big banks
With Carl Icahn's targeting of AIG, activists are clearly climbing higher on the financial-services food chain, writes David Reilly. The goal is to make the companies small enough to not be subject to the sorts of stringent D.C. regulations associated with being too-big-to-fail.A case in point is CIT Group, which last week announced the departure of John Thain and a plan to sell certain units. Thain's goal had been just the opposite - to turn CIT into a TBTF.The biggest of the big won't be quaking in their boots, says Reilly, noting the typical tools of the activist - boosting capital returns or levering up - would be dead on arrival in Washington. As much as investors would like to see Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) broken up in order to realize value - they haven't traded above book value in seven years - it's not going to happen this way.Previously: Carl Icahn targets AIG (Oct. 28)Previously: CIT Group soars after strategic shakeup (Oct. 22) Oct. 28, 2015, 12:42 PM | 2 Comments

JPMorgan dives back into correspondent lending
A badly-burned Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) won't do it anymore, but JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) - aiming to make up for slowing business in its mortgage operation - is increasingly buying loans from smaller lenders, writes Dan Freed for Reuters.In H1, the Bank of Dimon bought 62% of the $58B in residential mortgages added to its books, up from 56% in 2014 and 37% in 2011. According to Inside Mortgage Finance, JPMorgan has shown the biggest increase among peers in so-called correspondent lending."As they gain more confidence about the environment, they go right back to the correspondent channel for more volume," says analyst Charles Peabody. "There's more risk in being that far away from the customer," says BofA's Steve Boland, who leads mortgage and auto lending. For its part, JPMorgan  says it only works with "experienced, well-managed, and high quality lenders," and reviews every loan in detail.Wells Fargo's (NYSE:WFC) Eric Stoddard - who runs the bank's correspondent business - says it's cheaper to buy mortgages from other lenders than to make the loans itself."I think Bank of America's (policy) is a little foolish," says lender Ken Perimutter, whose PERL expects to make about $1.6B in home loans this year, and sell about 60% of those to JPMorgan.

Morgan Stanley warns of earnings misses for big banks
The Street has priced in earnings declines for pretty much every sector, but Q3 and Q4 estimates for the financials have barely budged, and consensus sees Q3 results 10% above that of a year ago.Morgan Stanley's Huw van Steenis, however, sees FICC revenue declines of 10-25% - far more than the 5% or so that's been talked about by bank managements at recent investor conferences - as the commodity price crash combines with collapsing fixed-income trading, and the lack of volatility in forex action.With just $20B in FICC revenues, says van Steenis, Q3 is shaping up to be the second worst quarter for banks in the last two years. Leaving his own bank (NYSE:MS) out of the analysis, he sees FICC revenue declines of 17% at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), 9% at Goldman (NYSE:GS), and 6% at BofA (NYSE:BAC) and Citi (NYSE:C).Bottom line: "On EPS, we are 4% below consensus on average across our coverage for 2015, and 5% below for 2016. The biggest delta is for Barclays (NYSE:BCS), BNP Paribas (OTCQX:BNPQY), and Goldman in 2015, and SocGen (OTCPK:SCGLY), HSBC, and BNP in 2016."Source: ZeroHedge Oct. 5, 2015, 3:31 PM | 12 Comments

After winning vote, Moynihan moves
With some questioning if Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) cost-cutting strategy under CEO Brian Moynihan is losing steam, the bank yesterday began laying off roughly 200 employees in its trading and investment-banking units.In recent years, those units generated up to 40% of bank revenue with less than 10% of the company's staff, but BofA is the only major U.S. bank which posted a decline in trading and investment banking revenue in H1. It's also lost ground in areas targeted for growth like M&A."The rules have changed," says COO Thomas Montag, who is in charge of the units. The bank, he says, is no longer going to do business in some products and activities it previously engaged in.The news is not all bad. Montag's push to get the investment bank to work with the wealth management and the consumer bank (he showed up at one bank function with a hat and t-shirt emblazoned with the words "Cross Sell") appears to be paying some dividends. Referral volume of 4.2M in 2014 gained from 300K in 2010, with a success rate of 20%.Source: WSJ's Christina Rexrode and Peter Rudegeair Sep. 30, 2015, 8:23 AM | 6 Comments

BofA's Moynihan presents at Barclays conference
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan's prepared presentation is mostly familiar material to anyone who's followed the bank - where things stood when he took over, and the improvement since.Presentation slidesNotable is the $1.15T deposit base - its value will be more visible when rates rise, says Moynihan. The FOMC decision comes later today.Taking questions, Moynihan says he expects FICC revenue to fall 5-6% in Q3, about the same as what Ciit's John Gerspach hinted at in his presentation yesterday.The topic of the vote on whether Moynihan can keep both the CEO and chairman title did not come up.

Guggenheim boosts M&A outlook
Merger-and-acquisition volume in 2016-17 should be $3.3T-$4.5T, says Guggenheim, up from its previous forecast of $2.7T-$4.5T. The current drivers of M&A are likely to remain in place; macroeconomic conditions may remain uneven; and several specific factors may compel consolidation in certain industries. Health care, media, and telecom activity has been robust, and should stay so. Activity in energy should increase, but banking M&A should stay subdued.The winners? U.S. bulge bracket and boutique firms have gained market share at the expense of European and other non-U.S. companies. Showing the most market share gains is Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), followed by Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C). Goldman remains Guggenheim's Best Idea, and BofA and Ciit remain buys, partly thanks to the M&A thesis. Sep. 16, 2015, 12:39 PM | 1 Comment

Bloomberg: Odds are on Moynihan winning chairman vote
BlackRock, Vanguard and other institutions among Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) top-10 shareholders typically side with management in keeping the CEO and chairman's roles combined, according to their proxy guidelines."The very real risk of disruption from separating the roles is not worth the theoretical benefits that may come,” says public-company advisory attorney Avrohom Kess.CLSA's Mike Mayo concedes it's a tough battle for anyone like him who thinks the BofA proposal should be decline. "The big funds generally think a combined CEO-chairman is fine.

Bank of America makes its own vote push
A lot of investors and proxy firms are making headlines arguing for a vote against Bank of America (BAC +2%) CEO Brian Moynihan retaining the chairman's role, but the bank is mounting its own campaign in favor of the dual role.BofA head of strategy and marketing, general counsel Gary Lynch, and lead independent director Jack Bovender have been meeting with big investors both by phone and in New York to make their case. The bank is also paying $150K plus expenses to two outside firms to make phone calls to individual investors.The bank argues that taking the chairman role from Moynihan at this time - just as earnings are beginning to improve and the bank has seemingly overcome its stress test flubs - would be a distraction and throw BofA back into uncertainty. Those close to the matter say Moynihan hasn't given any indication of whether he would exit the CEO spot should he lose the chairman vote.Source: WSJ Previously: Proxy adviser ISS: Strip chairman role from BofA chief Moynihan (Sept. 4) Sep. 8, 2015, 10:40 AM | 16 Comments
Proxy adviser ISS: Strip chairman role from BofA chief Moynihan
Influential proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services has joined the choir urging shareholders at Bank of America (BAC -1.8%) to strip CEO Brian Moynihan of his chairman's title.With shareholders objecting since Moynihan got the additional title last year, the company promised a vote that was then moved sooner, to Sept. 22.On Tuesday, the country's two biggest pension funds urged separating the roles at BofA, due to "inherent conflicts." Mike Mayo noted that letting Moynihan serve in both roles could bring more regulatory scrutiny. Sep. 4, 2015, 7:00 PM | 24 Comments
BofA approved to use own calculations for capital
Under the "advanced approaches framework" approved today by the Fed and OCC, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) beginning in Q4 will be able to use its own risk weightings instead of standardized weightings when calculating risk-based capital requirements. This "framework" applies only to global banks with at least $250B in assets or at least $10B in foreign exposure.Before Bank of America (or any bank) can use this framework, it had to conduct a satisfactory "parallel run" using the framework.

Morgan Stanley: BofA a buy even without higher rates
"Do I need higher rates to buy Bank of America (BAC +1.6%)," ask Morgan Stanley's Betsy Graseck and Manan Gosalia. "No," they say, at least not at the current stock price.Forgetting higher rates, accelerating loan growth coupled with strong fee growth should lift revenues 3-5% Y/Y in 2016-17. Assuming a flat core expense ratio of 60% means another $0.07-$0.21 to EPS, or $2 to the stock price. And expense management - which BofA continues to work hard on - could mean even more upside to earnings. Sep. 3, 2015, 12:10 PM | 10 Comments
Wave against Moynihan as BofA chairman grows
The country's two largest pension funds - the California Public Employees' Retirement System and the California State Teachers' Retirement System - will vote against a measure allowing CEO Brian Moynihan to retain the chairman spot at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).The two roles have "inherent conflicts" requiring them to remain separate and independent, say the funds in a letter to the bank's lead independent director Jack Bovender. The funds also note continuing underperformance of the stock price since Moynihan took the CEO role in 2010, struggles with the annual stress tests, and "sub-par engagement" with investors. “Given these missteps, we do not believe now is the time to reduce oversight of management by combining the roles of CEO and chair.”Source: Bloomberg Continuing his campaign against allowing Moynihan to serve in the two roles, Mike Mayo brings a megaphone onto CNBC. A "yes" vote on Sept. 22 - allowing Moynihan to retain both spots - could put a regulatory target on the industry's back (surely he means another regulatory target).Previously: WSJ: Labor group urges vote against Moynihan as chairman (Aug. 28)Previously: Mayo unloads on BofA over chairman/CEO vote (Aug. 20) Sep. 1, 2015, 8:05 AM | 25 Comments

Margin calls could hit bank profits
A rare growth business for Wall Street banks has been loans backed by investment portfolios, but with margin calls being issued this week, profits could take a hit if clients pull back from borrowing.Morgan Stanley (MS +1.6%) had $25.3B in securities-based loans outstanding as of June 30, up 37% year-over-year. Bank of America (BAC +0.2%) had $38.6B of the loans, up 14.2%. Wells Fargo (WFC +1.1%) had $59.3B, up 16%.The amounts are small compared to overall bank lending, but change comes at the margin, and the largest brokerage firms have reported higher securities-based loan balances each quarter for more than two years.Look for profits at bank wealth-management units to decline in coming quarters, says Portales Partners' Charles Peabody, in part thanks to declines in securities lending.Source: WSJ Aug. 27, 2015, 10:06 AM | 8 Comments

JPMorgan is the "LeBron James of banking," CLSA analysts say in upgrade
"Like the basketball player LeBron James, [JPMorgan Chase] is good at both offense and defense,” CLSA analysts Mike Mayo and Chris Spahr write as they upgrade JPM shares to Buy from Outperform with a $78 price target.For defense, JPMorgan (JPM +4.3%) has "a balance sheet that is the most resilient since it has been in its current form, the most stable earnings of U.S. global banks for the past decade, and a dividend level vs. the 10-year that implies stock outperformance 85% of the time," CLSA says.For offense, JPM "is a unique self-help story given tailwinds from expense savings" and has "historically gained market share in tougher environments."Banking shares are broadly higher but the upgrade seems to be giving JPM an extra boost; three analyst upgrades appear to be helping Bank of America (BAC +5.2%) in similar fashion.

BofA upgraded at KBW, which sees cheap bank with limited China exposure
Bank of America (BAC -3.5%) is sharply lower despite getting upgraded to Outperform from Market Perform with a $20 price target at KBW, which believes the hit bank stocks have taken due to the “lower interest rates for longer” sentiment is not all negative, given that there would now be a decline in momentum investors who were buying bank stock merely based on rising rates.The firm says BAC shares have ~26% upside potential, the second highest upside of the 20 large regional/universal banks in its coverage universe, and it raises its annual EPS estimates through to 2017 to $1.48, $1.60 and $1.80 from $1.30, $1.50 and $1.73, respectively.BofA has limited exposure to the Chinese market, KBW notes, comprising less than 1% of the bank’s balance sheet as of Q2 2015.

He notes this "special" meeting is off-cycle from the spring annual meeting season when proxies are typically reviewed, thus reducing the degree of attention."Further, the move by the board that unilaterally reversed a prior shareholder vote could taint the industry and arm critics who argue that the industry cannot govern itself."Mayo's sentiments aren't surprising or even unusual, but for even better entertainment purposes, they come alongside his annotated version of Bank of America's (BAC -3.9%) proxy.Previously: Two big tests on tap for BofA's Moynihan (Aug. 19) Aug. 20, 2015, 3:50 PM | 64 Comments

A shareholder vote set for Sept. 22 will decide whether Brian Moynihan can keep both the CEO and chairman titles at Bank of America (BAC -0.8%), and one week later the bank's resubmission of its capital plan to the Fed is due."If they fail this time, I'd call for his head," says Cougar Capital's Buzzy Geduld, an owner of 2.5M shares of the stock. "At the very minimum, you split the CEO and chairman roles."Moynihan is deeply involved in the resubmission, reports Bloomberg, leading weekly steering meetings on the project. The bank is spending hundreds of millions overhauling data systems, rebuilding databases, and enhancing controls.One worry: Regulators haven't specified what they want from the bank, leaving the executive team in the dark about exactly what will get a thumbs up.Scoreboard: BofA is lower by 1.1% YTD versus the 5.5% gain for the 24-company KBW Bank Index. The stock is higher by 17% since Moynihan took over in 2010 versus an 84% gain for the KBW.In other news, the bank today named co-heads of its healthcare investment banking team in the Americas, with one of the new bosses being poached from Credit Suisse.

AmEx, CapOne (COF -13%), and Discover (DFS -2.7%) results show the boosted competition they face form the banks, which is slowing growth, and lifting marketing and rewards costs.Source: Barron's Previously: Capital One tumbles after earnings miss and trio of downgrades (July 24) Jul. 24, 2015, 3:31 PM | 10 Comments

Fed finalizes capital surcharge amounts for SIFIs
JPMorgan (JPM +0.4%) faces the largest capital "surcharge" or 4.5% of its risk-weighted assets, with the other seven lenders falling in the 1-3.5% range.Citigroup's (NYSE:C) surcharge is 3.5%, BofA (NYSE:BAC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) 3%, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) 2%, State Street (NYSE:STT) 1.5%, and Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) 1%. Taken together, the group's capital cushion will more than $200B larger than if the surcharge was not implemented.The surcharges will begin to be implemented on January 1, and fully phased in by January 2019. JPMorgan has taken steps to boost its capital levels, and Fed officials indicate the bank is about $12.5B shy of the full surcharge, reports the WSJ.The other lenders currently have the necessary capital.This new requirement comes on top of the existing base 7% common-equity capital standard necessary for most banks.

Bove makes bull case for banks
With Q2 results for the nation's largest banks now all in, Dick Bove says the key takeaway is operating earnings - which eliminates taxes, and the impact from loan losses and reserve releases - are not just growing, they're jumping. By his calculation, the operating earnings for BAC, C, JPM, and WFC are up 23% for the last twelve months compared to the previous period.Asset quality is far better nowadays as well, he says, noting the new regulatory regime has forced lenders to hold a higher amount of government-guaranteed paper on their books. "The addition of capital, cash, and government-backed securities means that the book value of these companies is very real. Yet, at least two of the big banks sell at a discount to this value."More bullish points: The most onerous and costly of the new regulations are already out there, litigation - while continuing - won't be nearly as expensive going forward, M&A is on the rise, and trading activity is coming back.Most importantly, says Bove, is that investment psychology is shifting. "The attitude that banks are utilities that can never show earnings gains is disappearing. The view that bank asset values are overstated is gone or should be gone. The view that the government has multiple new ways to attack these companies is also disappearing."ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, BTO, IAI, SEF, IYG, FXO, FNCL, FINU, RWW, RYF, FINZ Jul. 20, 2015, 12:45 PM | 18 Comments

Bank of America's Q2 results on tap for tomorrow
Analysts are expecting Q2 EPS of $0.36 versus $0.19 one year ago - the big jump coming thanks to last year's Q being hit with litigation costs. Revenue, however, is expected to drop slightly (JPMorgan and Wells Fargo both missed on the top line earlier today).Total loans and leases have been shrinking for years, at least in part as the bank gets out of certain businesses and runs off risky loans. With the financial crisis moving further into the past, can the bank get back to loan growth.Bank of America (BAC +0.5%) has made cost-cutting a priority, but its efficiency ratio is still higher (worse) than peers.Trading revenue.

Morgan Stanley: Three financials to buy into earnings
The team at Morgan Stanley has "high conviction" headed into earnings season on Bank of America (BAC +1.6%), Carlyle Group (CG +1%), and MSCI (MSCI +0.7%).Bank of America has 20% upside to Morgan's $20 price target, they say, the highest potential upside of all the large cap banks.

OCC ends enforcement actions on several banks, puts new restrictions on others
While the OCC lifted consent orders against Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citibank (NYSE:C), and PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) after finding unsafe and unsound mortgage-servicing and foreclosure practices back in 2011, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is part of a group facing new restrictions.Among other items, report Deon Roberts and Rick Rothacker, Wells Fargo is banned from entering new contacts to perform mortgage servicing for other lenders. The bank may still make and service new mortgages.OCC Deputy Controller Morris Morgan expects corrections from the group to be made in months, not years. “We have reserved the ability to take additional action against the six, and we plan to do so based on how quickly and effectively they remediate the remaining actions."The other five: JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), HSBC Bank USA (NYSE:HSBC), Santander Bank (NYSE:SAN), U.S. Bank (NYSE:USB), and EverBank (NYSE:EVER) Jun. 17, 2015, 11:30 AM | 12 Comments

Banking's winners and losers since the financial crisis
More than six years after the bottom, only four of the globe's biggest banks sport stock prices trading at a premium to book value. Leading the way is UBS at about 1.4x book. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) also trade for north of book.Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) - whose ROE of 2% is about one-tenth of what it was pre-crisis - brings up the rear at just about 0.5% of book. Barclays (NYSE:BCS) sells for roughly 0.7x book, and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) only slightly more than that.Checking further on ROE, Goldman leads the way at about 12%. Citigroup (NYSE:C) is less than 5%, but stands out as being the only bank with a higher ROE today than before the crisis.Looking at total return since the crisis, Goldman again leads the way at about 170%, with Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan a close second/third.

Financials turn higher for the year
Yield-starved financial sector names were mercilessly punished to start 2015 as sharply falling interest rates in January again disappointed investors waiting for the return of some spread income.The rout in bond prices since, alongside what now seems the near-certainty of the beginning of Fed rate hikes in as soon as three months has helped turn things around, and the sector - as measured by the Financial Select SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLF) - is now in the green for the year, and trails the S&P 500 by just about 150 basis points.Among the notable movers today as the 10-year yield rises to another 2015 high: Bank of America (BAC +1.4%), Wells Fargo (WFC +1.2%), U.S. Bancorp (USB +1.4%), Regions Financial (RF +1.3%), Huntington Bancshares (HBAN +1.6%), KeyCorp (KEY +1.6%), PNC Financial (PNC +1.3%), M&T (MTB +1.1%), Bank of Hawaii (BOH +1.6%), First Horizon (FHN +1.2%), Lincoln National (LNC +1.1%), E*Trade (ETFC +0.9%)ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, KRE, VFH, KBE, IYF, BTO, IAT, SEF, IYG, FXO, FNCL, KBWB, FINU, QABA, KRU, KBWR, RWW, RYF, PSCF, FINZ, KRS Jun. 9, 2015, 2:45 PM | 16 Comments
BofA and Goldman are more than rising rate stories
Cost-cutting is still a catalyst for Bank of America (BAC +2.5%), says JPMorgan's Vivek Juneja, noting the lender could add another $0.06 to annual EPS and improve its efficiency ratio by 100 basis points by cutting LAS expenses another $250M (as it plans to do). The bank has also just begun its SIM program (Simplify and Improve) to find cost savings which will free up money for growth investments.Goldman Sachs (GS +0.5%), says the team at Wells Fargo, is set to benefit from continued strength in M&A, plus potential to see greater client activity as rates rise. The bank's greater expense flexibility suggests it will maintain a healthy ROE advantage to peers. The consensus for peer ROE next year is 8.8% - for Goldman to maintain its edge, says Wells, it would need to generate a ROE of 15.4% vs. the 14.7% it posted in Q1 this year.Previously: Financials on the move as rate hike draws nearer (June 5) Jun. 5, 2015, 2:36 PM | 17 Comments

Bankers hustling to fund a Charter-TWC merger
Any talks between Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) and Time Warner Cable (NYSE:TWC) about a merger may be up in the air, but bankers won't be the bottleneck, as they're ready to talk about $25B or even more to make it happen.Following previous reports that Charter could go for $25B-$30B in debt, the cableco is talking with the same four bankers that committed $24B to Charter's early-2014 bid: Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS), Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).As one banker noted, "it should be quick to move to next steps, as the banks know the company pretty well," and said the package should end up as two-thirds bonds.Aside from any regulatory issues, leverage seems to be foremost on the mind of dealmakers (and investors). Liberty Broadband's (NASDAQ:LBRDA) Greg Maffei has gone public with the notion that Liberty could raise capital through rights offerings or tap $700M in cash to help with funding while maintaining its 25% stake in Charter.Other banks could join in too, which could make such a deal one of the largest junk bonds ever.

Amid another stress test fumble and a disappointing Q1, BofA is lower by 7.7% YTD vs. a 2.2% gain for the KBW Bank Index. "We've been saying these guys can earn $1.70 or $1.80 [per share], but they continue to struggle to get just to $0.30," says FBR's Paul Miller.See also on SA today: Bank Of America: Diamonds Are Forever (May 15) May 15, 2015, 7:32 AM | 18 Comments

Banks fines: How much and where have they gone?
More than seven years after the global financial collapse, regulators and investors are still working through a mile-high pile of lawsuits and other civil actions, and it seems like the fines keep on coming.Since the crisis, banks and other institutions have paid more than $150B in fines, settlements and other penalties, according to a tally by FT. That compares with the roughly $700B in profits generated by U.S. banks between 2007 and 2014.So where have all the payments gone? The biggest have landed in the Justice Department, which has collected some $50B. Other heavy collectors include the FHFA, Fannie Mae, HUD and the SEC.Among the banks paying the biggest amounts, BofA (NYSE:BAC) tops the list - with nearly $58B, followed by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) ($31.3B), Citigroup (NYSE:C) ($12.8B) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) ($9.7B).

Low-rate "torture" for the regional lenders

And it got worse in Q1. Six of the nine big commercial banks reporting so far - including Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and PNC Financial - had Q1 margins lower than Q4.Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Regions - two banks seen as particularly sensitive to interest rates - are unsurprisingly the worst performers in the KBW bank index (NYSEARCA:KBE) this year, off 13.9% and 9.3% respectively.What to do? Regions, for one, is trying to emulate the Wall Street big boys by bulking up its wealth management and capital markets operations. And maybe there's some more fat to trim. “We’re going to turn up the heat on expenses…and we’ll see where we get to,” said PNC boss William Demchak on last week's conference call.Source; WSJ's Peter Rudegeair ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, KRE, VFH, KBE, IYF, IAT, SEF, IYG, FXO, FNCL, KBWB, FINU, QABA, KRU, KBWR, RWW, RYF, FINZ, KRS Apr. 21, 2015, 9:37 PM | 9 Comments

BofA: Room for more cuts in compensation
"Investors want to see more," says Morgan Stanley's Betsy Grasek, taking note of Bank of America's (BAC +1.5%) driving down of core expenses and legacy asset costs. The bank's compensation costs to revenue ratio, however, is the highest among both money center banks and the super-regionals (40% vs. median 34%). "We believe they have room to bring this down, especially in a low revenue environment."She maintains an Overweight rating and $20 price target.Oppenheimer also maintains its positive rating despite what it calls a "dreadful quarter" for BofA. The "one-time" charges of $1.5B for retirement-eligible incentive costs and market-related adjustements to NII may not be so "one-time," says the team, also noting that core expenses are not falling inline with revenue.Previously: Stronger mortgage numbers, but weaker trading results as BofA beats estimates (April 15)Previously: Citi: BofA a buy on valuation and rate hikes (April 15) Apr. 16, 2015, 11:49 AM | 16 Comments
Citi: BofA a buy on valuation and rate hikes
It's a low bar to cross for Bank of America (BAC -1.2%), say Citi analysts Keith Horowitz and Michael Cronin. Even though the Citi team's 2016 EPS estimate of $1.45 is well below the Street at $1.65, the stock trades at just a bit above tangible book value (reported at $14.79 as of March 31).Combine that with BofA's being seen as a preferred vehicle to play Fed rate hikes given the bank's asset sensitivity, and it makes the stock a tactical buy.Source: Barron's Previously: Stronger mortgage numbers, but weaker trading results as BofA beats estimates (April 15)Previously: Bank of America beats by $0.07, misses on revenue (April 15) Apr. 15, 2015, 12:14 PM | 37 Comments

Morgan Stanley: BofA's wealth management business can be bought for free
Doing a sum of the parts analysis, Morgan Stanley slaps a regional bank multiple on Bank of America's (BAC +0.7%) consumer/other businesses and Goldman's multiple on BofA's investment bank/trading business, and finds the value comes to $15.70 - roughly the same as the current price.This means the wealth management division - which Morgan values at $4.84 per share - comes for free. Morgan notes BofA has generated the strongest AUM growth among its large-cap bank peers over the past couple of years - 14% CAGR vs. peer median of 11%. The division has also generated revenue CAGR of 6% and pre-provision operating profit CAGR of 12%.What's holding BAC back? Regulation and uncertainty over capital returns, of course, along with interest rates - investors continue to wait for higher ones and BofA is considered the most rate-sensitive of the big banks.

Diego De Giorgi and Karim Assef have been promoted to co-heads of global investment banking at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). De Giorgi - who joined BofA in 2013 from Goldman - was previously co-head of corporate and Investment banking for EMEA. Assef - who has been with the bank for nearly 20 years - was previously global head of investment banking coverage.The appointments, says the bank, are all about being able to serve clients and expand globally.“We’ve got some growth still ahead of us in Latin America.

Brokerages get tough with advisers who break rules
Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) is shaking up the ranks of its 14,000 brokers with an apparent zero-tolerance approach to brokers who break key company rules.Case in point: A top Indiana adviser with $1.3B in AUM was terminated in March without advanced warning. Merrill said it "lost confidence" in the adviser, ranked No.1 in his state on the closely-followed Barron’s Top Adviser rankings since 2010, for  “conduct including failing to discuss service level and pricing alternatives with a customer, providing inaccurate information to firm management during account reviews regarding this issue, mismarking bond cross-trade order tickets as unsolicited and providing information to a client during an active account review that did not correspond to the firm’s records.”In the past, brokerages tended to giving second chances to top producers. The new, tougher approach is seen largely as a response to closer regulatory scrutiny of brokerages.Securities lawyers agree this attitude is taking hold in the industry. Even small violations, such as poor record keeping or email retention, are drawing stricter penalties.Source: WSJ Apr. 5, 2015, 8:29 AM | 54 Comments

FICO readies new credit scoring system
Looking for some kind of growth wherever they can find it, banks are about to get their wish as Fair Isaac is set to launch a new credit scoring metric which should expand by tens of millions the field of those eligible to get credit.The new score will pull payment histories for things like utilities to calculate credit scores for consumers who might otherwise not have one. Other things - like how often someone changes address - will be used to help calculate a score.FICO and 10 unnamed credit card issuers have been testing the new score since November, and Fair Isaac intends to roll things out nationwide by year-end. Right now, about 15M of the 53M previously unscorable Americans can be scored using the new system.Source: WSJ Among those of interest: WFC, C, BAC, JPM, COF, DFS, AXP ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, KRE, VFH, KBE, IYF, IAT, SEF, IYG, FXO, FNCL, KBWB, QABA, FINU, KRU, RWW, KBWR, RYF, FINZ, KRS Apr. 1, 2015, 4:33 PM | 16 Comments

Mayo: BofA too big to succeed
"There is evidence of diseconomies of scale," writes longtime Bank of America (BAC -0.6%) bear Mike Mayo, arguing the lender would be worth 25% more if broken up."We do not see the downside for investors in supporting greater transparency," says Mayo, applauding the SEC's forcing the bank to allow a vote on a proposal calling for the spinoff of its investment banking operation.Mayo notes recent accountability issues like BofA being the only U.S. lender called out by the Fed in its stress tests this year, and last year's $4B accounting boner, after which the bank was forced to suspend its capital return plans.

Pleasant surprise may be in store in bank earnings in April
The big banks have had a rough start to the year, but surging trading volume in bonds, currencies, and commodities in Q1 could make for pleasant surprises when the lenders report quarterly results next month, writes John Carney.The average daily trading volume across all U.S. bonds was up 10.6% Y/Y through the end of February, according to Sifma, with trading in corporate bonds up 18.1%, driven by a big rise in issuance. Trading in Fannie, Freddie, and Ginnie MBS was up 35.3% from a year ago.Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) could be a particular beneficiary, as about 25% of its revenue is generated by FICC, and Credit Suisse sees the bank posting its first year-over-year increase in that unit's revenue since 2009.Others of interest: Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, IAI, SEF, IYG, FXO, FNCL, FINU, KCE, RWW, RYF, KBWC, FINZ Mar. 26, 2015, 4:37 PM | 5 Comments

Citigroup's (C +2.7%) $7.8B in buybacks was 10% higher than estimated by MKM analyst David Trone. Combined with the nickel dividend, that's total shareholder returns of $8.4B vs. his $7B expectation.Bank of America (BAC -1%) - though given just conditional approval - is set for $4B in buybacks and a nickel dividend. That's a total return of $6.1B vs. Trone's $3.1B estimate. Trone notes the bank can proceed with its buyback prior to resubmitting plans.JPMorgan's (JPM +1%) $6.4B buyback was shy of Trone's $7B estimate, but the 10% dividend increase was better than forecast. The total capital return of $12.9B vs. his $13.2B forecast is a "marginal negative."The dividend hike to $0.65 at Goldman (GS +2.1%) beat Trone's expectation of $0.62. As for the buyback, Goldman's policy of not disclosing the amount remains in place.Morgan Stanley's (MS +4.5%) capital return of $4.3B is more than double Trone's $1.9B estimate.Source: Benzinga Mar. 12, 2015, 12:47 PM | 4 Comments

BofA's Moynihan gets a pay cut
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan reportedly took a 7% pay cut in 2014 to $13M, down from a personal record $14M a year earlier.Moynihan received $11.5M in stock-based compensation, down from $12.5M for 2013, while his base salary remained unchanged at $1.5M.The payout for shows BofA’s board at least kept the CEO’s paycheck moving in the same direction as the company’s bottom line, which plunged 58% in 2014, weighed down by the costs of the DoJ settlement and other litigation; the bank’s profit did increase across most major units, including consumer and business banking and global markets.

WSJ: BofA's U.S. unit financed tax-avoidance trades
Not this stuff again, one imagines Bank of America (BAC -0.9%) shareholders saying.According to the WSJ, BofA's U.S. banking subsidiary for years has helped finance transactions from the bank's European investment bank arm which, among other things, helped hedge funds avoid taxes on stock dividends. According to the Journal, BofA has made about $1B in revenue from "dividend arbitrage" since the financial crisis.The practice - which drew the attention of regulators both for reputational risk as well as the need to wall off insured deposits from risky trades - has ended, says a bank spokesman.

Deutsche Citi upgrade: $4B in buybacks coming
Among the upside catalysts for Citigroup (C +0.4%) - says Deutshce in its upgrade of the stock to Buy from Hold - will be the approval of $4B in share repurchases in this spring's CCAR.Citi's plans to buy back stock and boost the dividend have been rejected by the Fed twice in the last three years, and CEO Michael Corbat has staked his job on approval this year.Another catalyst, says Deutsche, will be the sale or IPO of OneMain Financial.Turning back to the CCAR, Detusche expects the largest increases in capital returns to be at Citi, Bank of America (BAC +0.6%), Regions Financial (RF +0.3%), Morgan Stanley (MS +1.1%), SunTrust (STI +0.1%), and Citizens Financial (CFG +1.9%).

BofA denied in request for new Hustle trial
"The jury’s conclusion that this was a massive and intentional fraud was amply supported by the evidence," says federal judge Jed Rakoff, denying Bank of America's (BAC +2.4%) appeal for a new trial over a Countrywide mortgage-lending program known charmingly known as "Hustle."A jury two  years ago found the bank liable to the tune of $1.27B.No check will be written yet, as the denial clears the way for BofA to file another motion in appeals court, potentially setting up another long battle with the DOJ.The case is perhaps most interesting as most bank's typically settle these affairs well before they get in front of a jury, but BofA decided to let this one play out.Previously: BofA ordered to pay $1.3B in "hustle" case (July 30, 2014) Feb. 3, 2015, 1:54 PM | 16 Comments

MKM Partners: January tumble leaves bulge-bracket names cheap again
"We certainly recognize all the headwinds, notably on the regulatory capital side, but low-hanging fruit on capital efficiency actions should drive some ROE improvement," says the team of David Trone and Pankaj Chitrakar, and they expect better CCAR outcomes for at least a few of the names (including Citi, one would think) in a few weeks.As for operating results, whether they come in good or not so good this year hinges on whether the Fed hikes or not. That forecast sounds a lot like 2014, 2013, and 2012, but the two note the likelihood of higher rates appears far higher this year.They maintain Buy ratings on Citigroup (C +0.1%), Morgan Stanley (MS +1%), Goldman Sachs (GS +1%), Bank of America (BAC +0.7%), and JPMorgan (JPM +1.1%), with Citi, Goldman, and Morgan Stanley their top picks.Previously: Financials go on sale in January (Jan. 24) Jan. 29, 2015, 11:47 AM | 2 Comments
Financials go on sale in January
The financial sector is off to a worse start to the year than even the energy names, with the XLF down 3.9% YTD vs. the XLE's 3.2% decline. The S&P 500 is roughly flat. The SPDR KBW Bank ETF (NYSEARCA:KBE) is off 7.5%, and the Regional Bank ETF (NYSEARCA:KRE) is lower by 6.9%.Q4 earnings results haven't been wonderful, but financial names had been savaged well before those reports started coming out. Instead there's a difficult regulatory regime that won't quit, and - for now - it's looking like "wait'll next year" for the rising interest rates that were supposed to drive profit margins higher.

Bank of America expands into new markets
It's something Bank of America (BAC -1.6%) hasn't done in more than a decade, writes Deon Roberts - opening a branch in a new market.This week, the bank cut the ribbon on a branch in Denver, its first in that state, and BofA says there's more to come. In addition, the bank plans to open its first branch in Minnesota in Q2. It will come in Minneapolis and be followed by other branches in the Twin Cities area over the next two years.The moves are particularly noteworthy as BofA is rapidly closing branches in other U.S. markets, but CEO Brian Moynihan is making a point of having retail locations in major markets where the bank is already serving customers and businesses through its U.S. Trust and Merrill Lynch units. “We’ll go to other markets largely just to complete the footprint,” says Moynihan.

Consumer & business banking, wealth management, and global banking are all performing well and are why investors will be patient on BAC as a U.S. economy/higher interest rate play."Our gut is investors will be bummed about the revenue decline but stick with the stock as story hasn’t changed and valuation is a lot more palatable post the recent drop.”Previously: BofA earnings call: There's good volatility and bad volatility (Jan. 15)Previously: BofA off 2% after Q4 results (Jan. 15) Jan. 15, 2015, 9:51 AM | 33 Comments

Banks and higher rates ... Wait till next year?
2015 has opened much like 2014, with interest rates doing the exact opposite of what most expected, and falling sharply. It's a tough start for bank investors who have been counting on higher interest rates to help boost earnings for a number of years.In the meantime, deposits keep rolling in, and the pace of lending growth isn't quick enough to absorb all the money. In 2014, loan balances rose 4.4%, but securities holdings popped 12%, and cash assets jumped 22%.The good part of falling yields are unrealized gains on those security portfolios - negative a year ago, they're were in the green by about $15B on Dec. 31. More good news, says Goldman's Richard Ramsden: Valuations. The big banks are priced at about 9.9x estimated 2016 earnings, allowing for some nice upside if and when rates do decide to go higher.Reporting Q4 results tomorrow are JPMorgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC -0.8%), and on Thursday are Bank of America (BAC -1.4%) and Citigroup  (C -0.9%).

Bank of America pulls back from prime brokerage ambitions
BofA (BAC -0.1%) has cut ties with about 150 hedge funds in its prime brokerage group, reports Bloomberg, as new capital rules make the business less profitable (on an ROE basis).The bank had high hopes for its prime brokerage business after buying Merrill Lynch in 2009. "Hedge fund managers should expect banks to become more discerning in their allocation of equity to support new and existing business - redirecting resources away from businesses that are expected to earn low returns on equity,” said JPMorgan in a recent report.

Energy banking boom is over
The collapse in oil prices is set to crimp one of the few fast growth areas for banks since the financial crisis - lending to the energy industry. Right now, we're just talking about a slowdown in lending, but Charles Peabody - who saw the losses incurred by Texas banks during the 1980s energy slump - expects the current situation to lead to losses as well."It’s been a hot industry, probably a little too hot,” says Cullen/Frost (NYSE:CFR) CEO Dick Evans, whose bank has a sizable energy business. “But it is not time to panic. We have been in the game a long time. I am comfortable with what we have been doing.”The flip side of energy issues might be stronger business for banks elsewhere as consumers find themselves with more money in their pockets after filling up.Among the more sizable banks, Scotiabank (NYSE:BNS) leads the way with 34.6% of its investment banking revenue coming from energy companies. Next is RBC (NYSE:RY), with 20.2%, and then Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) with 14.9% and Citigroup (NYSE:C) with 11.8%. Others include Barclays (NYSE:BCS) with 10.7%, Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) with 8.1%, and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) with 7.4%. Jan. 12, 2015, 8:43 AM | 20 Comments

WSJ: BofA taps a pair to head FICC business
To review, current global head of FICC David Sobotka - comfortable with the progress the struggling business has made - reportedly set a retirement date for year's end.He's to be replaced - reports the WSJ - by Bernard Mensah and James DeMare. Demare has been with BAC since 2008 and is currently head of global securitized products and real estate portfolio management. He'll continue to be based out of NYC.Mensah joined BofA in 2010, and currently runs FICC trading for EMEA. He'll continue to be based in London.Amid a tough time for FICC action in the banking industry, Bank of America managed to post an 11% Y/Y gain in Q3, though CEO Brian Moynihan has said Q4 isn't looking anywhere near as robust.

Jefferies results bad omen for investment banks
Jefferies yesterday posted a 73% plunge in fixed-income trading revenue for the quarter ended Nov. 30, and a 45% fall in equity-trading revenue. “You’re going to see weaker trading results because of what I’d call bad volatility,” says Charles Peabody, as firms cut back on stock and bond offerings.That Q4 trading revenue is going to be a weak one for the likes of JPM, C, BAC, GS, and MS shouldn't be a major surprise as Ciit's Mike Corbat, BofA's Brian Moynihan, and JPM's Marianne Lake said as much when presenting at a financial services conference earlier this month. But the weakness they described is nowhere near what was reported at Jefferies.Alongside the weak trading results, Jefferies is also looking to get rid of Bache - its commodities-trading business. "The fact that they are throwing in the towel on this business just a few years in would suggest that maybe that opportunity is not nearly as robust as they thought it would be,” says UBS's Brennan Hawken.Previously: Jefferies posts loss, mulling sale of Bache unit (Dec. 16, 2014) Dec. 17, 2014, 7:36 AM | 3 Comments

Pabrai still bullish on BofA and Citi
"My feeling is that if a bank has proper reserves and it’s trading well below tangible book value, that is an undervalued bank," Mohnish Pabrai tells Barron's, quickly summing up the investment case for two of his holdings, Bank of America (BAC -1.1%) and Citigroup (C -1.1%). "You could shut down a bank today and if the reserves are correct you would get back the tangible book value."Both are trading a lot closer to book (or even above) then they were when he first invested, but Pabrai considers them still undervalued and expects they'll eventually trade more inline with the higher P/B and P/E multiples of Wells Fargo and JPMorgan.Of his $700M AUM fund which has outperformed the S&P by about 150 basis points annually over the last decade, the Buffett disciple Pabrai keeps fees down thanks to low overhead - he's the sole analyst and portfolio manager.

Banks: "Your money's no good here"
A combination of new regulations and near-zero interest rates has some banks - including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup (NYSE:C), HSBC, Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) - privately telling larger clients to take their deposits elsewhere or face fees on accounts which have long been free.“Ultimately my balances aren’t as profitable for the banks, and that’s going to impact my business,” says an executive with a title insurance company, complaining of sleepless nights amid negotiations with his bankers.BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) has begun charging institutional clients money to park money in euros, and State Street (NYSE:STT) says itwill soon begin doing so.Some bankers are advising large clients to break up large deposits across a number of lenders (including smaller banks not subject to the new regulations), and other corporations are going to find themselves needing to build more sophisticated (and riskier) portfolios likely including vehicles like short-term bond funds and uninsured money-market funds.

UBS turns bullish on financial sector
A positive macro outlook for the U.S. (especially compared to the rest of the globe) should boost credit demand, says UBS - upgrading U.S. financials (NYSEARCA:XLF) to Overweight - while the start of a new rate-hike cycle next year bodes well for interest margins.UBS's three favored U.S. banks are Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), but TD Bank (NYSE:TD) also makes the buy list thanks to its large American presence.ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, KRE, VFH, KBE, IYF, IAT, SEF, IYG, FXO, FNCL, KBWB, RKH, QABA, FINU, KRU, RWW, KBWR, RYF, FINZ, KRS Dec. 1, 2014, 11:40 AM | 6 Comments
Easier mortgage standards on the way
New guidelines - set to take full effect on December 1 - are the result of an agreement reached last month between banks and the GSEs meant to clarify exactly when lenders could be called to task for mortgages sold to Fannie Mae (OTCQB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac (OTCQB:FMCC) which ultimately default. Since the financial crisis, Fannie and Freddie have forced banks to repurchase billions of dollars worth of mortgages, leaving them naturally gun-shy about making new loans to all but the most pristine of credits.“It’s providing greater certainty for all the parties so that you can lend more confidently and make the whole judgment process much easier and more clear cut,” says Mike Heid, president of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) Home Mortgage. Along with SunTrust (NYSE:STI), Wells says borrowers should begin to see initial changes - such as faster processing times, reduced credit score requirements, and greater leeway to those whose credit history suffered due to one-time events - in a few weeks."We will be able to be looser and open up the net wider," says Mason-McDuffie Mortgage CEO Bill Godfrey, now expecting to make loans down to a 620 credit score from 660 previously.Not everyone agrees: “Unless we are convinced that the rules are going to be permanent and there is not going to be a look back or a reach back in future times…we are simply going to stay on the sidelines," U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) boss Richard Davis has said, and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan made similar comments at a recent conference.

Supreme Court takes on BofA second mortgages cases
The two cases both come from Florida and involve so-called "stripping off," where a homeowner in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing can void second mortgage debt when the first mortgage is greater than a home's value.An appeals court allowed the practice, but Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) says the approach taken by the court is different than that of other appeals courts around the country and thousands of pending cases could be affected.

Banks probed for violating bankruptcy laws
Real sweethearts if you believe the reports, the likes of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) are being investigated by the Feds for still going after borrowers after their debt has been legally discharged in a bankruptcy.Paying little attention to such court-ordered discharges, the banks reportedly are keeping the debt alive on credit reports, more or less attempting to force borrowers to pay on bills which they no longer owe.The issue, say sources, is the way banks report to credit agencies. Once a debt is voided through bankruptcy, creditors must update credit reports showing that debt is cleared. Banks, however, routinely fail to do so, instead leaving notations of "past due" or "charged off." A clerical mistake would be one thing, but, according to a number of bankruptcy judges,, banks refuse to make corrections unless the borrower pays.The banks contend they are complying with all federal laws in their collection and sale of debt. Class-action suits have also been filed and the banks are trying to have them thrown out, arguing its third-party debt buyers who are in control.

Moynihan: BofA not about to lower mortgage standards
The FHFA wants to ease lending standards - allowing down payments of as little as 3% - but Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) won't be playing along, says CEO Brian Moynihan, speaking at a BAML conference.Webcast replay"I don't think there's a big incentive for us to start to try to create more mortgage availability where the customers are susceptible to default," he says, and those who can't come up with at least a 10% down payment should probably consider remaining as renters. "You won't see us start to expand our criteria much past what we've done today."Given the shell-shock from the unceasing legal assault and put-back demands, can BofA or any other lender be blamed?

David Sobotka, Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) global head of fixed income, currencies, and commodities trading will exit by year's end, reports the WSJ, citing an internal memo. He was named co-head of FICC trading in 2011 and took on the role by himself a little more than a year ago.Slow FICC business has been a sore point for the major banks for more than a year now, but the declines were never as deep at BofA as they were for some competitors, and FICC revenue at the bank rose 11% to $2.25B in Q3. Among the reasons for Sobotka's exit, says a source, is his comfort with that speedier-than-expected rebound.

BofA's mortgage settlement hung up on SEC infighting
The $16.7B settlement supposedly agreed to in August is being held up by two Democratic SEC commissioners over waiving additional sanctions set to kick in when the deal is entered in court. The two Republican commissioners are fine with the waivers, and the swing vote - SEC Chair Mary Jo White - isn't participating due to a conflict.At issue is political pressure that lawmakers have been too soft on Wall Street. Banks typically seek - and are granted - three key waivers when settling cases, with the most important one being a ban on managing mutual funds. For Bank of America (BAC -1.1%), the key waiver would allow it to continue seeking investors for private firms like tech companies which haven't yet gone public.The waivers are often one of the reasons financial firms decide to settle cases rather than go to trial. “The commission and its staff should not be in the business of rubber-stamping and approving all waiver applications simply because a request is made,” says Commissioner Luis Aguilar, one of the two who are holding the settlement up.

Goldman: Every client asking about the same four things
Global growth, foreign-exchange, oil, and small caps are the subject of every client inquiry, says David Kostin. His team's recommendation: Buy "American exceptionalism."In Kostin's view, U.S. economy and corporate fundamentals are still strong, with economic growth expected by Goldman economists to be 3.2% next year, the fastest expansion since 2005. Europe is expected to grow just 1%.What his team likes are those stocks of companies which have a high proportion of domestic sales, plus sectors like Consumer Staples (XLP -0.1%) and Discretionary (XLY +0.7%) which stand to benefit from lower oil prices (plunging again today).As for small caps (IWM +0.9%), Kostin is wary, noting downward earnings revisions have boosted small cap P/E ratios even as prices have declined.The list of S&P 500 names capturing two or more of Kostin's themes: GT, GM, PCLN, AMZN, CMCSA, LOW, DG, TSN, ADM, CVS, AVP, WAG, PXD, HAL, JPM, BAC, SCHW, PNC, MS, C, GNW, LNC, MET, THC, AET, UNH, ESRX, HUM, WLP, BIIB, GILD, DAL, CMI, FLR, CRM, JBL, MA, FB, MU, FSLR, VMC, MON, T.

Straightforward banking - taking deposits and making loans - is far more the norm there then here, he says, and the forcing of banks to trim businesses and balance sheets is a large contributor to the Continent's stagnant growth.ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, KRE, VFH, KBE, IYF, IAT, IAI, SEF, IYG, FXO, FNCL, KBWB, RKH, QABA, FINU, KCE, KRU, KBWR, RWW, RYF, KBWC, KRS, FINZ Oct. 10, 2014, 12:52 PM | 4 Comments

Banks eyed for move to help hedge funds cut taxes
The usual banking suspects are falling under the gaze of regulators for a trading strategy known as "dividend arbitrage" which helps their hedge fund clients reduce taxes, and from which the banks earn more than $1B in fees annually.The strategy - typically run from London - involves banks temporarily transferring ownership of stock to a lower-tax jurisdiction about the time when the client expects to receive a dividend on those shares. It's perfectly legal say the banks and hedge funds.Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), however, has been questioned by the Richmond Fed (Charlotte comes under its purview) about the legal and reputational risks of such maneuvers, reports the WSJ.It isn't clear if other banks have been similarly questioned, but a number of other lenders do the same thing.

Holder’s departure could signal end of big mortgage cases
Today's resignation of Attorney General Eric Holder could mark the beginning of the end of the Justice Department’s push to hold big banks accountable for their conduct leading up to the financial crisis.Several big banks, including Goldman Sachs (GS -2.1%) and Wells Fargo (WFC -1.1%), are still under investigations by the Justice Department for their sale of flawed mortgage securities before 2008, but settlements in those cases are expected to be much smaller than the big sums extracted from Bank of America (BAC -1.8%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM -2%) and Citigroup (C -2.2%).Another sign that the big bank cases may be winding down: Tony West, who was Holder’s point man in the bank settlement talks, recently left the Justice Department to join PepsiCo as its general counsel.

Barron's makes the bull case for Bank of America
"Starting next year," writes Jack Hough in Barron's, "BofA (NYSE:BAC) investors will get a glimpse of two things they haven't seen in years: a fairly clean income statement and a decent dividend." Litigation costs are set to nail the bank again this quarter, but then will begin to quickly clear away, leaving investors to focus on the bank's operations. Earnings per share - an estimated $0.75 this year - could hit $2 in 2017, and the annual dividend ($0.20 now) could rise to $0.55.CEO Brian Moynihan notes core pretax profit in four of BofA's five units was $8.5B in Q2, up from $6.8B two years ago. Business #5 is mortgages, and that provided a $4.5B loss thanks to now rapidly fading legacy issues. Litigation costs make most of the headlines, but there's also non-litigation expenses like modifying some loans and foreclosing on others. These costs dropped to $1.4B last quarter from $2.3B a year earlier, and are expected to fall to $500M in 2015.Upgrading BofA to a Buy earlier this month, Goldman - looking past litigation and other one-time items - says the bank has had the largest reduction in earnings volatility of any of its peers in recent years and the stablest trading revenues since 2013. The beacon is Wells Fargo - earnings stability and a higher dividend has that stock trading at a premium 1.7x book value. BofA is at 0.8x, and as its steadier earnings begin to become clearer, that valuation discount should narrow.Bank of America is also underowned, says Goldman, noting its weighting in mutual funds relative to its weighting in the S&P 500 is the second lowest among 25 large financials (the lowest is Berkshire Hathaway).

Citi and BofA to offer mortgage deals for troubled borrowers
Isn't this one of the ways we got into the housing mess? Citigroup (NYSE:C) signs on with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) to fund 15-year mortgages at below-market rates for borrowers with low incomes, spotty credit histories, or both.The loans are being originated by the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America (NACA), a group - that has the ear of HUD - known for pushing banks to show they're fulfilling the terms required of them by the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (no redlining).The moves also follow the banks' massive mortgage settlements, part of which were agreements to provide assistance to troubled mortgagees, though both say this new program is not related.For its part, NACA says the foreclosure-loss rate on more than 18K purchase loans it has originated since 2006 is about 0%, with one of the reasons being NACA making up to three months of mortgage payments when borrowers run into trouble.

Fighting the last war? BofA promises restraint on mortgages
Speaking at the RBC Capital Markets conference, the new co-heads of Bank of America's (BAC +0.3%) consumer banking operation say the bank isn't going to get too aggressive in mortgages anymore.Webcast"We're not going to get into correspondent," says Dean Athanasia. "We're not going to do things to attract all sorts of non-customers.”Less new strategy than a recommitment of one made a few years back, the mortgage restraint led Bank of America to miss the refinancing boom of the past few years. Its market share in mortgages - above 20% in 2009 - has fallen to 5%, and competitors like JPMorgan and Wells Fargo still get plenty of mortgage volume buying business from third parties.

Notes from BofA's Barclays presentation
Cost savings of $2B from the New BAC initiative were originally expected by mid-2015, but with $1.8B already booked by Q2, Bank of America (BAC +0.5%) expects to hit $2B by the end of this year, says CFO Bruce Thompson. The other savings initiative - Legacy Assets and Servicing costs are expected to fall to $1.1B by 2015 Q1. They were $1.4B in Q2 of this year.Presentation slidesTurning to capital, the bank's fully phased-in Basel 3 common equity tier 1 ratio of 9.9% compares to the proposed minimum of 8.5% by 2019.As for net interest income, it's holding steady - $10.4B in Q2 vs. $10.5B two years ago - but, like everyone else in financial services, the bank awaits higher interest rates for growth in this segment.Credit quality trends continue to improve, and the bank is highly provisioned: Its allowance for loans and losses - $15.8B in Q2 vs. $21.2B two years ago - is 3.67x the annualized charge-off rate vs. 2.51x two years ago.Guidance for capital returns in 2015? The new CCAR rules aren't even out yet, says Thompson, but the bank is particularly focused on improving its metrics at those points where it was closest to failing in this year's test.

U.S. banks to be hit with tougher capital rule
The Fed intends to impose a capital surcharge on banks tougher than the international standard, according to Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo's prepared remarks for the Senate Banking Committee. Those banks with heavier reliance on short-term funding like overnight loans - i.e. Goldman Sachs (GS -1%) and Morgan Stanley (MS -1.8%) - will likely face even more rigorous requirements.Officials haven't yet decided on a number, but reportedly are considering as much as 200 basis points more than the top range of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets agreed to by international regulators.What's not yet clear is who would need to raise capital to meet the new, tougher standard.Citigroup (C -1%), Bank of America (BAC -0.6%), JPMorgan (JPM -1.3%), Wells Fargo (WFC -0.4%), State Street (STT -1.1%), Bank of New York Mellon (BK -0.9%)ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, IAI, SEF, IYG, FXO, FNCL, FINU, KCE, RWW, RYF, KBWC, FINZ Sep. 9, 2014, 12:24 PM | 25 Comments

Richard Pzena sees value in big financials and big oil
"Most of the reason that banks are underearning relative to their historical norms ... is economic and not regulatory," says Richard Pzena (NYSE:PZN), who remains bullish on the TBTFs. Low interest rates, weak trading, and "government persecution" are the three factors, and - should these normalize - earnings could nearly double at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C), though JPMorgan's (NYSE:JPM) boost would be more modest. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is another favorite.Broad financial ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, SEF, IYG, FXO, FNCL, FINU, RWW, RYF, FINZ Another cheap sector is energy, says Pzena, and based on relative valuation against the broader market - whether price-to-book or price-to-earnings - the major integrated oil companies are selling near all-time lows.What the market is missing, says Pzena, is the nature of oil investment. The old days saw capital spending one year, and boosted volume the next. Projects nowadays are far larger and require several years of spending before returns roll in. "We think those big new projects are going to perform and produce decent returns."

"We can start to see how [Brian Moynihan] can start running the company for shareholders and not litigants," says analyst Marty Mosby following Bank of America's (BAC +3.8%) $16.65B mortgage settlement with the government.The removal of the legal overhang is nice as is today's rally, says portfolio manager Dave Ellison (an owner of the stock), but higher interest rates are necessary for a sustained move upward in the shares."We believe they have a wonderful franchise - the question now is, 'Do they,'" says fund manager Greg Donaldson.

Goldman leads Wall Street to open-source Bloomberg alternative
Wall Street firms led by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are closing in on a deal to purchase a stake in chat and instant messaging start-up Perzo as an alternative to Bloomberg's similar application, Reuters reports.Bloomberg has dominated Wall Street for years, but banks have been looking for a substitute as sluggish trading volumes and higher regulations weigh on revenues.

BofA again requests nickel dividend
The bank last March originally received Fed permission to boost its quarterly payout from $0.01 to $0.05 (along with a $4B buyback), but was forced to withdraw that plan after discovering it miscalculated capital levels.Bank of America (BAC) subsequently fixed the accounting issue and resubmitted a capital plan in May, and the WSJ reports the lender is requesting the same size dividend, though the buyback plan has been toned down.For the bank - which has made boosting the dividend a top priority - the move projects to the Fed a sign of strength and that there are no more accounting cockroaches out there. For the Fed, its decision will establish a precedent for how these errors might be dealt with in the future.All this is happening as pressure mounts for BofA to come to a settlement with the DOJ over mortgages, and word is Eric Holder has no interest in talking turkey with Brian Moynihan until their lieutenants get a lot closer to a final deal.Shares -1.6% premarket as S&P 500 futures tumble Jul. 10, 2014, 7:26 AM | 19 Comments
Reuters: Holder will not meet with BofA over mortgage settlement
Eric Holder says he will not meet with BofA (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan to discuss a settlement over the bank's mortgage lawsuit with the Justice Department, Reuters reports. The Attorney General states that the "parties remain too far apart for a meeting to be productive."In prior negotiations over the shoddy mortgage selling lawsuit, BofA discussed paying $12B to resolve the claims, although the Justice Department countered with a $17B settlement .JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon previously cut a $13B deal with Holder regarding his bank's involvement with its mortgage selling before the financial crisis, and BofA was seeking a similar negotiation.

Rumored Citi settlement out of line
The bank issued $91B in private-label MBS between 2005 and 2008, say Morgan Stanley's Betsy Graseck and Manan Gosalia. That's just 20% of what JPMorgan sold and 14% of Bank of America's issuance.The reported $7B settlement would amount to 7.7% of Citigroup's (C -0.3%) pre-crisis issuance vs. JPMorgan's 2% settlement - this despite the fact that losses on Citi's MBS book were inline with its peer group. Nevertheless, the team notes these press rumors have been somewhat on the mark and cut their Q2 EPS estimate by $0.70 to $0.40 to account for the $4B hard-dollar amount (the other $3B is for borrower relief).Up next is Bank of America (BAC -0.2%), which will now see boosted pressure to reach a deal with the DOJ, and Morgan has baked in a $12B settlement, or 1.8% of the face amount of securities issued. Other press reports have suggested a number closer to $17B. Jul. 9, 2014, 11:51 AM | 72 Comments
Morgan Stanley team also a bull on BofA
Morgan Stanley joins yesterday's bullish call on Bank of America (BAC +1.1%) from Deutsche Bank, with analysts Betsy Graseck and Manan Gosalia noting BofA is least exposed to the slowdown in activity in commodities, rates, and FX, and thus has less downside.Combine that with valuation - BofA sells for 8.8x 2015 EPS vs. Goldman at 9.7x, JPMorgan at 9.1x, and Citi at 9x - and expense reductions which should be better than peers, and Bank of America could be the buy of the group.Previously: More on Deutsche's upgrade of Bank of America Jul. 3, 2014, 1:04 PM | 22 Comments
Can booming M&A offset trading slowdown?
Global M&A deals in H1 totaled $1.571T, according to Mergermarket, up 56% over the same period in 2013, and up 29.8% from last year's 2nd half. in the U.S., $694.6B of deals in H1 nearly doubled that of one year prior. European deals of $453.6B gained 35.5%, and Asian deals of $286.7B rose 56.8%.The M&A boom could help offset at least some of the widely expected continued trading slowdown this quarter (banks begin reporting their Q2s in about 10 days), and Goldman (GS +0.1%) tops the advisor tables with $533.8B in deals in H1, up 112% from a year ago.

Report: Banks to lose billions from new swaps rules
Banks could lose up to $4.5B in annual revenue as new regulations alter how swaps are traded, according to a report from McKinsey & Co. That amount is equal to 35% of the $13B in revenue booked by banks from trading in rate derivatives, and it comes at a time when FICC business is already on the decline.At issue are new rules requiring swaps trade on electronic systems rather than over the phone ("Thanks, big boy"), and the greater transparency should bite into profits. To counter this, says McKinsey's Roger Rudisuli, banks will have to cut costs and realign teams to focus attention on fewer customers.The usual suspects make up the 5 largest U.S. swaps dealers: JPM, C, BAC, GS, and MS.ETFs: IAI, KCE, KBWC Jun. 25, 2014, 10:04 AM | 15 Comments
BofA lowering cutoff to get into preferred rewards program
Looking to win more business from existing customers, Bank of America (BAC) today will announce it's lowering the threshold for clients to participate in the "preferred rewards" program to those with at least $20K in deposits vs. $50K previously.Among the benefits of the program are lower rates on mortgages and home equity loans, higher rates on savings accounts, and free stock trades.The move comes as the bank looks for ways to boost revenue and the targets of the program are those households with a little scratch, but not wealthy enough to be Merrill Lynch or U.S. Trust customers. Compared with other retail account holders, preferred banking customers "are anywhere from three to four times more profitable," says Dean Athanasia, the bank's head of preferred and small business banking.

In advisory business, it was Goldman Sachs and BAML - each bringing in about $1.5B - which led the way.

Mortgages: Go big
“Jumbos are growing while almost everything else is dead,” says FBR's Paul Miller. “Big banks need loan growth. If they were getting decent commercial loan growth, they wouldn’t be so aggressive on competing for jumbos.”As the rest of the home loan market contracts (sharply), applications for jumbo mortgages (above $729K) were up 4.9% Y/Y in March. Another reason for banks plowing into jumbos: They don't have to pay the higher guarantee fees charged by the GSEs, allowing them to actually charge lower rates than on conforming loans. At Wells Fargo (WFC), the current rate for a 30-year fixed jumbo mortgage of 4.13% is 12 basis points less than that for a conventional mortgage loan.JPMorgan (JPM) is boosting its efforts and created a special process to review all declined loans to make sure the decisions make sense. It also has a group working with wealthier clients who have more complex financial situations, such as being self-employed. The bank's jumbo mortgage originations accounted for 21% of all mortgages in Q1, up from 10% a year earlier.At Bank of America (BAC -1.7%) the down payment required for most jumbos less than $1M was cut this year to 15% from 20%, and nonconforming originations in Q1 were 37% of all mortgages vs. 22% last year.

Buffett/Munger take questions at "Capitalist Woodstock"
He didn't want to "go to war" with management, says Warren Buffett, responding to the first question asked of him at the Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) annual meeting: Why did he abstain from voting on the controversial equity compensation plan for Coca-Cola (KO) executives?"You keep belching at the dinner table, you'll be eating in the kitchen," says Buffett, describing the clubby culture of corporate boards where being agreeable keeps you on the inside and being confrontational gets you blackballed. "I've voted for compensation plans in various places that are far from what I would have designed myself ... That is the way boards work."A shareholder proposal requesting Berkshire board consideration of a dividend received less than 2% of the vote, pleasing to Buffett who believes he and Charlie Munger can do a better job of allocating company capital than returning it to shareholders. Still, with $40B and rising in Berkshire's coffers, even Buffett concedes the day is coming when the company has "more cash than we can intelligently invest.""That error that they made doesn't bother me," says Buffett of Bank of America (BAC), which had to suspend its capital return plan after miscalculating capital levels. "It doesn't change my feeling about Bank of America's risk management one iota."Mungerisms: Comparing Berkshire book value to the S&P 500 is "insane" and makes it harder for Buffett to look good. "Warren sets a ridiculously high standard. The last couple of years added $60B in value ... If that's failure, then I want more of it." May 3, 2014, 7:51 PM | 66 Comments
Cyclical or secular? JPMorgan warns again on trading business
With Q1 results for the global banks just in the books, JPMorgan (JPM) becomes the first to warn on trading revenues in Q2, expecting markets revenue to slip 20% after declining 17% in Q1.SEC Form 10-QAs in the past, the biggest driver of the slide is weakness in fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) as investors continue to shy from exotic fixed-income vehicles contrived by bankers, and instead favor less profitable (for the bond desks) government and high-grade corporate bonds. There's also new regulations which have forced banks away from lucrative businesses like energy trading."I don't look at the $5 billion in markets revenue and cry in my soup," said CEO Jamie Dimon on Q1's earnings call (the bank did $5.37B in trading business in Q1), stressing his belief that the current tough time for trading is cyclical not secular.JPMorgan fell 1.5% in after hours trading following the news last night. Morgan Stanley (MS) -0.5%, Goldman Sachs (GS) -0.1%, Bank of America (BAC) -0.7%, Citigroup (C) -0.4%: "Certainly J.P. Morgan's forecast does not bode well for the other big banks," says RBC's Gerard Cassidy. May 3, 2014, 8:21 AM | 28 Comments
Fed special unit to give extra scrutiny to 15 firms

BofA blunder likely means no buyback this year
Yesterday's selloff in Bank of America (BAC +1.1%) was likely overdone in light of the bank's capital levels, says Morgan Stanley's Betsy Graseck, suggesting the end result will be BofA scrapping a buyback this year, but reinstating the dividend boost (to $0.05 per share quarterly from $0.01). CLSA's Mike Mayo, on the other hand, says the mistake raises doubt about controls, and reiterates his Sell rating.Goldman's Richard Ramsden says the bank likely would have failed this year's CCAR (or come very close) based on the new leverage ratios, and notes the lost capital is about equal to the amount of the buyback. At this point, even if BofA passed the CCAR quantitatively, it could fail qualitatively thanks to its accounting processes. Toss in the pending massive litigation settlement with the DOJ (which has come to light post-CCAR).This will be the first time the Fed has required a bank suspend its capital plan and require a resubmission mid-year, says Ramsden. "In our view this could signal a new level of oversight for banks that wish to continue returning capital when there has been a material change to their risk profile."Previously: Black eye: BofA suspends buyback, dividend hike Apr. 29, 2014, 11:09 AM | 9 Comments
Wells: Reputational damage biggest hit to BofA
"We anticipate Bank of America (BAC -4.6%) will underperform its peers today," is the high-priced conclusion of the team at Wells Fargo after BofA is forced to suspend its capital return plans in the wake of an accounting miscalculation.The actual net effect on the bank's capital will not be too material, says Wells, but reputational damage, upward pressure on expenses, and the idea of a more conservative capital return request next year could weigh on the stock over the next few months (for an example, see BB&T after the 2013 CCAR).Wells currently has a Market Perform rating on the stock.Previously: Black eye: BofA suspends buyback, dividend hike Apr. 28, 2014, 11:05 AM | 14 Comments

BofA slips amid leak of massive global mortgage settlement
Bank of America (BAC) is 1.1% lower in premarket action after last night's leak of the DOJ seeking more than another $13B out of the hide of shareholders over legacy mortgage issues, according to Bloomberg. The settlement would come on top of the $9.5B agreed to by the bank to resolve FHFA claims, and a deal could come within the next two months, according to sources.Most of the loans in question became BofA's problem after it purchased Countrywide and Merrill Lynch - one made the punk loans and the other packaged them into MBS.This deal - which would also resolve state AG charges - would tower over JPMorgan's eye-popper of a $13B settlement from last year, which included $4B for the FHFA.They're coming for your banks next: There are another eight lenders under investigation by the DOJ and state attorneys general over similar charges.ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, KRE, VFH, KBE, IYF, IAI, IAT, SEF, IYG, PFI, FXO, KBWB, FNCL, RKH, QABA, FINU, KRU, RWW, KBWR, RYF, PSCF, FINZ, KRS, AIRR Apr. 25, 2014, 7:41 AM | 46 Comments

BNY Mellon corporate trust unit reportedly on the block
BNY Mellon (BK +2.1%) has hired Goldman Sachs to find a buyer for the unit, reports Bloomberg, and is expected to begin receiving offers in about a month. The corporate trust arm assists companies with making payments on debt they issue as well as helping customers recover funds in event of default.The business services about $12T in outstanding debt, with 3.5K employees at 61 global offices, but has become less lucrative since the financial crisis made the packaging and selling of loans a more difficult business. Possible buyers could be large commercial banks looking to build out their own trust business such as Bank of America (BAC), U.S. Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo (WFC), or PNC Financial, says Guggenheim's Marty Mosby.On a recent earnings call, BNY management said run-off in the unit would cut annual revenue by $50M-$75M annually, roughly 0.5% of total bank revenue.

Merrill raises the bar for top broker recognition
Merrill Lynch's (BAC -0.5%) top recognition club previously was its "Circle of Champions" for wealth managers who produced $4M of commissions, but now - in a sign the company expects new programs and technologies to unleash new sales power - the "Pinnacle Club" will pay brokers $10K in cash and additional benefits if they break $8M in revenue.Reporting results last week, Merrill said its Thundering Herd was on target to produce $1.06M each this year, one of the top figures in the industry. That average, however, is skewed by the top rainmakers - some of whom will qualify for the club.Spokespeople at Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and UBS - whose recognition clubs top out at $2M-$3M in annual revenue - did not immediately respond to questions on their plans for those levels.

Consumer banking costs fell 4% from last year, he notes.

New rules forces largest banks to hold another $68B in capital
Finalizing the criteria on the eight largest banks' leverage ratios - a minimum 5% at the holding company level and 6% at the bank subsidiary level - U.S. regulators impose a far tougher standard than international norms of 3%.The eight affected: BK, BAC, C, GS, JPM, MS, STT, WFC.The regulators at work were the Fed, the FDIC, and the OCC, and the Fed's Dan Tarullo indicates he wants to go further, signaling the central bank may boost the risk-based capital surcharge to a higher level than the international standard. The most to lose in this scenario would be investment banks like Goldman and Morgan Stanley who don't have the deposit bases of their retail brethren.Banks have until January 1, 2018 to comply with the new rule.Related ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, IAI, SEF, IYG, FXO, PFI, KBWB, FNCL, FINU, KCE, RWW, RYF, PSCF, FINZ, KBWC Apr. 8, 2014, 4:43 PM | 19 Comments

Regulators set to vote on rule to increase bank leverages
Regulators are due to vote today on whether to increase the "leverage ratio" for the eight largest U.S. banks to 5-6% of their total assets. The Basel III standard is 3%.The move would force banks to add tens of billions of dollars in loss-absorbing capital, although many firms have already been bulking up in anticipation of the rule change.Meanwhile, the Fed has given banks two extra years - until July 2017 - to ensure that their collateralized loan obligations (CLO) comply with the Volcker rule's restrictions on speculative investments.

Too Big To Fail not solved, says IMF
Absent reforms, another financial crisis is likely to leave taxpayers on the hook for hundreds of billions, warns the IMF, estimating the world's biggest banks receive up to $590B in implicit public subsidies because of their TBTF status.Said subsidies include bankers who still have a "heads I win, tails you lose" attitude, and investors who lend at lower cost to banks than they might otherwise. The IMF calculated the size of the subsidies by comparing the CDS prices and credit ratings across larger and smaller banks. While the amount has fallen since the crisis, it still remains sizable. "All in all ... the expected probability that systemically important banks will be bailed out remains high in all regions."Subsidies for the biggest players are "like insurance for which banks don't need to pay a premium," says senior IMF analyst Gaston Gelos.Full report (starting on pg. 34)Among the usual suspects: BBVA, BBD, BAC, BCS, BK, BNS, C, CS, DB, GS, HSBC, IBN, ING, JPM, LYG, MS, NBG, RY, STT, TD, UBS, WFC, WBK.

A check of payout ratios allowed by CCAR process
Count Credit Suisse's Moshe Orenbuch as surprised about the Fed's denial of Citigroup's (C -0.5%) capital return plan. Maybe Citi is just too tough for regulators to get their arms around as it is the most complicated of all the bank holding companies.Included in the Credit Suisse report is this handy chart of dividends, buybacks, and payout ratios for all of the CCAR banks for 2013 and 2014. Things are loosening up - the median payout ratio (includes dividends and buybacks) this year of 71% compares to 59% in 2013. The dividend payout ratio rises to 26% from 23%.It helps to be smaller - among the TBTFs, Citi's payout ratio is just 8%, BofA (BAC) 37%, JPMorgan (JPM) 56%, Morgan Stanley (MS) 41%. Wells Fargo is above the median though, being allowed a payout of 79%.The regionals (KRE), trust banks, and credit card companies - for the most part - were all allowed payout ratios above the median.The strongest capital returns vs. CS's expectations are those for BNY Mellon (BK), Capital One (COF), KeyCorp (KEY), Huntington Bancshares (HBAN), PNC Financial, and Wells Fargo.ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, KRE, VFH, KBE, IYF, IAT, SEF, IYG, FXO, PFI, KBWB, FNCL, RKH, QABA, FINU, KRU, RWW, KBWR, RYF, PSCF, KRS, FINZ, AIRR Mar. 28, 2014, 11:41 AM | 4 Comments
Blow to government as judge recommends dismissal of case against BofA
Filed last summer, the lawsuit alleges Bank of America (BAC) made misstatements about mortgages sown up in $850M of MBS in 2008, but Judge David Cayer recommends it be tossed for two technical reasons, notably that the government doesn't demonstrate the alleged misstatements were material to the GSE's decision to buy the paper.

Investors ratchet down bank capital return outlook
It's a slow grind for bank capital returns (at least those subject to the CCAR), notes Goldman' Richard Ramsden, with payout ratios boosted just four percentage points to 62% this year. There are clear winners, he says: The credit card companies led by AXP and COF and the trust banks led by BK. Regional banks (KRE) boosted returns but generally fell short of expectations (with HBAN and PNC being the exceptions). Worst-performing were the TBTFs, though JPM and WFC were positives."CCAR highlighted the challenges large-caps have in returning excess capital," he says, with Citigroup's (C) failure a reminder the process is unpredictable. With all that excess capital remaining on the balance sheet, Ciit's 2015 goal of a 10% ROTCE appears unlikely to be met.For Bank of America (BAC), it's resubmission - a better outcome than outright failure - reminds that even well-capitalized banks are "bound by stressed capital and could have trouble returning outsized capital."ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, KRE, VFH, KBE, IYF, IAT, SEF, IYG, FXO, PFI, KBWB, FNCL, RKH, QABA, FINU, KRU, RWW, KBWR, RYF, PSCF, KRS, FINZ, AIRR Mar. 27, 2014, 8:36 AM | 6 Comments

The process is spread out over a week so that banks can alter their programs if they don't receive Fed authorization.Last year, the Fed told JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) to change their capital-allocation plans.The Fed's decision will come a week after it said that 29 out of 30 banks had passed its stress tests.Relevant tickers include C, MS, BAC, BK, AXP, COF, C, FITB, PNC, RF, STT, STI, USB, WFC, ZION.ETFs of interest: KBE, KBWB, KRE, KCE, KBWC, XLF, IYF, PFI, VFH, RYF, RWW, FAS, UYG, FAZ, SKF, SEF, IAI, FXO, PSCF, KBWD, KBWB, IYG, FINU, FINZ.

BofA still a Buy at Citi after marginal stress test result
Capital return estimates for Bank of America (BAC -0.3%) look a "tad" too high, says Citi's Keith Horowitz, following BofA's getting just a passing grade from the Fed's stress test - its Tier 1 common equity ratio of 5.9% (corrected from the original 6%) under the Fed's adverse economic scenario was the lowest among the 29 of 30 banks which passed.Horowitz previously estimated BofA would go for a $5B buyback and a $0.03 boost to its dividend (currently just $0.01), but he's thinking a slightly dialed-back repurchase plan may be in order.Investors will find out after the bell on Wednesday just how close the bank has decided to cut it. Nevertheless, Horowitz would buy any dip should the capital return announcement prove disappointing. Mar. 25, 2014, 11:34 AM | 5 Comments
BofA downgraded amid capital return worries; USB and Wells upgraded
Noting Bank of America's (BAC -0.9%) capital ratio in the Fed stress test was the lowest of any bank which passed, Atlantic Equities pulls its Overweight rating on the stock, and cuts the price target to $18.50 from $20. The stress test, says analyst Richard Staite, shows BofA with a $13B buffer over the minimum requirement, meaning maybe just $5B in buybacks and $2.5B dividends this year, "although we are somewhat nervous that it or another bank could be failed on a qualitative basis."Still, Staite expects a boost in the quarterly payout to $0.06 per share from a penny.Staite and team upgrade U.S. Bancorp (USB +0.7%) and Wells Fargo (WFC -0.4%) to Neutral from Underweight, citing the large margins by which they passed the stress test.In other financial sector moves, Sterne Agee boosts First Interstate BancSystem (FIBK +6%) to a Buy, citing the benefits of its impending merger with Mountain West Financial. The team also lifts EverBank Financial (EVER +2.4%) to a Buy from Neutral. Mar. 24, 2014, 2:54 PM | 13 Comments
TBTFs pass stress tests, but don't get an "A"
It's a sluggish day for the TBTFs after yesterday's post-close stress test results. Satiated investors may be selling the news, or perhaps the lenders didn't pass with enough flying colors.Credit Suisse's Moshe Orenbuch's team had estimated a Tier 1 common ratio under the severely adverse scenario of 8.6% for Bank of America (BAC -1.5%), but it came in at just 6% from the Fed - only 100 basis points higher than the minimum. Citigroup (C -0.1%) - estimated at 10% - came in at 7%, JPMorgan (JPM +0.4%) - estimated at 6.5% - came in at 6.3%.Morgan Stanley (MS -0.5%), meanwhile, missed CS's estimate by a whopping 400 basis points, while Goldman missed by 170. "Not surprisingly, the capital markets sensitive banks appear on the lower end of the range given losses associated with a large counterparty default, in addition to higher trading losses vs. regional bank peers," says Orenbuch.Jefferies' Ken Usdin says the lower numbers confirm the "teeth" of the stress tests. "Our initial take is that discrepancies were largely driven by higher charge-off and balance sheet growth assumptions used by the Fed."ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, IAI, SEF, IYG, FXO, PFI, KBWB, FNCL, FINU, RWW, KCE, RYF, PSCF, FINZ, KBWC Mar. 21, 2014, 3:10 PM | 5 Comments

BofA reportedly cutting trading and investment banking jobs

The TBTFs join to fight proposed bank tax
Half a million doesn't buy much anymore. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R, Mich.) - a sizable recipient of Wall Street donations - has the large financial institutions displeased with his proposal to levy a tax on them. He says they deserve to pay up for the lower borrowing costs they receive because of their perceived government backstop, a notion the banks dispute.The proposal is part of larger tax reform expected to get serious discussion after the mid-term elections, and a Camp spokeswoman says the overall plan will make banks "some of the biggest winners."In discussions to hold a fundraiser for the NRC, Goldman Sachs (GS +0.9%) reportedly opted out over its concerns. Smaller bankers join in with their much larger brethren: "We're going to beat this like a rented mule," says Cam Fine, who heads the Independent Community Bankers Association. "This is a united effort."Camp's tax would apply to financial firms with assets greater than $500B, levying a 0.035% tax on total assets each year. Among those affected (in addition to Goldman) are AIG, BAC, C, GE Capital, JPM MET, MS, PRU, and WFC. The largest could pay more than $2B per year under the plan.

BAML looks to boost emerging markets business
Michele Foresti departs Deutsche Bank - where he was a top exec in fixed-income sales and trading - to take the helm of Bank of America's (BAC +0.1%) FICC trading in EMEA, reports the WSJ, citing a bank memo.Previous FICC trading chief Bernard Mensah will take over a newly combined FICC emerging markets business, according to the memo. The new unit combines the emerging markets (ex-Asia) operation already under Mensah's responsibility with the bank's Asia Pacific emerging market local currency unit. Its formation reflects “the growth and increased importance” of BAML's emerging markets franchise, says the memo. Mar. 12, 2014, 12:55 PM | 1 Comment

Bank of America's latest effort to raise revenue from basic checking
It's latest effort to try and wring revenue from its most basic banking product (and a loss leader), Bank of America (BAC +0.9%) today begins offering "Safe Balance" - a checkless account for customers with low balances for a monthly fee of $4.95. The account won't allow overdrafts, so it could make sense for those depositors whose balances sometimes fall to zero, causing them to get stuck with overdraft fees.This effort looks to be a little more well-prepared than previous efforts in 2011 and 2012 which drew swift regulatory and customer blowback and were quickly withdrawn. "We've been doing a lot of listening to customers, doing a lot of meetings with regulators and [consumer] advocates," says BofA's Andrew Plepler. "Predictability, safety, no surprises, no hidden fees is a recurring theme."The stock hit a 4-year high earlier in the session, before pulling back a bit. Mar. 6, 2014, 11:39 AM | 18 Comments

Big banks sport big gains ahead of stress test results
Buying the rumor? On a flattish day for the major averages, the Too Big To Fail banks are ignoring a continued slowdown in markets revenue this quarter, and instead partying ahead of what may be the imminent release of the Fed's stress test results (perhaps Friday). About one week later will be CCAR results at which the Fed gives the thumbs up or thumbs down on the banks' capital return plans.Word is the tests are tougher this year, but bank capital levels are also improved.Leading today is Bank of America (BAC +3%) - now within about one percent of a 4-year high. Others: Morgan Stanley (MS +2.8%), Goldman Sachs (GS +1.8%), Ciitgroup (C +1%), JPMorgan (JPM +1.5%), and Wells Fargo (WFC +0.6%).Also subject to the stress tests are a number of regional lenders, not to mention credit card players - they're mixed in today's action.Related ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, KRE, VFH, KBE, IYF, IAI, IAT, SEF, IYG, FXO, PFI, KBWB, RKH, QABA, FNCL, FINU, KCE, KRU, RWW, KBWR, RYF, PSCF, KRS, FINZ, KBWC Mar. 5, 2014, 3:42 PM | 8 Comments

He continues to have a Hold rating on the name with $55 price targetThe move comes after CFO John Gerspach - speaking at an institutional investor conference on Monday  - said markets revenues this quarter were off by a high mid-teens percentage, investment banking revenue was tracking lower, and expenses headed higher.Credit Suisse's Moshe Orenbuch cut his Q1 forecast to $1.21 from $1.41 and FY14 to $5 from $5.25. He still rates the stock an Outperform with $65 price target.JPMorgan (JPM +0.9%) - at its investor day last week - was the first of the big banks to signal the greater-than-expected trading revenue slowdown, and KBW's Chris Mutascio lowered his Q1 EPS estimate to $1.38 from $1.43 and FY14 to $5.90 from $5.95. He's got an Outperform and $63 price target on the shares.Bank of America (BAC +1.8%) swims in the same waters, and Orenbuch lowered his Q1 numbers to $0.19 from $0.24 and FY14 to $1.30 from $1.35.

BofA and Buffett amend deal
Under the new terms - which require shareholder approval - Bank of America (BAC) is prohibited from redeeming the $2.9B in preferred stock issued to Berkshire (BRK.A, BRK.B) for five years and the stock will continue to pay a 6% dividend. The dividends, however, will no longer be cumulative, meaning the bank won't be penalized if forced to skip a payment.In exchange, BofA will be able to count the $2.9B as Tier 1 capital - a good deal for the bank which faces ever-more-stringent capital requirements.Buffett originally invested $5B in BofA in 2011, acquiring the preferred stock along with warrants struck at $7.14 and expiring in 2021 allowing the purchase of 700M shares - thus far a home run.Regulatory filing Mar. 3, 2014, 7:47 AM | 16 Comments

Don't expect a lot from bank stress test results this year says Citi
With bank capital levels really no longer in question, don't expect any big pops in the banks surrounding the stress tests and CCAR results, says Citi in its "2014 CCAR Playbook." If anything - given that the stress tests are supposedly tougher this year - the risk to banks could be on the downside.The team expects the stress test results - which looks at bank balance sheets under different scenarios - sometime around March 7 and the CCAR results - on which the Fed approves/disapproves capital return plans - about a week later.Look for modestly higher average gross payout ratios of 62% vs. 55% last year. Individual banks: BAC 11% dividend (payout ratio) + 32% buyback for 43%; BBT 33% dividend +19% buyback; FITB 32% dividend + 37% buyback; JPM 27% dividend + 18% buyback; WFC 28% dividend + 43% buyback; GS 14% dividend + 78% buyback for an industry-leading payout ratio of 91%; MTB 34% dividend + 0% buyback; MS 17% dividend + 36% buyback; PNC 31% dividend + 49% buyback; USB 30% dividend +46% buyback.Related ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, KRE, VFH, KBE, IYF, IAI, IAT, SEF, IYG, FXO, PFI, KBWB, RKH, QABA, FINU, FNCL, KCE, KRU, RWW, KBWR, RYF, PSCF, KRS, FINZ, KBWC Feb. 25, 2014, 12:59 PM | 4 Comments
Markit expects major dividend hikes at BofA and Citi
Expecting dividends to grow 49% on average for the banks subject to the Fed's stress tests (about the same as last year), Markit, says Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) will lead the way with 400% boosts. "They are the last of the major banks paying minimal dividends ... change is overdue."While 400% is a big number, Citi and BofA will continue to lag their peers in terms of yield (400% growth on a penny just leads to a nickel).Also expected to have a significant pop is Morgan Stanley (MS) - a doubling of the payout to $0.10 per share and a 1.4% yield. Others in the top 5 in increases are Zions Bancorp (ZION) with a 75% boost to $0.07 and Regions Financial (RF) up 67% to $0.05.The others: KEY +27%, HBAN +20%, BK +20%, STI +20%, COF +17%, DFS +15%, AXP +13%, STT +12%, JPM +11%, CMA +11%, PNC +9%, USB +9%, GS +9%, FITB +8%, WFC +7%, NTRS +6%, and no soup for BBT and MTB where the dividends are expected to be flat at $0.23 and $0.70 per share, respectively.As for ETFs, the dividend jumps are expected to have the biggest impact on the XLF which would see a 25% increase in payout: The ETF has 81 companies, but the top 5 holdings - BofA, Wells, JPM, Citi, USB - make up 41% of assets. In contrast, just two CCAR banks make up the top five holdings of the KBE and it should see a more muted increase of just 18%.Related ETFs: XLF, FAS, FAZ, UYG, KRE, VFH, KBE, IYF, IAT, SEF, IYG, FXO, PFI, KBWB, RKH, QABA, FNCL, FINU, KRU, RWW, KBWR, RYF, PSCF, KRS, FINZ Feb. 20, 2014, 3:29 PM | 13 Comments
Moynihan gets raise of 17% in 2013
The Bank of America (BAC +0.6%) board approved $14M for CEO Brian Moynihan, according a regulatory filing. Of that, $1.5M was his regular salary and $12.5M was stock grants, but there was no bonus despite a big move in the stock and profits that rose to $11.4B from $4.2B in 2012. The $1.5M salary will remain unchanged this year."They didn’t give him an outrageous raise,” says an executive search exec. “They’re also looking at how the outside world views this, and so they were relatively conservative.” Perhaps Moynihan should angle for the Chairman's slot.

BofA $8.5B mortgage settlement back in court

While a NY state judge upheld Bank of America's (BAC -0.8%) $8.5B mortgage settlement with private investors, the dissident investors - led by AIG - have asked a new judge presiding over the case (the original judge has been promoted) to take another look, and she has agreed to do so.Lawyers for investors who support the settlement like BlackRock and MetLife sent a letter to the new judge reminding the dissidents own just 7% of the securities in question and are holding "the entire settlement hostage indefinitely." Should the judge allow a new hearing, they are requesting AIG be required to post about $1M per day to cover the costs a stay would have on those who want their settlement monies.

Wells Fargo (WFC -1.1%) added $4.2B in brand value in 2013 to reach a total of $30.2B, according to Brand Finance.

New York drops effort to win damages from BofA over Merrill
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman won't seek damages from Bank of America (BAC) over its $18.5B acquisition of Merrill Lynch during the financial crisis in 2009.However, Schneiderman will still pursue the lawsuit and seek an injunction that would ban former BofA CEO Kenneth Lewis and ex-CFO Joe Price from the securities industry and from being directors of public companies.Schneiderman has accused BofA of misleading shareholders over the scale of losses at Merrill and bonus payouts in order to win authorization for the deal, and of manipulating the federal government to provide bailout loans.In 2012, BofA agreed to pay stockholders $2.43B to settle a lawsuit over losses they made because of the Merrill Lynch transaction.

Banks stay mum on litigation reserves
Notably not disclosing its litigation reserve this quarter was JPMorgan (JPM -0.2%), which had taken the unusual step of doing so last October (it was $23B) ahead of the major DOJ settlement.Even as litigation has become of such material import to banks, the lenders generally don't disclose how much they've set aside for settlements and fines. The reason is clear: Whatever number that may be becomes a target for opposing attorneys.“I definitely feel that the disclosures around this aren’t great ... I thought JPMorgan disclosing it was going to put pressure on more banks to start doing it,” says Goldman's Richard Ramsden. Most don't believe banks are sitting on catastrophically low reserves (BAC has paid in about $50B to its reserve since the financial crisis, says Bernstein), and the number can often be pieced together, but it's hard to know sometimes what banks have drawn down to settle cases.While the SEC has asked lenders to offer better disclosure on things like European bond holdings, it has requested nothing on litigation reserves, though they're causing more financial pain than Europe is.

BofA price target hiked at Jefferies
"Positive deltas include higher NIM, better I-banking fees, and a lower tax rate, with higher revenue-related costs, less reserve release, and elevated near-term litigation costs partial offsets," says analyst Ken Usdin, raising the price target on Buy-rated Bank of America (BAC -0.6%) to $20 from $19 following yesterday's Q4 report.

BofA branch declines continue as mobile banking grows
"You know what we know," says Bank of America (BAC +3.3%) CFO Bruce Thompson, responding to a question about the Article 77 hearing on approving/throwing out the bank's $8.5B private investor settlement over MBS. The trial is over, says Thompson, and the parties await the judge's ruling.Mobile banking continues to take share and the number of branches - which fell to 5,151 in Q4 from 5,478 a year earlier - could drop to less than 5K by year's end, says Thompson. Mobile banking customers of 14.4M compares to 14M in Q3 and 12M a year ago. Yesterday, JPMorgan announced its dropped plans to add new branches.CC webcast and slidesIt was a "very strong" quarter, says Goldman's Richard Ramsden, who puts core EPS at something closer to $0.39 (vs. his expectation for $0.31), rather than the $0.29 reported. "Even normalizing for lower market-related NII and lower reserve releases, today's result makes next year's consensus estimate of $1.32 look very achievable, particularly given remaining cost leverage from LAS and New BAC."Previous earnings coverage Jan. 15, 2014, 10:03 AM
Big quarter for BofA detailed in earnings call
"We still have not approached the true earnings potential of Bank of America (BAC)," says CEO Brian Moynihan, leading off the earnings call. The bank reported EPS of $0.29, beating estimates for $0.26, but adjusting for DVA, litigation, and the artificially low tax rate brings core EPS up to $0.42, notes Hedgeye's Josh Steiner.CC webcast and presentation slidesDeclining to answer a question about the Fed stress tests and BofA's capital return plans (will the nominal $0.01 dividend be hiked this year), CFO Bruce Thompson notes the bank's Tier 1 common capital ratio is around 9%, higher than the proposed 8.5% minimum which doesn't take effect until 2019.The bank cut 5,826 jobs in Q4 - with the cuts coming in branches and mortgage servicing/origination.Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) investors take note: BofA's FICC revenue of $2.1B jumped 16% Y/Y. JPMorgan yesterday reported a 1% Y/Y gain vs. expectations for an 11% decline. The Street expects Goldman to report a 23% decline (after Q3's 44% tumble) and Morgan Stanley an 8% increase. Is a positive surprise looming?BAC +2.9% premarket to $17.25, the highest price in nearly 4 years. Jan. 15, 2014, 9:03 AM
BofA up 2% premarket after Q4 results
Net interest income of $11B, up 4% Y/Y, with net interest margin growing to 2.56% from 2.35% a year ago.Noninterest income of $10.7B, up 28% Y/Y, thanks to lower provisions for reps and warranties, and improvement in investment banking and brokerage income (global wealth management income of $777M, up 35%). Credit loss provisions of $336M are $1.9B lower than a year ago. Net charge offs of $1.6B in the Q compare to $3.1B a year ago.Expense cutting remains on track: Noninterest expense of $17.3B is down 6% Y/Y, thanks to job cuts in Legacy Assets and Servicing (LAS). Full-time equivalent employees fall 9% in 2013 to 242K. This was offset by litigation expenses rising to $2.3B in Q4 from $1.1B in Q3 and $916M a year ago.Like with Wells Fargo and JPMorgan, mortgage business continues to disappear, with first-mortgage originations falling 46% Y/Y and core production revenue falling to $403M from $986M. The difference - at least as far as with Wells Fargo - is the mortgage business makes up for a far smaller chunk of BAC's business.CC at 8:30 ETBAC +2% premarket Jan. 15, 2014, 7:21 AM | 8 Comments

Nomura likes BofA and Citi as it starts coverage
"Multi-year capital/cost initiatives have prepared Bank of America (BAC) for a tougher capital regime, and its strong position supports meaningfully higher payouts vs. peers, in our view," says analyst Steven Chubak, initiating coverage with a Buy and $19 price target."BAC's current business mix, improving efficiency, and higher rate sensitivity should support ~15% mid-cycle returns (on required capital) by 2016. Legal costs should remain elevated, but analysis suggests BAC is only moderately under-reserved for remaining Private Label exposure. Long-term ROE potential of ~15% supports PT of $19, or 14% potential upside.""We see unparalleled ROE potential at Citigroup (C) under the new capital rules, as Citicorp efficiency targets are realized by 2015 and Citi Holdings turns profitable," he says, starting the bank at a Buy with $70 price target."We also see significant excess capital generation/best-in-class payout potential as the drag from Holdings moderates and DTA utilization accelerates. The above trends support through-the-cycle ROE potential of 15% and payout ratios >100%, which are not properly reflected in the shares, in our view."BAC +0.5%, C +0.4% premarketSee also: Nomura launches JPM and MS at Neutral Jan. 9, 2014, 7:54 AM | 7 Comments
Credit card portfolio growing at BofA
Lending growth is coming back at Back of America (BAC +0.7%) where the credit card portfolio - typically shrinking since the financial bust - grew in Q3. Don't look for the unit to return to pre-crisis size anytime soon though, as the bank has made a strategic choice to focus lending on existing customers - this saves money on marketing and assures BofA knows a little bit more about who it's doing business with. "The card business will be smaller, but less volatile and more profitable," says Titi Cole, a senior exec for retail products.Even by focusing on its own customers, CEO Brian Moynihan reminds the opportunity is huge ... "tens of millions of customers," he told a conference late last year. The bank issued 1M new credit cards in Q3 and Q4 issuance is expected to be strong as well. Jan. 8, 2014, 11:39 AM | 1 Comment
Largest lenders cementing their market share
Despite constant concerns about banks that are "too big too fail," the amount of assets that the U.S.'s five largest lenders control has grown to 44.2% of the total in the sector from 43.5% in 2012, a report from provider SNL Financial shows.In 2007, the figure was 38.4% and in 1990 it was just 9.67%.The banking operations of JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC) and U.S. Bancorp (USB) held $6.46T in assets as of Q3 2013.The easing of regulation, which gained momentum in the 1990s, encouraged consolidation in the sector, as did the government pushing stronger banks to buy those that were about to collapse - or did collapse - because of the financial crisis in 2008.ETFs: FAS, XLF, FAZ, UYG, KRE, VFH, KBE, IYF, SEF, IAT, IYG, PFI, FXO, KBWB, KME, RKH, QABA, KRU, FINU, RWW, KBWR, RYF, PSCF, FNCL, KRS, FINZ Jan. 5, 2014, 1:23 AM | 12 Comments

Bank of America (BAC +2.2%) tacks more onto yesterday 3.4% move, touching its highest level in nearly three years.Yesterday's catalyst looked to be an upgrade from Citi, but that report added little to the widely-known bull case on BofA.

Banks could face tougher stress tests next year
The Fed intends to use its own estimates about the effect of a recession on bank balance sheets in its stress tests. Previously, the Fed has relied on data from the firms themselves.The central bank could project that bank assets would grow during a slump, as has happened in the past three recessions, rather than fall, as the banks have predicted.With such a finding, the Fed could require banks to hold more loss-absorbing capital or limit shareholder payouts.

Details of Volcker rule set to be unveiled
A panoply of regulators are due to disclose the details of the Volcker rule this morning and then formally adopt the measures later in the day.The new regulations will ban banks from proprietary trading, and prevent them from owning over 3% of hedge funds and private-equity funds.Banks fear that the rules could cost them billions of dollars by making it more difficult to engage in activities that are permitted under the regulation, such as market-making, underwriting and hedging against risks.

Blow to banks' hedging in Volcker Rule
The Too Big To Fail banks lead to the downside amid a report the set-to-be-voted on Volcker rule will not contain language allowing portfolio hedging - trades supposedly designed to protect against losses in a broad portfolio of assets.Banks can thank JPMorgan's (JPM -1.7%) London Whale fiasco for this as the Whale's trades were ostensibly set up for this portfolio hedging, but ended up costing the bank $6B.The move is a big blow to the banks which had sent their big lobbying guns in to try and prevent the disallowing of this practice. Banks often hedge to offset risks from trading with clients, but often there is no great hedge, and this is where portfolio hedging comes in ... or used to."Volcker has morphed a bit, thanks to the Whale," says UBS' Brennan Hawken. "Now a big component of it has become about hedging. What can you hedge, and what can't you? It's really unclear." The CFTC and SEC are each set to vote on the rule on Dec. 10.Citigroup (C -1.9%), Bank of America (BAC -1.2%), Goldman Sachs (GS -1%), Morgan Stanley (MS -2.2%). Dec. 5, 2013, 12:01 PM | 32 Comments

Banks cited for non-compliance with mortgage settlement
Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C -1.3%), and JPMorgan (JPM +0.5%) each failed at least 2 of 29 metrics used to gauge compliance with the national $25B mortgage settlement, according to a court filing from Joseph Smith, the watchdog overseeing the process. The last report - filed in June - cited JPM, Citi, and Wells Fargo for missing on 3 metrics.The failures stem from the complexity of the banks' systems, says Smith, and fixes can be expensive, but all the banks have implemented plans to address to issues.In one example, BofA failed on one test as to whether loans were actually delinquent at the time foreclosure was initiated, and another about how quickly it was notifying borrowers of missing documents in their loan modification applications.

Banks about to get clarity on prop trading
The CFTC sets a December 10 vote on the so-called Volcker rule which is supposed to ban banks from prop trading. It sounded so simple when politicians trumpeted it in 2010, but the reality of what banks do is slightly more complex and the text of the rule has mushroomed to 1K pages. GS, MS, JPM, BAC, and C, among others, will be eager to see what the regulations entail.Any hopes for a watering-down of the rule likely ended with JPMorgan's $6B London Whale loss.The SEC indicates it will act on the rule around the same time as the CFTC (3 other agencies must approve as well).Related ETFs: FAS, XLF, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, SEF, IAI, IYG, PFI, FXO, KBWB, KCE, RWW, FINU, RYF, PSCF, FNCL, FINZ, KBWC Dec. 3, 2013, 3:50 PM | 8 Comments
Banks expect to make mortgages outside of new standard
The nation's largest retail banks - WFC, BAC, C, and JPM - all expect to originate mortgages beginning in January falling outside of the standards mandated by Washington. To review, Dodd-Frank doesn't prohibit mortgages not meeting the definition of a so-called qualified mortgage (as defined by the CFPB), but banks can face greater legal liability on those loans.The impact of the new rules has yet to be seen, but the worry is they would curtail lending at the exact time when it ought to be encouraged. At this point, the bank's lending outside of these standards looks like it will be mostly to affluent customers (jumbo mortgages), and not a large proportion of total activity. Wells estimates about 5% of its lending this year wouldn't fall within QM guidelines.Wells' EVP of home mortgages Brad Blackwell: "It's clear the borrowers we're lending to today have an ability to repay ... We don't see a significant reason to contract our lending...because these are very high-quality borrowers."Deutsche estimates 13% of jumbo loans made since 2010 wouldn't be "qualified" mortgages.

Additional legal tab for banks could exceed $100B
"Mortgage-related litigation has recently gotten a second wind and has expanded beyond investor claims,” says S&P, now estimating legal tab for U.S. banks could be another $56.5B-$104B. The good news is banks have gotten ahead of even these crazy numbers by boosting litigation reserves to nearly $155B.The bad news would be if Bank of America's (BAC) $8.5B mortgage settlement with private parties gets tossed out by a federal judge (see Article 77 hearing coverage), the litigation losses could "escalate significantly ...  the ability of US banks with the largest exposures to withstand additional expenses is not unlimited.”C, WFC, MS, JPM, and GS declined to comment for the story.From the Department of Legal Issues Are Going Nowhere: The Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh - claiming its losses of more than $1B are not covered by the JPMorgan global settlement - asks a judge to force JPM to turn over the draft complain from the DOJ which includes the name of a bank employee described as a cooperating witness for the government.Related ETFs: FAS, XLF, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, SEF, IAI, IYG, FXO, PFI, KBWB, KCE, FINU, RWW, RYF, PSCF, FNCL, FINZ, KBWC Nov. 27, 2013, 9:22 AM | 7 Comments

Mayo refreshes bearish view on BofA
"Don't confuse brains with a bull market," writes Mike Mayo, reiterating his long-held (relative) bearish stance on Bank of America (BAC) and its leader Brian Moynihan. Yes, the shares have done well, but so has the market, particularly the banks. BofA, says Mayo, has trailed the KBW Bank Index by 5800 basis points since Moynihan took over in 2010.It's a muddled message, says Mayo, to put slimming-down efforts front and center while also bragging about the size and scope of the bank. One of the areas of retreat - the mortgage business in 2011 - cost the bank billions, he says.Also at issue is the bank's decision to measure progress using different metrics than previously. “We’ve reviewed several annual reports and presentations and can’t seem to connect the aspirational pie-in-the-sky statements with progress reports ... (it) raises questions about data integrity, consistency and information systems." Nov. 13, 2013, 8:01 AM | 16 Comments
Trend of bank branch closings continues
The net closing of bank branches continues a mutliquarter trend, according to SNL Financial, which finds a net loss of 390 locations in Q3 as more customers do more routine banking business online, and banks - in a sluggish revenue environment - look to the low-hanging fruit of shuttering underperforming stores. The 390 figure is about inline with Q2, but higher than prior reads."There's almost nobody in the branches," says bank consultant Jim Adkins. "You could shoot water balloons all over the place and not hit anybody."In addition to costs and technology, there's also M&A, and one of the first things to be done after an acquisition is to close overlapping branches.Leading the way in terms of net closings in Q3 were SunTrust (STI) and Bank of America (BAC). Not getting in the spirit of things is JPMorgan (JPM) which opened more branches than it closed in Q3.Related ETFs: FAS, XLF, FAZ, UYG, VFH, IYF, SEF, IYG, FXO, PFI, KBWB, RWW, FINU, RYF, PSCF, FINZ, FNCL Nov. 12, 2013, 3:31 PM
Moynihan touts BofA's growth opportunities in a tough environment
"We're coming out of the harbor and it's time to take this huge battleship to cruising speed," says Bank of America (BAC +0.1%) CEO Brian Moynihan, kicking off his company's financial services conference (webcast) with a fireside chat.Where's growth going to come from? Consumer credit cards, for one, says Moynihan, noting the bank two years ago was doling out about 700K new cards per quarter vs. 1.1M in the most recent quarter - and all of the growth was done through selling to the existing customer base. There are still millions of customers to tap, and then there's the need to boost activity levels - there remains plenty of room to grow.The business owners Moynihan talks to are "cautiously optimistic," and consumers have been spending at a fairly good clip ... "(We've) just got to make sure we don't talk them out of spending."

Should a deal come, it would be the 2nd between the bank and the GSE - in January 2011, BofA settled with Freddie, but only over mortgages sold by Countrywide.Past precedence suggests the bank may pay more than the amount of the claims in order to prevent any new repurchase demands from materializing. FHFA chief Ed DeMarco has requested the GSEs put to bed these legacy issues by the end of this year.Bank of America has also had two similar settlements with Fannie Mae.

U.S. derides Countrywide's "Hustle" program, wants $864M from Bank of America
The U.S. government is seeking the maximum penalty allowed under the law from Bank of America (BAC) in connection with a Countrywide loan program dubbed "Hustle."As its name implies, the program was designed "to speed the production and sale of loans to mortgage-finance firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac," WSJ says."The nature and circumstances of Defendants' conduct demonstrates an unyielding and brazen arrogance," a court filing alleges. The government wants $864M in penalties.Here's a BAC spokesman: "We believe the filing overstates the volume of loans and appropriate measure of damages." Nov. 9, 2013, 9:16 PM | 38 Comments
Life insurers and banks welcome higher rates
Up sharply as interest rates fly higher (the 10-year is up 15 basis points to 2.75%) are the life insurers - all of whom have had their investment returns more than a little constrained by puny yields. IAK +2.4% MetLife (MET +5.9%), Prudential (PRU +4.5%), Lincoln National (LNC +6.8%), Hartford (HIG +3.1%).Also set to benefit from a steeper yield curve (if we're to believe their models) are the banks, and they're leading the S&P 500 higher.

Moynihan plays its coy on legal tussles
"What’s fair and unfair is a debate I have at 10 o’clock at night by myself," says Bank of America (BAC +0.3%) CEO Brian Moynihan at a WSJ event. He was responding to a question about whether the government is unfairly shaking down the big banks for misdeeds prior to and during the financial crisis. He reminds the audience BofA has spent more than $40B to date trying to put the legal issues behind it.As for the economy, Moynihan says he saw no break in consumer spending during the financial crisis. While mortgage business is down at BofA (and the entire banking sector), it's not indicative of a weakening housing market as it's refinancing which has dropped off - purchase originations continue to trend higher.

CS: Investors may want to dial back bank capital return hopes
New CCAR guidelines are largely inline with last year, says the team at Credit Suisse, but some variables pose more onerous assumptions and could keep capital distributions more conservative than otherwise expected, though still improved from last year.The incorporation of a large counterparty default scenario is particularly of note for those banks with material trading and custodial operations. The bar for CCAR passage is thus raised for: BAC, BK, C, GS, JPM, MS, STT, and WFC.Additionally, the weakening of economic activity in the severely adverse scenario appears worse than last year. Also included is a reversal in the recent improvement in U.S. housing and the European economy.Those best-positioned for excess capital deployment: AXP, HBAN, KEY, NTRS, RF, and USB. Bank of New York, Goldman, State Street, and Wells Fargo all have the honor of ending up on both lists.ETFs: KBE, KBWB. Nov. 5, 2013, 12:48 PM
Investor lawsuit against BofA dismissed
It's a legal victory for Bank of America (BAC +0.1%) as a federal judge dismisses an investor lawsuit accusing it of concealing a $10B fraud case brought by AIG. The bank was not required to disclose the imminence of the suit because the news wasn't materially different than previously-disclosed information, says the judge, the bank made no inaccurate or incomplete statements, and there was no duty to disclose the information sought.Of course, BofA's 20% dive on the day in 2011 when AIG sued it over $28B in MBS suggests something materially different occurred.Whether the $8.5B settlement on that case goes through is at this moment before a judge (the Article 77 hearing is expected to restart next week).

Banks brace for continued legal issues over mortgages
The legal headaches for the big banks over mortgages only grow after JPMorgan's (JPM -0.1%) $5,1B settlement with the FHFA - 12% of the original purchase amount. "My sense is, the industry is concerned about what’s happened,” says law professor Carl Tobias. “The size of the JPM settlement made people wake up and be more concerned than they were before.”Fourteen banks still have similar suits pending with the FHFA, but most-exposed is Bank of America (BAC +0.5%). ISI's Glenn Schorr extrapolates the JPMorgan settlement and figures BofA will have to pay $6.8B, well beyond $5.1B in legal reserves (BofA disclosed last week that losses could go beyond this). Goldman (GS +0.1%) and Morgan Stanley (MS +0.3%) would be on the hook for $1.3B each, says Schorr, and Morgan analyst Betsey Graseck cut her estimates for both BofA and Goldman last week.FHFA holds plenty of sway to get that 12% payout, but private investors have typically only gotten back 2% - looking at the government's fat payout might encourage them to lobby for a boost.Then there's a new tool for prosecutors - a law called the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, or Firrea - "another arrow in the quiver of prosecutors, and it’s worked," says Tobias. It was central to a loss for BofA last month in a lawsuit over mortgages sold to the GSEs. Among its twists is a 10-year statute of limitations, and BofA discloses the DOJ is employing Firrea in a new suit about a certain 2008 mortgage offering. Nov. 4, 2013, 10:56 AM | 6 Comments
Pressure rises on holdout banks as Wells settles with FHFA
The price tag - obscured by a confidentiality agreement - is believed to less than $1B, reports the FT (a far cry from JPM's $5.1B settlement). Wells (WFC -0.4%) was the only large U.S. bank to not be named when the FHFA filed suit against 17 lenders in 2011 - apparently because it had already entered into settlement discussions with the GSE regulator.In addition to the Bank of Dimon's settlement last week, Ally Financial reports it expects to soon reach a deal, and HSBC boosted reserves - a sign a settlement is nearing.This ramps up the pressure on holdouts like Bank of America (BAC -0.9%), RBS, Deutsche Bank (DB -0.7%), and Credit Suisse (CS -0.4%) - all of which have large exposure to FHFA cases - to cut their own deals. Extrapolating the JPMorgan settlement leads to a range of payments of $1.7B to $7B for these four lenders, says the FT, which has reported the FHFA is pressing BofA for more than $6B.

Morgan and BofA call truce on broker poaching
Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO James Gorman signaled less advisor switching and thus lower costs on his company's earnings call last week (compensation fell to 57% of wealth management revenue in Q3 vs. 63% a year earlier) and Bank of America (BAC) is ending the practice of retention bonuses to top Merrill Lynch performers. Bonuses handed out to brokers amid the financial crisis were a "tax on the industry," says Gorman.For its part, Merrill lost the fewest number of advisors to competitors in Q3 since the end of 2010. BofA doesn't disclose the compensation ratio for the thundering herd, but said its wealth management margin was a robust 25.6% in Q3 (it hit 27.6% in Q2, the highest since 2007).A recent regulatory rule backed by Morgan and Merrill may also help: Finra voted to make defecting brokers disclose how much their new employer paid them to leave. Stifel Financial (SF) - with more than 2K brokers - calls the action anti-competitive. Oct. 24, 2013, 3:35 PM | 1 Comment

Countrywide found guilty in U.S. mortgage suit
A federal jury has found Bank of America's (BAC -2.1%) Countrywide unit liable for defrauding Fannie Mae (FNMA +22%) and Freddie Mac (FMCC +19.4%) by selling them thousands of defective mortgages.The judge will determine the amount of the penalty - the U.S. has requested $848M, the gross loss to the GSEs as calculated by its expert witness.The suit centered on Countrywide's HSSL - High Speed Swim Lane - program instituted in August 2007, says the government, to keep the music playing as the property market was falling apart.

BofA seeks to improve share of European leveraged finance business
Bank of America (BAC) has a market-leading position in U.S. leveraged finance, but not so in Europe, and senior bankers say the bank is set to commit more capital and staff to change that. It's the only lender to have had a hand in the three largest European M&A deals this year - Virgin Media, DE Masters Blenders, and Ista - and the bank has risen from 13th in the ranking to 4th so far in 2013.Barclays (BCS) last week indicated its ambition to move up from its current 11th place in the rankings.

Convinced on cost savings, Evercore boosts BofA estimates
Seeing credit costs remaining lower for longer and more confidence about expense savings falling to the bottom line, analyst Andrew Marquardt lifts his EPS estimates and price target on Buy-rated Bank of America (BAC) following yesterday's earnings.2013 EPS is lifted to $1 from $0.91, 2014 to $1.36 from $1.30, 2015 to $1.63 from $1.52. The price target is raised to $17 from $16.Pressed on cost savings by Mike Mayo during the CC yesterday (transcript), CFO Bruce Thompson confirmed the bank has already achieved about $1.4B of $2B of quarterly expense cuts promised by management (by mid-2015). Thompson also confirmed his expectation for this number to directly boost the bottom line. Oct. 17, 2013, 8:37 AM | 2 Comments
BofA management: Improving credit trends about to flatten out
Bank of America (BAC) repurchased 60M shares in Q3, bringing repurchases YTD to 140M shares, or $1.9B (vs. the $5B authorized by the Fed through 2014 Q1), says CEO Moynihan on the earnings call now playing live on Seeking Alpha (presentation slides).Net interest income excluding market-related impacts hasn't really budged from about $10.5B during any quarter over the last year. The bank continues to be "asset sensitive" and thus poised for NII to move higher along with interest rates. Excluding market-related impact, net interest yield rose to 2.44% from 2.36% last quarter.While expenses fell $1.1B from last year, they ticked $400M higher in Q2 as the bank - glancing at neighbor JPMorgan - boosted litigation reserves by $500M. Full-time-equivalent employees fell to 247.9K from 272.6K.The tailwind from improving credit is about the stop: Net charge-offs - which fell to $1.7B in Q3 from $2.1B in Q2 and $4.1B a year ago - are expected to fall again in Q4 before stabilizing in 2014 to a run rate of about $1.5B per quarter, says CFO Bruce Thompson.As expected, FICC revenue fell a sharp 20%, or $501M to $2B in Q3, but market share gains and improved volume had equity revenue 36% higher, or $255M to $1B.Higher earlier, shares are now flat premarket.Q&A session is set to begin shortly.

Provision for credit losses drops to $296M from $1.8B a year ago.Net interest margin of 2.44% is up 12 basis points from last year's Q3.Noninterest expense of $16.4B is down from $17.5B a year ago - a comination of lower litigation expense, continued cutbacks on Legacy Assets and Servicing (LAS), and the bank's general continued trimming of expenses (i.e. headcount).Mortgage slowdown: Consumer real estate services revenue of $1.6B compares to $2.1B in Q2, $3.1B a year ago.Other consumer highlights: Mobile banking customers up 26% to 14M (lower costs moving forward), consumer credit card loss rate of 3.47% is lowest since Q1 2006.Thundering herd update: Wealth management revenue of $4.4B up from $4.1B a year ago, with pre-tax margin of 25.5% up from 22.2%.The trading slowdown hits BofA as well, with FICC revenue of $2B off 20% from a year ago.Conference call live on Seeking Alpha at 8:30 ET.BAC +1.9% premarket.

BofA estimates cut at Evercore
Evercore's Andrew Marquardt gets on board the rush to cut bank estimates ahead of Q3 earnings reports this month, tweaking down expected Bank of America (BAC) core EPS to $0.23, still ahead of Street consensus $0.20, but below $0.25 in Q2. On a reported basis, Marquardt expects a $0.15 print.The reasons aren't news - slow mortgage and capital markets activity, though expense reductions should offset somewhat.Full year core EPS estimate is now $0.91 from $0.96. 2014 is $1.30 from $1.31. 2015 is unchanged at $1.52.He maintains his Buy rating and $16 price target.Shares +0.3% to $14.04 premarket.

Moody's: BofA executes at cutting delinquent loan portfolio
The use of sub-servicing arrangements and outright sales of mortgage servicing rights have helped Bank of America (BAC +1%) cut its loan servicing portfolio by nearly 50% since 2010, according to Moody's.The moves mean a significantly smaller delinquent loan portfolio as BofA specifically targeted millions of its loans as high-risk, and chose those for sale or sub-servicing. They also mean major expense cuts thanks to less staff, fewer vendors, and fewer offices.It also has meant riches for the buyers of these MSRs such as Ocwen (OCN), Nationstar (NSM), and Walter Investment Management (WAC)."Bank of America has executed on its strategy thus far, and if it continues its efforts, will no longer be a major servicer of delinquent loans," says Moody's Gene Berman.

Earnings at top five banks seen taking major hit
Analysts have cut their earnings estimates for the top five U.S. banks by over $1B in total, due to increasing fears about a sharp fall in trading revenue - especially from fixed-income operations - and higher legal costs.JPMorgan (JPM) has been particularly affected, with consensus for net income down $526M to below $5B. The company's legal woes are seen adding $2B to expenses.Analysts have lowered their net income for Bank of America (BAC) by $128M, for Goldman Sachs (GS) by $123M, for Morgan Stanley (MS) by $97M, and for Citigroup (C) by $210M.

No sugarcoating it: Mayo likes Morgan Stanley
'Morgan Stanley, Morgan Stanley, and Morgan Stanley" are Mike Mayo's top 3 picks among the banks. MS is double over the last year and it's a double again over the next three, he says.Of the dip in trading revenue report from Citi which hit the banks yesterday, Mayo says it's old news - fixed income trading has been going down for years and a continued fall is already in Mayo's models. Any revisions lower are little more than "noise," and will be a blip on the screen a few months from now. Morgan Stanley gets just 15% of revenue from fixed-income trading - sluggishness in this area is no excuse not to own the stock, says Mayo."Revenues stink in the banking industry," he allows, and that's why he likes Morgan Stanley (and Citigroup C as well) - "the restructuring story can cut through the revenue weakness."What about Bank of America (BAC) which has moved nearly tick for tick with Morgan Stanley this year? Morgan has more levers, says Mayo, particularly in Wealth Management after its purchase of Smith Barney from Citigroup.

Citigroup's warning on trading revenue hits Goldman
Citigroup (C) slips 1% in the premarket after its weekend "pre-announcement" of a big fall in FICC revenue in Q3. The bank had been hoping to get bailed out by a big September, but the Fed's non-taper last week squelched the chance of major portfolio moves by clients.Anybody paying attention surely noticed last week's evaporation of profit at Jefferies (now owned by Leucadia) as fixed-income trading revenue essentially disappeared.Deutshce Bank (DB) is expected to soon be out with a warning similar to Citibank's. Barclays (BCS) and Credit Suisse (CS) have already waved their own red flags over this issue.Not yet heard from are Goldman (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), JPMorgan (JPM), and BofA (BAC), but Goldman is also off nearly 1% premarket.

More details on SocGen's initiation of coverage on big banks
Bank of America's (BAC -0.6%) operating earnings could hit $1.72 per share in 2015 from $1.01 this year, says analyst Murali Gopal, initiating the stock with a Buy (initially reported yesterday). Cost savings, reserve releases, and a strong capital markets business leave the bank "uniquely placed" for sustained outperformance.Also started at Buy is Citigroup (C -0.6%) as rising home prices could boost Citi Holdings - the unit into which the bank's legacy assets have been placed. Better earnings should also allow the recapture of Citi's $45B deferred tax asset. He sees 2015 adjusted EPS of $6.31 vs. $4.93 this year.JPMorgan (JPM +0.7%) is started at Hold because of the regulatory target on its back, with 2015 EPS expected to rise to just $6.25 in 2015 from $5.88 this year.Wells Fargo (WFC -0.6%) also rates just a hold because of the bank's heavy exposure to the slowing mortgage market.

Buffett: No plans on selling BofA warrants
"Basically we love the position of being an owner," says Buffett of the 10-year warrants Berkshire (BRK.A, BRK.B) received when it purchased a $5B preferred stake in Bank of America (BAC) in 2011. The warrants are struck at $7.14 each and allow the purchase of 700M shares of BofA common up to the year 2021 (last night's close was $14.61; bravo, Mr. Buffett).Buffett expects to hold the warrants until near-expiration and then convert them to common stock, though that calculation could change were the bank to institute a significant dividend.On redeeming Buffett's preferred stake, BofA CEO Moynihan says the bank has more expensive capital to retire first.

Bank of America's (BAC +0.2%) Merrill Lynch unit will have to face a lawsuit by two trusts over more than $1B of MBS, rules a judge. Merrill in 2006 purchased over 6K mortgages with principal balance of more than $1B from a 3rd party loan originator and turned them into securities which it then sold.The originator - ResMAE mortgage - filed for bankruptcy in 2007, and the trusts say Merrill is obligated to buy back loans in which reps and warranties were breached.

Credit Suisse ratchets down bank earnings estimates
Following dour management commentary about the mortgage banking slowdown at investor conferences this week, Credit Suisse cuts 2013 EPS estimates at BAC, C, PNC. For Wells Fargo (WFC), estimates for 2014 and 2015 are revised lower by 1% due to worse-than-expected guidance for gain-on-sale margins. JPMorgan (JPM) and U.S. Bancorp (USB) see no cut in the out years as weaker revenue should be offset by better credit performance.Indeed, after hearing management commentary, Credit Suisse is forecasting loan-loss reserve declines at every bank in its coverage universe for Q3.JPMorgan's presentation is a good indication of what the banks are facing with regards to mortgages. Wells Fargo's too.Bank ETFs: KBE, KBWB, KRE. Sep. 13, 2013, 12:46 PM
Explosive action in BofA Article 77 hearing
Bank of America's (BAC +0.3%) Article 77 hearing resumed this week at which a NY State Supreme Court judge will or won't approve the bank's $8.5B MBS settlement with investors like Goldman, BlackRock, and Pimco. To review: The objectors - led by AIG - contend the amount is far too small and the trustee assigned to guard bondholder interests - BNY Mellon (BK) - was horribly conflicted due to business ties with BofA.In what CLSA Mike Mayo describes as the most explosive action thus far, AIG's attorneys tried to establish Brian Lin of little-known RRMS Advisors (he was hired by BK to write a report on the reasonableness of the $8.5B deal) was no more than a rubber-stamp for the cheap settlement. The judge eventually had to step in and cut off questioning.Mayo maintains his sell rating on BAC, believing Street consensus of a 1-in-20 chance of the settlement being throw out is too small. Should the judge actually vacate the settlement, the bank faces another $16B-$22B in legal damages, he says. Sep. 13, 2013, 11:18 AM | 29 Comments

As expected, Verizon bond offering a raging success
Verizon Communications (VZ) received orders for $100B of new bonds from over 1,000 investors as it sold $49B worth of debt in the largest corporate-bond offering in U.S. history.Everyone seems to have emerged happy from this deal. Verizon received a huge chunk of the money it needs - and at relatively low rates - to pay for the $130B acquisition of Vodafone's 45% stake in Verizon Wireless; the banks involved made $265M in fees, with Barclays (BCS), JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) each earning about $41M; and investors received a higher-yielding debt from a strong U.S. company.

BofA co-head of FICC trading exiting
Gerhard Seebacher - co-head of global fixed income, currency, and commodities trading - is exiting after 18 years at the bank, reports Bloomberg. He had run the business along with David Sobotka, who will remain as sole chief of the unit, say sources.Seebacher had been co-head of FICC trading since November 2011. Regulatory and new capital rules, not to mention sluggish trading, have crimped FICC revenues at the global banks.Earlier today, Bank of America (BAC +0.2%) presented at the Barclays financial services conference.

Bank of America mobile use growing fast
Polled as to what would make them bullish on Bank of America (BAC +0.2%), 45% of fence-sitting analysts at the Barclays conference say more visibility on litigation costs. Given the FHFA and AIG cases still winding through courts, it's something CFO Bruce Thompson is unable to deliver during the Q&A following his presentation.Another point of major interest  for expense watchers is mobile, and the bank has seen mobile users grow to 13.2M from 7.7M two years ago - branches have declined to 5,328 from 5,742. The cost to process a mobile deposit is 13.6x lower than through a branch.In Q2, 4% of all checks were deposited utilizing Mobile Check Deposits - the service was started mid-quarter. Since the end of Q2, self-service transactions have grown 4% while teller transactions have declined 12%.Presentation slides. Sep. 11, 2013, 12:23 PM | 1 Comment
Bank of America presents at Barclays
"Our balance sheet remains asset sensitive," says Bank of America (BAC -0.1%) CFO Bruce Thompson, presenting (webcast) (presentation slides) at the Barclays conference. Like other bank managements, Thompson is making the case for higher profits as interest rates rise. According to the bank's models, a 100 bp steepening of the yield curve would add $1B to net interest income over the next year (NII was $10.4B in Q2). A 100 bp parallel rise in rates would add $3.3B.The bank is ahead of plan (previously tipped) on reducing legacy mortgage servicing costs, expecting LAS expense excluding litigation to fall below $2B by Q4, below $1B in 2014Q1. The target is a $500M run rate by mid-2015. Sep. 11, 2013, 11:32 AM | 1 Comment

Change coming to DJIA weighting?
Notably not included in this morning's new additions to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were Apple and Google. "We had to think about it, but the arithmetic doesn't work," S&P's David Blitzer tells CNBC. Blitzer hints of a possible change coming to the Dow weighting scheme.The DJIA is currently price-weighted, meaning the share price is more important to a company's weight in the index rather than market cap. A back-of-the-envelope calculation finds Apple would be about 30% of the Dow were it added!Indeed an S&P Dow Jones statement says the low share price of Alcoa (AA), Bank of America (BAC), and H-P (HPQ) was a key reason for their removal.The real-money impact on those removed and added (GS, NKE, V) won't be huge as a relatively small amount of money is indexed to the DJIA.

TD Ameritrade index shows clients buying August's dip
The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index increased 5.95% to 5.16 in August as markets stumbled, meaning clients continued their pattern of selling the rips and buying the dips - the index previously fell in July as stocks rallied.There was no contrarian action in Tesla (TSLA), where clients continued to buy as it gained for the month. Dip-buying was notable, however, in a number of basic material companies, including BP, Kinder Morgan (KMP), and Potash (POT).Clients were net sellers in financial names like Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS), and they faded rallies in Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB). Other popular names sold included Chesapeake Energy (CHK), Merck (MRK), and Qualcomm (QCOM). Sep. 9, 2013, 9:28 PM | 5 Comments
BofA to close more mortgage offices, cut more jobs
The bank is set to close 16 mortgage offices and slash 2.1K jobs as refinancing hits a wall, reports Bloomberg. (Earlier: JPMorgan says refis are off 60% from May, and Wells Fargo said to expect continuing declines in Q3).In late August, BAC shuttered another office and cut 1K jobs thanks not just to slowing refis, but improving credit trends meaning less manpower needed to service delinquent loans. Servicing costs are falling off a cliff. Sep. 9, 2013, 3:46 PM | 6 Comments
Citigroup and JPMorgan best-positioned to move forward
Ahead of industry conferences later this month, Credit Suisse offers a preview: The revenue environment remains challenging thanks to low rates and slow loan growth. Mortgage banking activity held up in Q2, but managements are cautious now, and will be touting expense cuts in their mortgage units - meaningful improvement in expenses wasn't notable in Q2 (with the exception of BAC), so look for comments about traction in this area.The banks best positioned to grow revenue, manage expenses, and deploy capital in this sluggish environment are Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan (JPM), says the team.

Berkowitz talks strategy as Fairholme reopens to investors
The government is an "unbelievable hedge fund," says Bruce Berkowitz (on CNBC), regarding what is turning out to be the state's quite profitable stakes in Fannie Mae (FNMA.OB) and Freddie Mac (FMCC.OB).Turning to two of his other big investments, Berkowitz says Bank of America (BAC +0.7%) is going to look like Wells Fargo in a few years and CEO Moynihan is a genius. A bank analyst in the early 90s, Berkowitz made his bones touting the value in Wells Fargo when most thought it was going to collapse under the weight of the California housing bust. On AIG, Berkowitz says book value is currently about $60 per share (price now is $48).Of his penchant for having a small, concentrated portfolio: "I don't understand this argument about diversification upon diversification. It's just going to lead to an average performance ... the price you're going to pay for above average performance is short-term volatility." Sep. 4, 2013, 11:04 AM | 2 Comments
Bank of America agrees to sale of remaining CCB stake
Bank of America (BAC) agrees to sell its remaining stake in China Construction Bank - about 2B shares or 1% of the company.

Analyst: Worst case MBS scenario for banks is manageable
Worst-case estimates of legal losses stemming from pre-crisis mortgage sales at the three largest U.S. banks "are clearly manageable," says Drexel Hamilton's David Hilder. His conclusion comes after studying "reasonably possible losses" in the Q2 filings of BAC, C, JPM, and WFC."Initial estimates of mortgage-related losses and litigation settlement costs were too low ... at this point, more than 5 years since the mortgage-driven parts of the crisis began to explode ... we believe the banks' estimates ... are likely to be more accurate than externally-derived estimates."Hilder's view is the consensus one, but (surprise) CLSA's Mike Mayo says Bank of American faces billions more in potential losses owing to the challenge to its $8.5B settlement to resolve $107B in investor losses. The Article 77 hearing over that matter resumes on September 9 following a summer recess. Sep. 3, 2013, 2:10 PM
End of an era as BofA to exit rest of CCB stake
It's the end of an era as Bank of America (BAC +1.7%) putting the remainder of its holdings in China Construction Bank on the block has it the last of the big global banks to exit its stake in a major Chinese bank. Goldman in May sold the last of its piece of ICBC in a $1.1B deal.These stakes were purchased in the last decade just ahead of the Chinese banks going public, and the U.S. banks - in capital-raising mode - have been disposing of them ever since the financial crisis. "Because of Basel III, the era that global banks can buy small stakes in businesses here and there is gone," says Mizuho's James Antos.The global banks generally made good money on their purchases, but another goal of the investments - access in China - failed to materialize as hoped.Global X China Financials ETF (CHIX +3.2%).

Verizon looks to raise $61B bridge loan to help fund $130B deal
Verizon Communications (VZ) has reportedly started syndicating a $61B one-year bridge loan that will support the company's $130B acquisition of 45% of Verizon Wireless from Vodafone.Verizon intends to help pay for the deal with $49B in bonds and $14B in other debt, but might need the bridge loan if it can't issue the bonds by the time the transaction closes, which is expected in Q1 2014. The $63B in funding will replace the bridge loan.JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America (BAC) and Barclays (BCS) are leading the financing and underwriting the deal.Meanwhile, Verizon has no plans to enter the Canadian market. The carrier had been linked with a couple of struggling wireless start-ups. The news should be positive for Canada's three largest telecom operators - BCE (BCE), Rogers Communications (RCI) and Telus (TU) - whose shares tumbled in response to Verizon's expansion plans in Canada and then climbed on initial reports of the Vodafone deal.

Mortgage slowdown to cost 1K Bank of America workers their jobs
The move in BofA's (BAC -0.3%) Beachwood, Ohio office comes as the mortgage refinance boom goes into reverse, and as the bank continues with its focus on cutting costs (aiming at 30K job cuts total, $8B in savings annually by 2015).Refinances nationwide made up 70-75% of home loans last year and have dropped to 60-65% this year, according to Freddie Mac. They're expected to fall to less than 50% next year.Most of those being fired worked in mortgage refinancing, while the rest are in customer service for consumer banking.Bank of America employs around 170K.

Zero down mortgages preserved in new rule
Maybe a victory for prospective homeowners, but certainly a victory for anyone dependent upon a speedy housing market, the new proposal for the Qualified Residential Mortgage rule (QRM) is quite a bit less-restrictive than the original version.The new standard would allow a no downpayment option similar to that allowed by the CFPB - that rule protects banks from being sued by mortgage investors on zero-down loans as long as the borrower's debt to income ratio is less than 43%.The new plan also requires banks to hold onto a slice of mortgages (for those with less than 20% down) when debt/income is above 43% as opposed to 36% in the initial proposal.The agencies will await public comment before a vote on the final rule.Homebuilders, mortgage bankers, and realtors look on with interest.Related: WFC, BAC, C, JPM, XHB, ITB, RLGY.

Legal costs for major U.S. banks top $100B
The U.S.'s six largest banks have accumulated legal costs of $103B so far since the financial crisis, Bloomberg calculates, noting that the figure is greater than the amount they've paid in dividends in the past five years.Legal fees and litigation costs account for $56B and the rest is for payments to mortgage investors.JPMorgan's (JPM) legal bill is $21.3B while it has allocated $8.1B for mortgage buybacks. Bank of America's (BAC) legal expenses are $19.1B and its repurchase provisions $28.6B. The other banks are Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS).

BofA to pay $160M in racial discrimination case
Bank of America (BAC) has agreed to pay $160M to settle a lawsuit brought by black financial advisers, who accused the bank of not giving them the same opportunities as white staff in investment teams and account distribution.The first lawsuit was filed in 2005 on behalf of Nashville-based George McReynolds, who still works for the bank, and grew into one that encompassed the claims of hundreds of others.

FHFA wants $6B from JPMorgan to settle MBS claims
UBS last month agreed to a precedent-setting $885M settlement, or more than 90% of expected losses on MBS it packaged. The notional value of paper sold by JPMorgan (JPM) is 5x larger than that of UBS, leading to a figure close to the $6B range. JPMorgan - negotiating for a lower amount - says claims against other banks allege fraud, making their offenses more serious.$6B would be the high-end of what JPMorgan last year figured was its liability in the case (the suit is over $33B in MBS). The House of Dimon could await its day in court, but nearly all initial rulings have gone against the banks thus far. A settlement before the summer 2014 trial date still looks probable.Watching closely will be Bank of America (BAC) and RBS, both of which have heavy exposure to the FHFA suits and have yet to settle. Morgan Stanley estimates a worst-case scenario of $3.6B for BofA vs. a base case of $2B. Aug. 27, 2013, 2:55 PM | 7 Comments
BofA's legacy servicing costs are dropping fast
Wow. Bank of America's (BAC +0.4%) Legacy Asset Servicing costs are expected to drop to a normalized run rate of $500M per quarter by the end of 2015, says KBW's Chris Mutascio after a meeting with the bank's CFO Bruce Thompson. This compares to $2.3B in Q2 of this year. Annually, this is $7.2B in savings over the next 2 years and beyond (mostly by way of layoffs as the beefed-up staff hired to deal with non-performing mortgages is cut).For this year, management now expects LAS costs to fall to $2B in Q4. This is below the $2.1B guidance given during the Q2 earnings call (transcript).Mutascio doesn't have an EPS estimate beyond 2014 ($1.38), but the LAS savings represent a $0.17-$0.25 benefit, he says. He currently rates the shares a Hold with $15 price target. Aug. 26, 2013, 10:27 AM

BofA estimates lifted at Credit Suisse
Though maintaining their Hold rating on the stock, Credit Suisse's Orenbuch and Glaser lift their price target on BAC by $1 to $14 as they expect cost savings are set to come in faster than expectations.The bank has made good on about 55% of the savings hoped for with its New BAC program, but the mortgage business should offer additional leverage for cuts.While the savings are enough for the team to lift its 2013-2015 EPS estimates and current price target, it will take meaningful revenue growth before they can get more positive on the stock (unfortunately markets anticipate - it will probably be at $18 by the time BofA rates a Buy).2013 EPS is now estimated at $1.05 vs. $0.99 previously, 2014 at $1.40 vs. $1.30, 2015 at $1.55 vs. $1.45.

Backlash over bank profits in Brazil muni market
Brazil's nascent municipal bond market is brought to a standstill as the government is unhappy with big profits collected by Credit Suisse (CS) and Bank of America (BAC) for underwriting deals.Credit Suisse loaned $1.27B to the state of Minas Gerais in February and then sold the debt to investors at a 9.2% markup. Bank of America made 3.6% by selling off a $662M loan to Maranahao last month.The government wants a piece of that action and is considering banning the securitization of new loans and a cap on interest rates."These states paid a premium for their lack of experience in international markets,” says a bank fixed income trader. “Investment banks can justify that premium because they’re forming a secondary market for these where none existed before.” Aug. 21, 2013, 12:28 PM | 1 Comment

Nygren: Buyback stocks cheaper than dividend payers
Investors have been overpaying for dividend stocks while undervaluing those firms buying back shares, Oakmark's Bill Nygren tells the crew at Fast Money.

Banks' hiring of well-connected relatives in China widespread
While the SEC is only now investigating JPMorgan (JPM) for possibly hiring the children of influential officials in China to win business, the recruitment by major banks of well-connected relatives has been going on for over a decade.Goldman Sachs (GS) once employed the grandson of former Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Credit Suisse (CS) the daughter of ex-Prime Minister Wen Jiabao. In 2006, the son-in-law of of a politburo member helped Merrill Lynch (BAC) win a deal to work on the $22B IPO of state-owned bank ICBC.While some of the recruits work hard, others barely make it to the office. Still, regulators might find it difficult to prove a direct connection between an appointment and the obtaining of a contract. Aug. 21, 2013, 3:44 AM | 9 Comments

Morgan Stanley duo speculates on BofA/FHFA settlement amount
UBS' $885M MBS settlement with the FHFA may have been good news for that bank, but maybe not so much for Bank of America (BAC), opine Morgan Stanley's Betsy Grasek and Michael Cyprus.UBS settled for total estimated lifetime losses on the securities, a figure if extrapolated to Bank of America would lead to a $10B settlement, but that's not going to happen, they say. A previous court ruling has already rejected the idea BofA is fully responsible for Countrywide claims and the $10B estimate is likely too high given the rally in some of these securitizations over the last 2 years.They figure the worst case scenario at about $3.6B vs. a base case (presumably baked into the stock at this point) of $2B.Grasek and Cyprus remain positive on BAC given a valuation of just 0.59x 2015 estimated book value.

Blackstone hires banks for Hilton IPO
Blackstone (BX) has reportedly hired a number of banks to lead an IPO of Hilton Worldwide, which the private-equity firm took private in 2007 in a $26.7B leveraged buyout, one of the largest before the financial crisis. The deal included $7B in assumed debt.The flotation is expected to take place in H1 next year.The banks involved - which are so far Deutsche Bank (DB), Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) - are expected to help Hilton refinance $13B in debt.The speculation comes as a rebound in demand for hotel rooms and not enough supply has led to a boom in the hotel sector.Hilton's pro forma EBITDA rose 17% in H1; 2013 EBITDA is forecast to be 58% higher than in 2009.The speculation also follows reports yesterday that Blackstone is looking to exit La Quinta Inns & Suites, a budget hotel chain.

Combined with a jump in currency volatility this year, it's unleashed an intense fight for market share.Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS) - smaller players in FX - have stepped up their efforts to take business from traditional giants Deutsche Bank (DB), Barclays (BCS), and JPMorgan (JPM), according to those in the know. Smaller firms like BTIG, Newedge, FXCM, and Gain Capital (GCAP) have further fragmented the market.The lack of regulatory zeal means banks can fund currency trading with less capital than other lines of business. FX contributed just 8% of FICC revenue in 2012, down from 36% 4 years earlier.Average daily trading volume of currencies was $5.6T in June, up from $4.9T in May.

DOJ: BofA trading staff tried to warn about toxic mortgages
"None of these loans are suitable for a prime jumbo A-credit securitization," wrote one Bank of America (BAC) trader in 2007, according to the DOJ's lawsuit over $850M in MBS. "Like a fat kid in dodgeball, these need to stay on the sidelines," wrote another.The bank portrayed these as prime loans vetted by underwriting when, in fact, they were wholesale mortgages - originated by outside brokers - according to Justice.As of June, at least 23% of the mortgages in the pool had defaulted or were delinquent, leading to $70M in losses thus far, with maybe another $50M to come, estimates Fitch.The bank responds: "These were prime mortgages sold to sophisticated investors ... The loans in this pool performed better than loans with similar characteristics originated and secured at the same time by other financial institutions."Shares -1% premarket.

More on BofA being sued by the U.S.
Bank of America (BAC -1.1%) defrauded investors by packaging and selling prime jumbo loans whose poor underwriting made them just as risky as subprime loans, according to the DOJ filing.The loans were made in 2007 and packaged and sold as $850M in MBS in 2008. Investors have already lost $70M with another $50M in losses expected, says the DOJ.The suit is not terribly unexpected as the bank last week disclosed the DOJ was probing a couple of jumbo mortgage securitization deals.The case is the first federal suit brought by the President's RMBS Working Group. It's a civil suit, and only the bank has been named. The stock is off a few more pennies than it was 30 minutes ago.Previous. Aug. 6, 2013, 3:44 PM | 6 Comments

HSBC faces $1.6B payout over mortgage bonds
HSBC (HBC) faces having to pay $1.6B in a lawsuit from the Federal Housing Finance Agency over soured mortgage bonds that the bank sold to Fannie Mae (FNMA.OB) and Freddie Mac (FMCC.OB). The bank made the disclosure yesterday.The figure is well above the $900M that analysts at Credit Suisse had estimated.In total the FHFA has sued 18 banks over mortgage bonds; should HSBC's calculations for its liabilities be applied to some of the defendants with the largest exposure, including Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan (JPM) and RBS (RBS), they would have to pay over $7B each. Should these banks make payments in proportion with a recent UBS deal, the bill would above $4B. Aug. 6, 2013, 3:23 AM | 11 Comments

Stakes are high given BofA has reserved just $8.5B for potential payouts, but objectors - including AIG, Triaxx, and 3 FHLB banks - will point to recoveries received by MBIA and Ambac north of $0.60 on the dollar. With losses at $108B - well, you do the math. Yes, the bar for the objectors to overcome is a high one, but - thanks to a series of recent rulings - not as high as a year ago.

A New York court is due to start a hearing today over whether it should approve Bank of America (BAC) $8.5B agreement to settle claims with investors over soured mortgage bonds. While heavyweights such as BlackRock (BLK) and Goldman Sachs (GS) support the deal, it faces opposition from AIG (AIG), which says it has $10.5B worth of claims against BofA. Approval of the agreement would enable the bank to take a major step in cleaning up the mess it inherited when it bought Countrywide.

Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan has vowed to finally make cross-selling work, but he faces resistance from the thundering herd at Merrill Lynch. One example is a new bonus formula which puts the bank's interests at odds with those of Merrill clients. Brokers are also wary of steering customers to the bank for a mortgage only to be hit by rejections or lousy customer service. "We're going to hand (the client) over to this mortgage process and then 3 months later they hate you," says a (former) wealth manager. By the way, BAC touched a 2+ year high today.

AIG drops its lawsuit against the FRBNY over who may sue over losses suffered by the company on MBS. The Fed's Maiden Lane II took over the securities as part of the bailout, and the issue was whether AIG gave up its right to sue when it unloaded the paper. The move comes even as a judge earlier this month said AIG did not relinquish its right to sue Bank of America (BAC) over mortgages issued by Countrywide. May 30, 2013, 4:29 PM | 3 Comments
Fiat (FIATY.PK) is reportedly in negotiations with major banks to borrow up to $10B that the Italian carmaker would use to acquire the 41.5% of Chrysler it doesn't own and refinance the two companies' debt at lower interest rates. The banks include Bank of America (BAC), Deutsche Bank (DB), Goldman Sachs (GS) (GS) and BNP Paribas (BNOBF.PK). Fiat's purchase of the holding is being held up by a legal dispute over the value of the stake. May 30, 2013, 3:06 AM | 3 Comments
There will be no negative equity in the U.S. housing market within 18-24 months, predicts Ed Yardeni, extrapolating today's news - Case-Shiller up 10.9%, Bill Ackman and Ken Griffin buying up fancy properties, the return of CA's flippers, bidding wars in NYC - into the future. If he's right, it could explain the resilience of Citigroup (C +1.1%) (still with heavy exposure to maybe not-so-toxic assets through Citi Holdings), and Bank of America (BAC +1%) amid today's big decline.

Bank of America (BAC) fights back against NY's crusading AG, telling Eric Schneiderman he has no right to sue over violations to the $25B mortgage settlement without giving the bank time to cure said violations (which the bank denies making).

More on the BofA/MBIA settlement: As the settlement occurred prior to the filing of BofA's (BAC) 10-Q, the bank will take a Q1 charge of $1.5B, or $0.10/share, bringing net income down from $0.20/share to $0.10. The Tier 1 Capital Ratio will increase 10 bps to 9.52%, reflecting the reduction in risk-weighted assets associated with terminated CDS contracts. Tangible book value drops $0.10/share to $13.36. In addition to cash of about $1.7B, BofA will provide a $500M credit line to MBIA Insurance. It will also receive warrants to purchase 9.94M shares of MBIA (MBI) stock - roughly a 4.9% stake - at an exercise price of $9.59/share anytime prior to May 2018. (PR)

It's a win-win as MBIA Insurance gets a lifeline and BofA removes the potential of a far larger award at trial.

A Dallas Fed plan to cap assets at FDIC-insured banks at $250B would force most of the TBTFs to more than halve their consumer and business-lending units. Such a limit, says Dallas Fed EVP Rosenblum, is required to allow the FDIC to shut them down without using taxpayer funds. The Dallas proposal isn't becoming law anytime soon, but it is driving the debate in D.C.

"They can't get rid of this rule fast enough," says a bank analyst of the FASB's progress toward eliminating the debt valuation adjustment (DVA) from bank earnings. The rule - which perversely adds to earnings as a bank's credit deteriorates (and subtracts from the bottom line as credit improves) - has been behind big whipsaws in reported numbers in recent quarters (Q3 will be no exception). "(It's) one of the more ridiculous concepts that's ever been invented in accounting," says Jamie Dimon.

Legal settlements often ease investors’ minds, but the size of BofA's (BAC -1.5%) $2.34B tab for settling claims it misled investors about Merrill Lynch’s financial health before its purchase was an unwelcome surprise. Some analysts worry BofA’s legal exposure doesn’t seem to be tapering off; it's the bank's 11th settlement totaling $29B since the start of the financial crisis.

More on the BofA (BAC -0.9%) settlement: The $2.43B payment will be covered by existing litigation reserves and Q3 litigation expenses of $1.6B.

All told, the expected hit to Q3 EPS is $0.28/share (the bank earned $0.19 in Q2). Previous (I, II).

Wall Street firms will likely reduce bonuses rather than cut jobs to control expenses this year, says Morgan Stanley's Betsy Graseck. Compensation will probably drop from a year ago as banks attempt to avoid further headcount reductions after culling their ranks heavily last year, with most of the cuts coming from employee bonuses rather than base salaries. And bonuses, as we all know, represent a disproportionately large percentage of the income for Wall Street professionals.

Barclays' settlement over Libor-fixing claims gives immediate credibility to lawsuits worldwide against banks for buying financial instruments based on a manipulated rate.

While Moody's downgrades could lead to increased borrowing rates for the affected banks, the action isn't expected to have a big impact on consumers in the short term.

Bank of America's (BAC) stunning retreat in backing off its planned debit card fee may be a victory for consumers, but as sure as the sun rises in the morning, banks will search for other ways to make up the reduction in interchange fees merchants pay for debit card purchases. “When banks have their revenue streams cut in one area, they will find a way to make up for it in another area."

Big banks that haven't performed should be broken up before they become a threat to the entire financial system, Mike Mayo tells CNBC. Bad corporate governance, not a fundamental weakness of capitalism, is at the heart of why people distrust banks, he says, citing Citigroup (C) and BofA (BAC) as examples of banks where shareholders should be able to remove ineffective executives.

Wells Fargo (WFC -1.5%) cancels a proposed $3 debit-card fee, following a bigger-than-expected backlash from consumers over the charges big banks tried to tag consumers with after the Durbin Amendment limited debit card swipe fees.

While it’s a good sign that some big banks have blinked, opting not to follow Bank of America's (BAC) lead in introducing new debit card fees, it will take much more for them to fully grasp that their mission should be to delight their customers more than their shareholders, Steve Denning writes. Banks "need to change the way everybody in the organization thinks, the way they speak, the way they act." Oct. 28, 2011, 3:17 PM | 8 Comments
JPMorgan Chase (JPM) won't impose new debit-card fees on customers - according to a WSJ report - joining some other big banks deciding to stay away from the kind of hornet's nest stirred up after BofA (BAC) slapped a $5 monthly fee on customers to help replace lost revenue. "Our customers said that would be a massive source of irritation for them," notes a Citigroup (C) exec shying away from the money grab.

Citigroup (C) is trying to put its subprime mortgage problems behind it with a settlement, but it first has to get past Judge Rakoff, who has rejected past deals that let banks off without any admission of guilt.

It looks a lot like the Fed is putting a big bank’s interests over those of taxpayers, Jonathan Weil writes, as it supports Bank of America’s decision to shift derivatives into a subsidiary filled with federally insured deposits. Fed priorities seem to lie with protecting BAC from losses, even if it means greater risks for the FDIC’s insurance fund - and taxpayers deserve to know why.

The California AG office reportedly subpoenas Bank of America (BAC) in an attempt to determine whether the bank sold investments backed by risky mortgages to California investors under false pretenses.

If you've ever doubted whether Bank of America (BAC) is in serious trouble, this development should settle it, says Naked Capitalism's Yves Smith.

More from the Oracle: "We agreed to hold it for at least 5 years, so what I'm thinking about is where Bank of America (BAC -4.2%) will be in 5 years; and nothing in the last 24 (or) 48 hours has changed my views on that." Of course, Buffett's position for now may be closer to a creditor rather than shareholder of BofA. Oct. 4, 2011, 3:31 PM
Sen. Dick Durbin keeps singing the same tune, railing on BofA's (BAC -5.2%) $5 debit card fee and urging small banks to lure customers away from mega banks: "It means an opportunity for these banks and credit unions who I hope will treat their customers a lot better than Bank of America." Lost in translation: Small banks stand to lose billions in revenue that the Durbin amendment stripped away, and "gifted" to retailers. Oct. 4, 2011, 3:15 PM | 8 Comments
Bank of America (BAC -3.9%) will close its correspondent lending business after failing to reach a deal to sell the unit to Fortress Investment (FIG -4.5%). Closing the unit would cut off a significant portion of the bank's mortgage origination volume, as loans purchased from correspondents accounted for $27.4B in originations during Q1.

Bank stocks (XLF -0.8%) get a bit of a Bernanke bump after the Fed chief testifies that Operation Twist will have the effect equivalent to a reduction of half a percentage point in the fed funds rate. MS and JPM, down big earlier, turn around, and UBS looks strong after expecting a "modest" Q3 profit. But Bank of America (BAC -3.3%) and Citigroup (C -2.4%) remain in the red.

Another day, another website outage (I, II) for online banking leader Bank of America (BAC -1.1%). After claiming last night the problems were fixed, customers are now greeted with a warning saying "you may wish to defer your transaction until a non-peak time." Are hackers really hacked-off by that $5 debit card fee?

Oct. 4, 2011, 12:50 PM
Pres. Obama weighs in on Bank of America's (BAC) new debit card fee: "You don't have some inherent right just to - you know, get a certain amount of profit... You have to treat [customers] fairly and transparently."

The price of protection against default by Morgan Stanley (MS) has naturally risen the past few sessions. Also note the sharp inversion of the curve, meaning it costs far more to insure against default today than tomorrow. It's a bit too remindful of 2008 for comfort and TARP 2 is likely politically impossible. What next?

New multi-year lows all around amongst the large banks: C -9.8%, BAC -9.6%, and MS -7.7% were hardest hit. GS -4.7%, WFC -3.9%, and  JPM -4.9% also taking lumps. Friday's news that the CA AG is pulling out of fraudclosure settlement talks and today's word the FHA may deny lenders payments due show how politically toxic the banks have become.

The first business day of Q4 sees some of the same old problems for Bank of America (BAC) with shares down 7% and its website inexplicably suffering outages again (previous) - handcuffing online banking customers. Latest damage control from BofA: "It’s not malware, it’s not hacking, there is no compromise to customer information. I know there’s people out there saying that. It’s not true."

The "next shoe to drop" on the banks could be a $13.5B hit from the FHA's denial to pay claims for money lost in home foreclosures, writes FBR's Paul Miller. The agency, he says, is under financial and political pressure to deny what have usually been automatic requests for payment.

Bank of America (BAC -2.7%) sinks below $6, hitting its lowest price since March 2009. The shares are about 15% lower than the level they were at when Buffett announced his investment in the bank. Like the Goldman and GE deals, the move may pay off for Buffett; for shareholders, not so much.

California pulls out of state and federal efforts to negotiate an end to the government's probe of alleged foreclosure abuses, dealing a blow to the bid to forge a $25B settlement with big U.S. banks.

The $5 debit card fee BofA (BAC -2.1%) plans to charge customers shouldn't draw their ire, argues The Atlantic's Daniel Indiviglio, as Congress is the one "gouging" American consumers. The new rule limiting the debit card fees banks can charge retailers should be revenue-neutral to consumers, but instead retailers are pocketing the difference (for now) and leaving banks looking like the bad guys.

Spreads widen on Morgan Stanley (MS -5.4%) five-year CDS to 455 bp, highest since March 2009. Bank of America’s (BAC -1%) spread also is up 3% to a record 410 bp.

Another day, another new bank fee. This time it's Bank of America (BAC +3.1%), as most of its customers will soon see a new $5 charge on their statements for any month in which they use a BofA debit card to make a purchase.

Bank of America (BAC) is -3.2% premarket to $6.18, within shouting distance of its late-August, pre-Buffett low of $6.01. Peter Tchir doesn't think yesterday's downgrade is a huge deal, but notes at the margin, firms will be less inclined to trade with a lower-rated counterparty, and - more importantly - could cut their trade lines with the bank.

Market recap: Operation Twist worked in pushing down long-term yields in the wake of the FOMC announcement, but stocks nosedived and the dollar soared as investors apparently wanted more.

BofA (BAC) finds a way for brokerage clients to keep their debit rewards in place by guiding them to credit card offers with similar terms after the Fed caps debit swipe fees at $0.21. The move - sure to be well-received by customers who love their debit card perks - isn't quite altruistic considering unregulated credit card swipe fees generate a cool $40B a year for banks and cardholders will pay interest if they carry a balance.

FDIC chief Martin Gruenberg thinks banks need to lend more, for their own sake. While profits have been surging, much of the growth has come from reduced loan-loss provisions.

Bank of America (BAC) is ramping up its foreclosure processing again, having sent out far more notices of default to borrowers in August than in previous months. Delays in processing artificially lowered foreclosure numbers over the past year due to the "robo-signing" scandal, so this new surge likely addresses loans that have been long delinquent.

Financial shares are again a sea of red in an otherwise mixed market. Their problems are well documented, but what really may be hurting is the Fed's apparent fixation on lowering long term rates even further.

The "only sane way" to fix Bank of America (BAC) so that it is "restructured, ready to support growth [and] support leverage" is through a classic Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Chris Whalen says.

Brian Moynihan (BAC), you just got "fleeced" by Warren Buffett, Doug Kass asserts. Kass figures the current value of the warrants, taken over 10 years, provides an extra 4.5%/year return on top of the 6% dividend on the preferred shares, for a total cost of capital to BofA of nearly 10.5%/year. If the bank really didn’t need the capital infusion, was it worth it?

JPMorgan comes out to defend Bank of America (BAC), and rumors begin to fly about Chase taking over BofA.

Stock buybacks are usually ill-timed, ineffective and costly, David Weidner writes, so "if your bank is buying, maybe you should sell." The problem with many buybacks is that CEOs try to time the market - not a good idea with the Dow at 12,000 - and they’re often offset by new shares offered to employees as options - and banks have handed out lots of them after the financial crisis.
